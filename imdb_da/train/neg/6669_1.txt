I saw this movie in my movie class. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. I got into it with an open mind and was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I've never been connected to this movie. The action was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the story, or rather the lack of it, was a problem. There was no central, connecting theme to the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western one? Kind, but no. I am all too twisted in movies, I have recently seen "Brick" and loved it, but the place where this movie went was just out there too. It was so weird, and if I wasn't going through the whole movie, I'd have gone out. The script was not horrible, but it was just everywhere. When this movie ended, I was just left confused and wished it had ended earlier. There was just something about this movie that didn't resonate, I understand more offbeat movies like "Fight Club" but I just didn't care about the characters at all.
