The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies, but this just didn't qualify. It's really just a bad attempt to show a cartoon slide slowly in mental illness, which again is not a bad plot, but it is badly done here. There are some scenes (like the end) that aren't meant to be fun, but actually made me laugh aloud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas mower, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
