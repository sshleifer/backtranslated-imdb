The monster from Enemy Mine has somehow made itself into a small mountain community where he has stayed. He is being chased by a female doctor-vigilante who is out to exterminate him. This female killer, resembling a refugee from a Motley Crue video, is driving a motorcycle and is trying to rescue a bunch of children who have chosen to have a Big Chill weekend just dab in the middle of the monster's grass. Depitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to attract attention away from the story, which resembles a poor version of the island of Dr. Moreau (and yes it's worse than that with Val Kilmer).
