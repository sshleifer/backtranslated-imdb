Barbara Streisand leads and stars in this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To get a chance to get an education, Babs enthusiastically pamperes itself as a boy who is not the most difficult thing to do since she is already resembling a boy anyway. At her new school, she meets many male classmates who have no trouble believing she is a guy. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out on the best of many moments of accidental humor when Babs' husband thinks she is a man, but pin 'him' to the ground, sitting on top of 'him' and looks lovingly into 'his' eyes .... * snicker *. <br/> <br /> mediocre film; splashy story of nothing particularly interesting.
