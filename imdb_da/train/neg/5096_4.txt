Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail-boy to fight TV station UBC (it's United Broadcasting Corporation); He does not work anywhere and offers ridiculous projects like "Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog" to the study leaders - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming Director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr Russell's proposal, but has no idea how to choose a hit TV show. His secretary Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who has duplicated as Russell's boyfriend, has a chimpanzee bugging Russell when he wants to watch television. Appears, the monkey sees all the popular shows, and can easily choose hits. Russell discovers the chimpanzee's talent and uses him to advance his own career. Understandably things get HAIRY to Russell and cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles chimpanzee (handled by Frank Lamping) works well; Raffles look bored and / or distracted during a couple of scenes when the chimpanzee should look interested; these could have been addressed with resumption or editing. A gentle satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit tv show! AND it's a monkey who gets a beer during the commercials (drinks in a Disney movie)! A look through the casting will reveal the bundle of fun TV actors to recognize and try to place. You could make a drinking game in honor of Raffles' beer guzzling by guessing actors and where you've seen them before. Here's a start - Hi, isn't it "Dr. Bellows" from "In Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
