Jean Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career by making the successor to the universal soldier. But did that movie save him? I think he goes to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first moment we see the inside of a plant where you can see the movie's bad guy. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the action (details follow). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (don't remember the name .... it doesn't matter anyway) and try to escape some muscle men. Of course they are the new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (like the movie). After a while Van Damme hits Goldberg, but then "mission" is interrupted. It was just a test (Is this movie a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Who's seen the first movie might think this is the most illogical thing that Van Damme's character could do). But it's a successor. And a "story" must come up. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "story". After approx. 20 minutes, a supercomputer hears a call to shut it down and stop the project. Of course, the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the plant, but the computer sends some soldiers to hunt (It will Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess what Goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a silly phrase for the audience before becoming asskicked. Fun? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "stories", Van Damme tries to save his daughter (by his wife - the reporter in the first movie). It comes to a final show where Van Damme fights the evil guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see for yourself. It's just too fun to tell). <br /> <br /> You'll see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Don't see it. But if you do, keep a sex pack with you!
