I hated this show when I was a kid. It was back in the day when the kids show signs that actually had accents, not just the gentle, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent, and Pufnstufs was southern. As one of the others mentioned, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch who wanted the whistle. It always seemed odd to me, probably because the whistle just annoyed me, and I wouldn't have been in any trouble taking it away! <br /> <br /> Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to the early 70s McDonald's commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf torn by McDonalds. At the height of McDonald's popularity, the television show (or rather their creators) sought to license McDonald's characters to their show, but when McDonald's fell, the television show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees at McDonald's advertising agency and voted for the actors to make television shows. McDonald's defendant and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland trial and find lots of articles about it.
