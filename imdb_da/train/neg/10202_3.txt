Murder with numbers is one of the movies you expect to be made for television, but it is not. Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving on bigger and better things), it's not a big surprise that this movie quickly falls away from memory to be replaced by important things. Like ... remember to lock your front door when you go out. Or put on clothes again when you come out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a police officer with personal problems (not all). Along with her new partner (a wet look Ben Chaplin), she is invited to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except that perps are a few teenage students who think they have planned and executed the perfect murder. As the study continues, there is a battle for will between Cassie and the greatest suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). The amazing problem here is that the two leaders are hopeless. Bullock, although she is very nice to look at, is about as credible in the role of a hardened cynical politician as Rodney Dangerfield (in fact he would be better!). Chaplin for his sins is a complete non-unit, and I'm sorry to put this movie on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, like the insidious creeping suspects, freely release themselves. As if risky drivers were not bad enough, a story that would send someone to sleep and a very predictable (but illogical) ending would shoot this movie in the head before it has a chance to run. <br /> <br /> "Murder with numbers" has absolutely nothing to do for it, even a relentless nude scene of Bullock would not solve it. Well, just a little, but still not enough to save it. Forgettable, predictable and superfluous - this is a movie that will not move the police picture forward. As Cassie probably says about his next case, there is nothing to see here people. Move along, keep moving ...
