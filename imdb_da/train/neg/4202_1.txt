... I need something here ??? "unexpected plot developments"? "plot twisting with subversive glee"? watch these viewers on the same Arquette vehicle that I have just exposed to myself (in a now overtly (deliberately) deliberate part of sadomasochism). I've just come to this site just to make sure no one else ever rents this stink. ... the movie was a nuisance to every person involved ... quick question: Did Sir Stevie read the manuscript before giving up his thumb to Kate C.? If that's the case, then it must be the same Spielberg as the green-haired "Howard Duck" ... don't give me that, "it was a hit game" shit - I guess Mssr. Reddin is not so happy ... The DVD deck promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story ..." History !! History ?? It's shit like this that makes old Bobby McKee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like geniuses ... Sundance ?? Berlin ?? Toronto ?? I have a home video of my cat that evokes more interest than Arquette's negative-dimensional depiction of the attacked loss ... and talks about deux ex machina to Mr. Stanley T .; thank god, just in time he seemed to have Dave call the police! and thank you shiva that the police had just caught the true killer ... what !!! Until the credits I was still waiting for it to be a kind of mob against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs Spielberg, you do not avoid rude: what the hell was the kitchen scene with "athlete foot in my step "gag ??? are you worse in this or "just cause" ?? i dunno ... hey movie lovers: why don't you make it a blast night and rent this together with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then sepukka (or is it seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
