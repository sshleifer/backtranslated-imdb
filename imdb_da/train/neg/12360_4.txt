Why would a person go back to someone who kicks them in the teeth, not once, not twice, but again and again. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that to find love, we must accept abuse (not just forgive it, but fully accept it). Gosh! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Of course I didn't realize my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As Bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many amazing aspects to this movie; But to justify the restoration of Eli and Tom, more character development would have been useful. We are never familiar with Eli's masochism, but we are actually led to believe that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very clear.
