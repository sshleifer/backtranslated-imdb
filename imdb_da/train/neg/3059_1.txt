Okay, I recently got a chance to rent this and see the Christmas cell overcome the martins. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I had to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish task in Spanish 5 we all had to see it. I want to tell you, usually when we watch a movie, we all talk about eating, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept where the jaw was open and wondered what the evil Mr. Pitch had to do next time. Would Merlin help Santa Claus?! or will his robotic train come and save the day? I'd suggest renting it because it's the biggest piece of waste I've ever seen and I love it for it. : D
