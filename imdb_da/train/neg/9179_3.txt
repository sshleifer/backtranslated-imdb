It's cheese. If all you want is a video game, complete with what looks like computer cutaway sequences to action, the movie was too cheap to actually create special effects, that's it. My friend and I actually had a good time seeing it, as the theater was mostly empty and we could hackle a little. This movie requires real uplift. <br /> <br /> Plot? There was a plot? OK, some stupid colleges or later types are invited to "this year's rave" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If they had only stayed back in Seattle, they would have survived." - Direct quote, or almost.) to participate. They come there and everyone is gone and the place is a bit broken (but hey, the cone is still full!). Using a crusty old captain and a coastguard (who only has a little less hard - and a little less good than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight with lots of zombies (some spitting acid), getting an ear of freaky legends, and getting killed . It's about it. It's not quite as bad as Demonicus, but not much, and still better than Severed (they are kind of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun to heckle, and the latter is just for freaking bad to see more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil, run away !!! run away now !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some real big questions (without many spoilers): Since when did the Spanish ships from the 18th century eat into the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is anyone in the Pacific Northwest smugglers, and to whom - CANADA, to cry aloud? Why is a rave on a named (oh, sorry, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) San Juan Island - and outdoors, and still remember this is THE PACIFIC NORTHWET. And the raven has about 30 people present - "this year's rave", my pato. <br /> <br /> Lucky stuff there are lots of hatchets around. Many of them. Everyone has them. Must be a hatchet point of sale nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, while the movie started playing with a little "parody" (with nudges I know what you did and jaws), it didn't go through OK enough - when the initial comments (in one voice-over not least) randomly mentions that one of the characters "gave his boyfriend to focus on her fence", you can be sure there will be some fences at the end of the movie. Not a good fence, but a few people are hacking each other with swords, anyway.
