"Die Sieger" was highly recommended to be one of the few good action films made in Germany. I saw it last night and I must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If it were to be "the last best hope" for entertaining and challenging German action cinema, then there is not much left. "Die Sieger" is trying to be sexy, bold and furious, but it's not that kind of thing. The characters are wood and stereotype, and when they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much) they act against their nature. It makes it difficult - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify them. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I think the movie is very bad cast. There is no sign I believe in. Maybe the superior officer on the SWAT - but it's about it. The people who try to look or act as special units like the elite police - I don't believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that bad. But I think it's badly said. You don't even know the bad guy - for example. And when after a "very dark" show down Karl Simon (the good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why? .. what for?" I asked myself the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. I sincerely hope - no - I think Germany can do better, even with action movies.
