The MST 3000 has to make this movie. It's the worst acted movie I've ever seen. First of all, you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and paying his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person would ever be allowed to be so close to a president not to mention a high-profile job. The POTHUS security officer would also not be so emotional that he would start drinking in a doze if the president was shot. This movie sucked. I can't express the extremity that this movie was. Every actor was horrible. Even chick on the trailer park. I scream at this waste. What a waste of time.
