Is it a stupid movie? You can believe that! I couldn't find a moment in this movie that was scary or scary. Stupid moments? Lots. Stupid characters? You can believe that. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Oh good people to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheese. He's the most whiny doctor I've ever seen. He has a melting man running amok in Ventura County somewhere, he's not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there are no crackers anywhere. Plus he has the non-helpful general on his obstacle who wants to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what is happening, though. Nelson can't tell him anything. There are also some random signs thrown in the good sense that encounter the merchant. Eventually the movie ends and out, monster gets scooped in a trash can to be compost. In the end, it's just what you need for a great MST episode.
