The teasers for Tree of Palme try to pass it on as a kind of allegory to an adventure with actual meaning, so immediately start raving about the animation. I should have known what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character Palme is a good example of the whole movie's problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of. Like all the characters in the movie, Palme is poorly defined. You don't bind with the characters, even though Shatta has acquired a couple of girls. It seems that the author was more interested in telling all the drama and complexity he could in this movie than actually exploring his people's motivation and personalities. New, useless story lines were introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The author was in serious need of streamlining his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was simply too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I cannot do without whether a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited to a television series or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie I simply couldn't endure the sheer lack of quality anymore and began to laugh at how constructed the characters, relationships, and the whole plot were. I touched my companion and he started jumping up, just like a young man was sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply couldn't take the terrible quality of this movie. On the bright side, the animation is incredible, and the viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs. The animation almost leads you; When you don't care about the signs, it tells you how you feel.
