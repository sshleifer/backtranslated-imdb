This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably not Robin-Hood costume and ignores all person's features in him that really matters. This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. And poor captain Hook a TOTAL clown. And of course, as every Disney cartoon should have a character that has had too many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys one. The only sign that has not been argued in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? Darling parents don't even have time to notice their kids are gone !!! Probably one of the most important points in the original story, and they destroyed it! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a fantastic piece of it. There are no timber and no squirrels - one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It is strange that he himself had lost his shadow, and she helped him hold it. (Though for his shoes and that makes no sense to me.) <br /> <br /> Destroying a great story like this just to entertain children should be illegal. So now know if you haven't known it before - this Disney version has nothing in common with the original story - which is not a children's story but just a great, big story. <br /> <br /> This irritates me without end.
