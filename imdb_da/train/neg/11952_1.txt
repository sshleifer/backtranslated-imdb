His first film, after the long friend John Bellow's death, shows Aykroyd much fatigue trying to draw a sign that would have been a moment for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives us bogus professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to avert a rival known only as mother. It's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies in the evening to protect, and a Pimp's Dinner (or something) to attend. It is no wonder that Aykroyd seems to be stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
