There is only one thing I need to say about this movie - the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra's character about wanting to be a genius; Never watch this movie. The story is horrible, the play is terrible (see, it's Shaq!), And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (just as horrible) twice before ever watching this movie.
