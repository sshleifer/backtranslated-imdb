I was a little interested in this movie as a trashy cannibal flick. I was thoroughly disappointed. It was the same kind of disappointment I felt seeing 'Friday the 13th: Jason taking Manhattan'. so much potential wasted! <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a decent attention grabber. then it laughs at a stop. abundant breasts and egregious 80s fashion can't help this movie. the only thing eating near this island of cannibal monks is the piranha! I'm not asking for "cannibal holocaust" level of gore, but I was looking for cheap over-the-top exploitative gore. I have nothing of it. <br /> <br /> I found a few parts of the battle scenes somewhat exciting, hence the 2 stars. I don't think it's really worth it to see it. I could see it at a party where no one cares about what's going on and you just want something in the background. but I didn't want to tell anyone, "Oh, guy, you can see this movie." It is neither good enough nor bad enough to justify much attention.
