As many others have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst I have seen. There are no direct references to movie clips or sequences in this comment because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I got the feeling that I was watching an episode of a TV show or something where they had got a team of some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I've seen worse of them) ... All in all, it is quite offensive to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge of computers and / or technology at all. There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself praying for everything to end - quickly - halfway through. In addition, there are countless "easy way out" scenarios, which are also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking person ... This film is quite in comparison with the old "Wargames" and I think it is a shame they must even call it a successor. Two stars from me because of one thing and only one thing: The actors' notions are not half bad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they might work with. Still, they should never have logged on to this movie. Not really a career move, but I suppose we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who gave this movie the top score ... you have to be on the studio payroll or something that is My only explanation. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has not seen this one: Look at it all and see your own mind. But lower your expectations of the floor (and then some).
