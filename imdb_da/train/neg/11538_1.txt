A really horrible movie that left me feeling sullied by having seen the forty minutes or so I could stand. Not the actors' fault, but the author / director, producers, financiers, etc. Need a very stiff speaker to. Maybe it means it's deep. It is not. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike the core of Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human understanding. There are also no straw dogs that I have seen compared to. Rather, it feels like something Pete Walker may have turned his hand to, but even to say that I'm probably a little unfair on Pete Walker. Revenge is a strong human desire, but the bedroom window has more to say about it and male emasculation than this pitiful effort. I don't think it's particularly misogynistic, just too happy in its portrayal of certain details - the blood runs down GA's leg post, couple example. It is neither challenging nor confrontational, although I am sure the filmmakers consider themselves very daring, just deeply unpleasant. Is this as high as we can aim for? Is that why they involved making movies? (I wrote here the Latin phrase that translates as Oh the Times! Oh the duty! But the new spell check on IMDb wouldn't let me send it until I had removed it. Likewise, I had to remove square brackets. Download the sorted IMDb. ) <br /> <br /> Where is the high aspiration? The noble impulse? When you look at British film - Ealing or the Boulting Brothers happy comedies; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on the fallen idol, our husband in Havana or the sublime The Third Man (a movie that has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads); Powell & Pressburger's work; or if you want to talk about sex, see violence and male emasculation on "The Offense" Dir. Sidney Lumet, from an original play by John Hopkins; Check out "Tunes of Glory" for something worth doing, it has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the foregoing, Straightheads, unfortunately, is a totally hateful celluloid waste.
