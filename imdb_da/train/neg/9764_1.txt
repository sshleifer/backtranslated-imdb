In a word ... abysmal. I give it a star for hippie sex scenes and eyeglasses women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, nobody bore. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently hit by the cast. I can't believe this is going to be on DVD (from 2/15/05) with "Wild In the Streets" - another retro stink. I woke up ill in bed tomorrow with a cold, decided to watch a movie to greet me some, scanned the digital channels ... the premise looked interesting enough because I like to watch B-movies sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellion teen flicks. It was known somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Only after seeing it, I now know why knowledge crept into my newly awakened brain's recesses. I remembered seeing the attractions of this movie as a 14-year-old (I'm 45), back in the early / mid-70s at Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughs hysterically and even groaned high on how bad this movie looked. Action: horrible, story: horrible, filmography: almost horrible, music: horrible, sound: horrible, controlling: a joke. If you choose to see this after my warning, remember ... "I told you." <br /> <br /> "Gas sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gas" after watching this modest movie - or maybe you have to be taken to a "gas" chamber to waste your brain away. I've seen homemade Super 8 movies that put this movie in shame. Absolutely a new addition to my top 10 WORST movies all the time ... it's up there (down there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
