The lid of the box makes this movie look really good, don't be fooled. The splatter university came out in 1984, which was the last good year of horror, but this movie sucks. The characters are so annoying. Only the teacher is tough. who is like no plot to this movie, who in hell would ever produce this waste of a movie? <br /> <br /> Spoilers forward <br /> <br /> The teacher dies in this and it was a female we all know we should have a female survivor if you have to break the rules, do it in a good scare, not this waste
