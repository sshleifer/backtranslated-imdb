and it does not help rohmer the matter that a few years later, Syberberg came together and did a staggeringly great job on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie didn't "It doesn't look that bad when it came out without the syberberg movie comparing it that was probably shot at an even smaller audio stage with fewer resources. In fact, I can't remember at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg movie. The only thing I know is that the German version is pure magic, while it looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> the music ... la musique ... is not even credited here on IMDb ... but someone based it on "12th to 14th century airs" or something ... well it is not a big help to the movie. It comes out as unauthorized and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher !!! <br /> <br /> Rohmer is one of the French writers who like its leading men, who are generally quite uninteresting too, and it doesn't help. Syberberg's Parsifal was cute and can be seen on German TV today selling a kind of special bike he invented .... <br /> <br /> I think to think about what is looking at the syberbergen on video, is like. I remember last watching the movie in a theater, the pressure was so bad that the experience was a huge 5 hour travesty. But even then it would be necessary to go beyond what this version has to offer, I'm afraid. point for earnestness, for chutzpah, but ... this movie simply needed Beau-Coup more bucks. it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript it looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh and yes, it just ends very randomly with Parsifal, who goes to church and this cheesy passion game gets involved ... blah!
