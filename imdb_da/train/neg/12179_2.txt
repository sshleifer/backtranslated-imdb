Not even worth seeing this sticky spoiler ruining everything about 'Annie'. The signs seem almost cheaper from the badly written story and they have low quality for the production. It was very clearly made for television, but if I found it on my television, I would merge it right over. The children in the film do a good job, but the adults appear incredible and so the film really fails to pull you in. This movie lacked the music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and really takes the look of Annie we only love. Johnson, since Annie is sometimes annoying and overwhelmed. You can't convince yourself that she really is Annie. The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me through the duration of the film. Sad to say that this successor was a total flop.
