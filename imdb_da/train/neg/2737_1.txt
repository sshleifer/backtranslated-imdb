There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; Most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot using a bit of uneven stretch, but it didn't. Cut, three lines into the next endless sequence of boring clips ... OK, so maybe they were short on production time, but they would have been better off skipping this episode altogether. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it was done, actually. Scrubs are usually much better at suppressing the tropics, but somehow it came through .... Thank you for being back in shape at the next episode.
