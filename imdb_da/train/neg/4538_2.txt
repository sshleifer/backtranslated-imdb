I actually went to watch this movie in a theater, but what a waste of time and money! Bad play, I'm sorry to say, didn't help me enjoy this slightly sticky manuscript. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go see this movie as James Redfield, author of the book, was very much involved in the manuscript. They really enjoyed the book, so the movie was just perfect. Well maybe I had my hopes a little too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet for a point I actually left, I had to be vomited and worst of all that will be a successor! Make the world a service and stop this horrible crusade.
