This has been put on the DVD market by Alpha and it is only for die-hard Boris Karloff fans (like Moi). It's not a horror-flick, but a drama where Boris is a giant scientist who agrees to kill a wealthy woman's husband to get the wealth needed to continue her work. But when the dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his spouse, hell goes loose. <br /> <br /> Seeing Karloff as another selfish creepy type is good enough, and some of the actors are inadvertently hilarious (especially from leading lady Mona Goya, who is definitely a laughing breath as the double-crossed wife). <br /> <br /> Keep on with great caution.
