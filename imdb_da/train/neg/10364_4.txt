The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-TV movie will move you, but then, as it deviates more and more from the book, you take out all the religion and love and mathematics and put in Candy cotton clich√©s, it becomes boring. Nevertheless, from the comments I have heard, people who have not read the book have had it, and if it itself leads the child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' uncle Albert (I love to laugh). Nothing is quite as grossly provoking as the signs on the screen laugh fun at things that are completely unfunny.
