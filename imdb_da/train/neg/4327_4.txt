Some funny humor, some that fall flat, some decent actions, some that are pretty terrible. This movie is simply hit and miss, guaranteed to entertain 12 year old boys more than any other niche. The children's actors in the movie are just unfunny. When you make a family comedy, it tends to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises over the material to give fun, and dare I say it, human achievement in the midst of this mediocrity.
