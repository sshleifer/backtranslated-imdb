The Japanese sense of pacing, editing and musical score must be different from American taste, but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post-production work. Anyone in Hollywood has to make this movie again, and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and scary. There is something about the city's edges, gritty policemen, earthquakes, sanitaries and mysterious saltwater murders that are enough to be captivating. However, this story only needs to make a little sense and maybe be approx. 40 minutes shorter. I must say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie, and it was clear from the start. <br /> <br /> As it stands, only the deadly Japanese film lovers should interfere with watching this oh-so-boring movie.
