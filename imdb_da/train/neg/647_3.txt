The action was horrible as well as the manuscript. It was poorly composed and made you almost laugh at the many terribly executed murder scenes. The end was even worse. Everyone kept dying, but somehow it ended up looking like everything was OK! They didn't give enough history about the obsession that the teacher had, etc. The film needed more time to perhaps develop a better story. The only reason to give this 3/10 is that I feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could really have made this an OK movie, but the script and action failed miserably.
