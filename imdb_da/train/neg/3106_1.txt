When I make a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always on it. It has no redeeming properties at all. It took a will to sit through it all, and I would previously waste my own blood than I have to sit through again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on a Saturday night. I was the only ones in the theater myself and a bunch of loud, boisterous, rather troubled teens sitting somewhere behind me. Of course, they were having a good time on a Saturday night and had come to this "comedy" for some laughs. Before the movie starts, during the previews, they laughed and funny and made bright comments with a great old age. It was borderline annoying; They still had their outrageous enthusiasm in the film itself, I might have said something, but I felt tolerant and empathetic of their lively fun, so I let it go. And they settled down when the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" of the effect, it had not only on myself but on this wavy bunch. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, no one was laughing at the theater. Not even. Not myself, not the boisterous children. Absolute silence, except for the soundtrack. And when the film was over and the lights came on, we all, all of us, were slowly filed from the theater in slow, gloomy, absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect this "comedy" produced. Don't laugh, not pleasure, but absolutely DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the least bit of fun. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not fun. <br /> <br /> I consider Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" to be on the Funniest Movie Ever list. It is certainly certain that the same gentleman could be responsible for probably the smallest funny movie ever. <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, give this movie a whirl; Otherwise, don't say I'm not warning you.
