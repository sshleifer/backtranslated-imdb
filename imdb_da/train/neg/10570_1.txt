Don't let MPAA fool you with their "Nominated R for extreme violence". There is absolutely no extreme violence in this boring part of s * t. I had expected some cheap rambo 3-type actions that the trailer promised, but it's just boring boring rubbish with tons of lame slow flashbacks that doesn't make sense. AVOID!
