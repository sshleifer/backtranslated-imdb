A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinion constituted a judgmental destruction with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon seed. The fear was omitted and replaced with a general dull effect, which could possibly be terrible, but instead showed a poor dose of beliefs that mocked each other despite the title itself. Being a fan of the Masters of Horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twisted with its sordid pictures as a spider's old rocking chair after being put on. I see this episode that threw away from the guys, never really go anywhere other than see it through for what it's worth and relieved when it finally came to "The End" ..
