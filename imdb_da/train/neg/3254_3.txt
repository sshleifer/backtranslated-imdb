Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this movie comfortable to watch and of course, this cute petite gal burned up on the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien is disturbed as a police officer and decides to call it stop and return to her hometown and return to her roots and her father, who is the local sheriff. Her father is getting older and the city has changed, gangsters have taken over the city and started getting local women to turn tricks and the city's people got sick and tired of their city to hell. Well, you can almost guess what's going on and you're right, China O'Brien struggles back after great tragedy hits his life. Poorly works through the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this movie to a wonderful conclusion.
