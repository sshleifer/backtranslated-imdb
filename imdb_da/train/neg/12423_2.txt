Cage (1989) was another of the low-budget "buddy" action flicks that were produced during the 80s thanks largely to the 48hrs movies. and deadly weapons. This one star Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as for former Vietnam Vets which happen to be running a local dive bar. Rope takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and is now quite soft. Although he is huge, Lou has the brain of a child. One day some ruffians throw their wait at the bar, and Lou and Rebb knock the tar out of them. But payback is a mother. They rush the bar and leave Lou and Reb with nothing. It is until these two bullies get into the picture (one of them is a really nice guy) who has a plan in mind. The movie is a waste of time. Maybe if they went all that way and did a hard core action instead of trying to downplay the cruelty of the situation it might have worked. Alas, it doesn't, and the audience is holding the bag. Oh good. It's too bad because you have all the elements for a great B movie. Better luck next time I think. <br /> <br /> not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
