Terrible! Terrible! No plot, no point, no end. It looks like the instructor turned the camera on and then the whole crew went for lunch. Every day. I'm trying to give this video away, but nobody wants to take it. I give it a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I have to say thumbs down on this one. <br /> <br />
