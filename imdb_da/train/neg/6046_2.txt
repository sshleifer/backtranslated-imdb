This movie is basically two hours of Dafoe character who drinks - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you didn't have enough traces or sign skills to be surprised. It was just a nasty, boring waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an outstanding actor. Peter Stormare is an outstanding actor. But this movie just sucked. Slowly, the film doesn't make it bad, it was just bad. The outlined plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic details is not coherently drawn together in a meaningful way to a plot except to highlight some gore illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I appreciate the artistic vision, but as an entertainment I sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointing.) I generally don't like making negative comments or reviews on other people's works, even when they suck, but this movie justifies one. It's just too bad that these great actors were ashamed of this end result.
