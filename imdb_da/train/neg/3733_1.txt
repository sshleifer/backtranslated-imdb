Weak, obsolete, tired, clumsy; want to be the Basic Instinct, but miss the opportunity for new perspectives, new insights. Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the brief redeeming value; Oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes long ... it just got * worked * much longer! I'd rather clean the bus station toilets with my toothbrush than to sit through here again. I express an opinion here: I think that means I didn't like it.
