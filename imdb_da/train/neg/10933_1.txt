Out of every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout Mormons, you'll see that they've all played in this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally, Kurt Hale's fortunes have changed (thank you) and hopefully it will take a long time before we see any of his features in theaters. The camera was amateurish (I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). The reason was limp and very unfunny. You really didn't understand why anyone did anything. It was as if I had sand in my eyes and a 300 pound lady was sitting on my face, it was so painful. The only reason I didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me down
