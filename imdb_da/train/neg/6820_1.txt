This stupid, incredible narrative is only redeemed by the opening scene, where a hard-boiled policeman delivers some almost audible lines confirming our greatest fear: he's dead. Perhaps the film would have been rescued if the director had rejected the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sad-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a non-naming hack from the street could save such a bowl water movie is no less likely than a villain who commits murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; His promise is enormous. Perhaps we will be treated to more screen time of this unclear thespian if there is ever a sequel to this unwanted movie.
