Incredible. Does it get any more stupid than this? Not a chance. The stupidity of this movie would be ashamed of Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had mediocre dialogue and the other had a poor dialogue, then it has a Cretan dialogue. Amazing. But this time, history has been lowered to the level of dialogue as well. Despite the play and the dialogue, I liked the first two movies, but "Cube Zero" will definitely kill the franchise. The completely moronic plot apparently stems from a frustrated left-wing pen. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if such leftists themselves realize how anti-democracy and pro-dictatorship they are. In this film, of course, are they targeted at the United States? a democracy. Why aren't they targeting Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. In anti-military films? Sure, most of these sites are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon, but it's next to that point. It is obvious: Writers of waste, like this, actually admire these regimes, whether or not they are aware of it. I would even go so far as to say that anyone who constantly attacks the US foreign policy has anti-democratic beliefs in its core. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: Apart from being so far fetched that it's not even fun anymore, the movie has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason, the two men who oversee the dice have been doing it for a while and are unaware of the pain and sadism that the project entails, but the first one the other suddenly turns to the system! Anyone who has any idea of ​​human nature will look right through this idioci. Or how about the cretinous character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat, who speaks as if he's in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature arrives, the movie loses ALL seriousness and thus every chance of being exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
