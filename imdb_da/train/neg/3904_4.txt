I confess - in my opinion, Emma is the only greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the top of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest. Comparison with the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable - the version is far more faithful to the book's witty spirit and far more comfortable to see. There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (formerly played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes a suitable decorative Frank Churchill. Production is great, but the decor is far too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several major issues. The first is Mark Strong - first he does not really see Mr Knightley. It may be because he plays the role of a Censor Victorian priest. It's very out of tune. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of the length. It is simply said that the film is too short - to get the right kind of sensation, it will need to be twice as long. Finally, and most significantly, is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream - all dialogue is already there. It should only be trimmed and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. Firstly, it's a pretty bleak movie, and the last thing Emma should be is bleak. More clearly, Davies has seen it appropriate to rewrite the end as a kind of bucolic party. What planet, or less work by Thomas Hardy, does it come from? It is completely out of the novel's style and spirit. And I think it is very presumptuous to try to make improvements in perfection. <br /> <br /> See the Paltrow version, or see Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
