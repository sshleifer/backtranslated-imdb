It sounded like a really interesting movie from blurb. Nazis, occult, government conspirators. I expected a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci Code or Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something completely different, more psychologically, more like David Lynch. It was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful. Part of the hassle is the casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character begins to move slightly modest and frightened. She just doesn't do it well, even at her age, even though she certainly tried. The actor threw as his son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most other actors also thought that this was a campy movie, or at least acted like it, rather than just quirky. The only one I thought did really well was daughter Siri Baruc. Another big part is pacing. It starts very slowly. So slowly you may be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes convincing for a while when you come to the daughter's suicide and aftermath. But shortly it all becomes a shaken mess. Some of this was on purpose, but much of it was just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and poorly focused. The real problem is that it is simply not a pleasant movie to watch. It is slow, boring, none of the signs are sympathetic. Overuse of images and sets. Some movies you see characters are tortured. In this, it is the viewer who does it. It has a few scary moments, especially the creepy Nazi paintings and credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiring.
