Poored "blaxploitation" crime drama aimed entirely at the black urban market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier stars in the title role, that a nurse who becomes a female vigilante after the drug dealers, makes Coffy's little sister a junkie. Violent nonsense plods together doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only Grier's dazzling temperament gives the story a shock (she is not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primary way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson did at this time, the film was marketed and announced as crass exploitation, but still managed to find a large audience within the cities. Today, however, it is only a footnote in 70's film history, and lacks the wide appeal of other films in this genre. * 1/2 from ****
