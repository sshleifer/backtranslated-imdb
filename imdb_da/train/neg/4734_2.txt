Do you like beautiful girls? Yes me too. What is bad to say about beautiful girls / women? No imo, so why would I only give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, even though it got "talents" by Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to see beautiful people, I'd see MTV or something why. This is a movie, a so-called action movie anyway. So by definition does it not really really need a plot right? I do not accept 100%, but let's say yes to it. So what does it need? 20 minute footage from part 1 (I can exaggerate a bit, but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)?! It would be "no". But then again you never know that the people who looked at a part might not know what they were eating this morning for breakfast, so please let us remind them ... hey maybe remind them twice more? Just to make sure they don't forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course! <br /> <br /> Forget about the story, about character development, about real feelings, about the "play" (and no, I don't think women in skirts walking and / or fighting are responsible for acting!). .. what is it leaving? Yes action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that is why I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / see, believe me ...
