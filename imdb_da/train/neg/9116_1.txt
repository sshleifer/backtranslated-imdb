There is not a decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams is one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. That guy playing Sebastian sucks too. He doesn't even look like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are also terrible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is also crap. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (About Triangle): If you can't beat them ... Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat them? <br /> <br /> Lame. The end contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clear that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, except that she was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him". She was a tease that liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his will. So in this P.O.S. It means he can get her with a girl on the side. What? And we also don't see the meat. It is implied, it makes it not only stupid, meaningless and contradictory, but also worthless. <br /> <br /> And in the first, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love and made him a loser. Although he won the game, his chances crumbled. So in this excrement he loses and falls in love. So she doesn't screw "losers", only complete losers? Another thing: It is said that Sebastian has never been in love, so what do you call the Virgin Girl case? <br /> <br /> In the end, the maiden is suddenly revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun down) and, as I said, they go into a lame offscreen triangle. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other plot contradictions. See the author himself the first movie? A 5 year old can point out his stuff. <br /> <br /> After three-hearted, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin who destroys her innocent mind in the back of a limo, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sitting in front, listening and smiling evilly into the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... Seing Sebastian gets the asshole, he was in the first one who could have made an interesting movie. I think everything it took to get a little Sebastian bad was a triangle with two hot girls. Interesting.
