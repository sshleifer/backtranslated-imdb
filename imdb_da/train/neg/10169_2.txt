It's 1978, and of course there are too many black players on the teams! Fans will be disturbed, and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy, there are so many black players on the pitch! This made for TV Super Bowl movies can be seen. It is not much more, but it is truly a surprising cast of talented actors who are (currently), most likely especially Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any goodness brings Selleck to the screen, is quickly trumped by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a silly story of super bowl betting. PJ Jackson is charged by "New York" (read mafia) to make sure the game ends for their favor, in this case a $ 10 million bet. PJ is innocent enough and seems to have a loose understanding by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspecting Lainie, takes responsibility. For a while, the mystery of murder is not known, but is clearly revealed by the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist. It's a bad movie, but can be seen. The action is decent and the movie is ok. At least there were no stupid typical 70's car tickets (they don't have their place right here). Just keep an open mind about past stereotypes and the cocaine era and you survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
