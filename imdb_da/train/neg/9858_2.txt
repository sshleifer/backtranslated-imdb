This movie is not fun. It just takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters are less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially retarded, and they do not succeed with the women. The jokes are horrible and imaginative, as two of the players are knocked out of a black midget because one of them had a KKK cap (it was his witch) and the other guy had a John Rocker warm up how much fun. he is a geek, so he does not know about sports). You may need to be a childish high school to find any of these fun things. Badly executed mock coins are so painful to look at, but of course very cheap to make. I'm sorry Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess these are the only options for hotties way past their prime.
