The Earth is destined not to be more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said he was duped to appear in this by his producers who told him that lots of great actors were involved) is Dad Pergado and gets his usual serious and frightening routine. The throw is not that bad, though most people have now gone from acting. The movie has horrible sound effects (mainly created by pressing keys on an old computer it seems) and the ridiculous thinking over time - shows a scene of the sky, for example, for what feels like at a time. Despite this, the story is quite humorous in a world-condemned way and production is sufficient. Interestingly, a scene equipped with Albert Band and wife Jackie; Meda Band; Author Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's Assistant Bennah Burton. Despite its plodding nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked and so liked it.
