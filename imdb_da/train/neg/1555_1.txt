When I decided to watch the BARBARIA, starred with the two twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movie. Well, BARBARIENER is remarkably cute action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN BARBARIAN and fails at all levels. The film's appearance is all wrong. Some scenes were well shot, but the tone and the shiny, sticky "disco" look of clothing and hairstylers are adorned with, just making no sense at all, even for a low budget match like this. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with the ridiculous hairdresser and costume. He was supposed to be threatening, but he comes across as a purse. And it is fun to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL CHILDREN, appearing in her first movie and walking around in shiny fur bikini. I'm sure she wants this boy to disappear from the earth's surface! The so-called barbaric twins are in order as the muscular heroes, but it is almost impossible to construct a proper criticism of their action because their roles as anything else in this mess are very poorly understood. The only way the film tries to differentiate a twin from the other is to have a twin who wears a lingerie covering his butt while the other twin's lingerie hardly covers his muscular shock. I'm not making fun! Don't ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this movie. And his desperation is perfectly reflected in this rough flick. It's just bad.
