For some reason, in the late 70s and early 80s, the local CBS affiliate station in New York played this movie in its late night slot on Friday or Saturday night in several years, usually at. 2 or sometimes. It's a suitable movie for that time slot, as it's very hard to follow and quite strange (see the other reviews for specific history information). Anyway, after catching it many times in the days just before cable TV (and even after it hit, but before they offered much all night programming), I kept catching this little inferiority. After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Now it's only available (from any search I've made anyway) in a beautiful miserable print on the budget tag "Brentwood Video" as part of a 4-pack movie (4 movies on 2 double-sided discs) called "Alien Worlds" if any is interested. It is usually available for about $ 10, but even much less if you shop around. The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in many other public domain movie collections, so there's no need to comment on them here. But I haven't seen "Eyes" available elsewhere. Although it is hardly a "restored" version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once, the 90-minute run of IMDb is not correct. Even with 92 minutes of driving time, it is not unusual for a movie to be doubled in English from another language to also have some of the driving time trimmed. It seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered important to history. Would a longer version make something less confusing? Who knows it really - unless you've seen it in the mother tongue ... By the way, my attempts to see this during the day are not trying and I end up turning it off. There is something to see this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie. Or maybe it's just from my past experiences who knows ??
