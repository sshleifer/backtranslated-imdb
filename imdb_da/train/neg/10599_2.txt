** HOW IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The Government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and able to do more damage than before. But the government is the cut, the project threatened, and the supercomputer, which is in the middle of everyone, feels threatened so he takes steps to secure his own security. He activates and controls UniSols and begins to drive chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about a thing. Choreographed matches. The story is bad and will soon be drowned in all matches. Whatever happens and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie it is not fun to see a game where you know that part of it is indestructible. Usually, you are absolutely sure the hero will win, but you will still feel the fighting is between two equally-sized campaigns. Not where you are indestructible and can't lose. Then the fighting becomes just a tool for stretching time. You wait for the final battle when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat its unbeatable enemies. To further reduce my opinion is a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie, how much badly dressed women are. Well, not many of them, because the characters are most men (there is at least one woman UniSol herself), but almost all women are unnecessarily shown with at least just one bra once. The female leader goes on with this, but we also pass through a strip club (to use a computer no less) with much more undressed women. These moments give nothing to the story and are just there to try to delight the youth-minded male audience. So in conclusion, boring battles. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
