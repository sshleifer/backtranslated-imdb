I've seen many movies and rarely would I ever consider a movie "1" but this movie was beyond horrible. The action was horrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the signs were annoying. Usually when I see scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a sound in house / forest / school / etc and then shout out "hello is there anyone?" - But at least they are trustworthy when they do it. This movie couldn't even get it right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other B horror films like Venom and The Fog look like an academically award-winning masterpiece. I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I am writing this comment so everyone else thinking about watching this movie will think again. IT'S AWFUL!
