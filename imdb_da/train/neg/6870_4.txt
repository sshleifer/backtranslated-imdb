A well-meaning film about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), wife of the devoted Talmudic teacher Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply dissatisfied Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the area where she is already an expert ?? jewelry. He also starts an affair with her, and when she spends time with a Portuguese artist, he dumps her and betrays her to the family who closes her out. There is a subplot where Sonja's death brother speaks to her and apparently takes the form of a magic beggar woman, but why isn't it clear. Much is not clear, unfortunately, including what is happening to Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe who is in her fire and maybe it is not from God and what it means and what the magic beggar woman tells her means. History largely affects the situation of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, yet Sonja is not even liberated. Nor is the idea of ​​being redeemed by the love of another race that is very well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman? And yet it is the bastard transmitter who quotes it to Sonja. Zellweger fights with that part; she was supposed to be a Jew from the middle of the west and sometimes her accent is flat, and in other times it is taken on Brooklyn's distinctive sounds. She is best when she is tough and takes responsibility, but ultimately the movie is a mess.
