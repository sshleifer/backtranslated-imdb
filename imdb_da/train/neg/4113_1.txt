I have to finish watching a movie when I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was agonizing to sit through. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" moving, the way the evil shoots hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seems to hit innocent spectators, the predictable result and all the bad plays were just awful. As the girl who finds the reporter in her friend's apartment and goes from "what is it you do in here (holding a bat)" to "hi, you are sweet, you will @ # $%! ???" in just 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and play with your kids (or dogs)!
