Man I must say when I saw the trailer I was thrilled. Futuristic soldiers taking vicious ass vampires led by genre vet Michael Ironside .... In the room. I think I don't expect high art, but it looked like a potential B movie classic. This was undoubtedly a television pilot, reedited some time later in a feature film after it had not been picked up. Okay, I start with the movies getting good points, the action was competent for a lower budgeted movie, and the CGI and the sites used were acceptable. Now on the bad, first time Michael Ironside was barley in this, and his performance here .... yes it was cheesy not in a good way. But, as I said, he wasn't much at all, so I can't blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA type group for Vampires', no I'm not funny, it's the stupid most incredible thing I've seen over time, and it's taken seriously. Also this film commits to one of the great B-movies sins, it teases a lesbian scene and does not deliver. Most of all that sinks this movie is nothing that really happens. Since it was supposed to be a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and it does not have a regular end. Even the biggest villains only come to the end. If there's ever a movie needed to dig up the Sleaze and Gore factor, it's Vampire Wars. Eventually I would say the main staff of the space ship were all very talented actors and could very well put this mess behind them and continue to bigger and better things. They just had nothing to work with here.
