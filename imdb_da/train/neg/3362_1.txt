The Haunting is another bad scare reaction with fake overdone special effects and a great cast of on-screen favorites and has no redeeming features at all except perhaps for cinematography.Yes remakes are not all bad, but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont are certainly. I suppose the A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts to scare that audience, but it's a movie, not a magazine for magazine we do not care if we are interested in the characters and the story two things, this movie was missing. The story is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and tearing it out in four chapters and then using what is left for the movie, it's so boring and much of it is inexplicable. The characters are pretty thin, and while the play is good, you don't care about any of the characters. Lily Taylor gives a horrible performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when she delivers her lines, not to mention what a horrible screamer she is. Lily Taylor is not made for the horror genre at all. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost, and the ghost of Hugh Cain resembles a fat guy dressed as the ugly reaper for Halloween with a smoker. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms, which is a huge purple mouth, and it is not even fun unintentionally just sad. The house is beautiful and well designed, it is probably the only positive thing about this movie, it looks good, but it doesn't save it from the brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt I was wasting my time watching Haunting on TV at no cost so I would have been even more pi $$ if I had paid to watch it, but fortunately it was on Scream Channel. Overall The Haunting is a dull remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a bad attempt at horror.
