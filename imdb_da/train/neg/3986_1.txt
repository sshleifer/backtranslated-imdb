When I refer to Malice as a film noir, I do not look like such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor do I compare Director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I just record a protest against the darkness that permeates this movie from start to finish, to the extent that you simply can't figure out what's going on. I can understand the darkness of night scenes, but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, why I'm about to lose weight to understand. However, it would not have made much difference if Director Becker had filmed it in total darkness.
