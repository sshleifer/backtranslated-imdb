This is a bad movie of any standard. The story of Match Point had a certain plot and direction and write some fascination (Woody Allen blends his own culture with the classic English murder and explores what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> However, scoop has none of this. It's badly written, the two leaders are hopeless wood and the story itself has no interest at all. The genre that it spoofs at least requires some kind of subplot with witty explanations and links (why are tarot cards and keys held under French horns in locked rooms?). Allen's lovely and witty versions of various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us so much joy over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a good central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration has left him this time.
