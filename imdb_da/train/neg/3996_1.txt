I can't see what everyone liked about this movie. The show was too long and talky, and when it was finished, the main character remained as flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene. After the movie finally got Cusack into the eponymous hotel room, I had to wonder what should happen next hour or so to keep me engaged. The answer: not much, just John Cusack has a long, pronounced mental division. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the Cusack character had more depth. . Perhaps if his freak-out was a more thorough reworking of his everyday life. . . Maybe if the movie had either better developed its semi-baked themes of loss and faith or hadn't tackled them in the first place. . . Maybe if the movie had chosen to be either psychologically scary or thrill-trip horror and had fully embraced one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I watched this movie with two other horror buffs, and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the creepy episode of the hotel archive, the alarmingly crazy lady with the hammer, and the so stupid-it-was fun cryptos in the air channel, all three of which account for a maximum of five minutes of screen time, this movie and drilling. By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here for much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
