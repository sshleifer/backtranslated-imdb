C'mon guys some previous reviewers have almost written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, it was completely limited to audio phases. <br /> <br /> This use of an outdoor location (and babe) provides proper depth and an almost film quality for a very common episode of this now dated and very well-known exhibition. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few notable exceptions, "The city at the edge of eternity", "Allocation Earth" and "Morning is yesterday". The old series Star Trek must be seriously mothballed and put out of it's boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 are a pretty bad average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the dull things that Gene Roddenberry produced back then, in fact, unlike the popular beliefs that some people worshiped the earth, he went on, he actually made a lot of garbage! He does not deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the corporate bridge set from a modern point of view. They used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic back and cheap cardboard over dashboards. You can clearly see the folders in the paper! Every expense sparing or what!
