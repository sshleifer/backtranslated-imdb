No word can describe my incredible hatred for this terrible transfer of the BTK killer. Rate this movie one in ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a movie. From start to finish there was no single highlight. It was all terribly put together; The script, the action, the plot, the lighting, the direction, the FACT, the actual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-incredibly fun, for the terrible way the whole thing is put together. This review may seem like an unfair and attacked attack on a low budget movie, but that is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I just watched makes my blood boil. How this movie was ever granted rights to production, I will never know. I'm almost tempted to actually recommend BTK because it's really a stand-out as to how pathetic and disturbing it is. I can honestly say it's the WORST in all my movie years. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted over an hour in my life at this useless garbage and would have liked to jump out of the nearest building in advance, had I known what I was inside. ZERO out of TEN.
