Unfortunately, unclear, unclear comedy that apparently spoofs the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" movie, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any spoof that's worse than its goal is doomed to fail ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of hearing the aliens' screaming voices, you will beg for peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
