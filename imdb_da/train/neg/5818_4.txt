--- What happened to these unlikely people. Alan Arkin was as usual unfunny and just goes through the role. The kids are all a mess. Mariesa Tomei probably wants this role to never come to her. And what does Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno do in this really bad, medieval movie? If you enjoy watching losers turn into their malfunctions and not trying in any way to do better, this is your movie. Everyone else, take a trip, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
