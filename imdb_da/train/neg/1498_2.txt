Adjustments for what happened to his movie with regard to distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists making script rewrites aside, let's just take this movie as it is offered, without further explanation. <br /> <br /> God is horrible for this movie. Right on craptastic. Instead of rehashing what can act as a plot, I run a highlighting roll with some curious points that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> A class (out of 5) takes a field trip to a history class to the middle of the friggin 'nowhere in Ireland. These students can be Canadian or American, it's hard to tell. The fact that it was filmed in a Canadian forest instead of Ireland is also obvious. A student does not seem to know anything about the story and is basically the "stupid jock" character from a series of kick ass 80s movies, except when channeling Randy from Scream. One sign can be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a boyfriend who is likely to be killed, but it is never really established if it is true. A sign is the sole and removed from his peers ... just ... cuz ... and then there is a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is obviously the same age or younger than the rest of the casting, is called "sir" more than once. He is very vicious and has a knit cap. His cousin is a rough pornstar with the worst Irish accent to be movie in my lifetime and probably over. Picturesque Ireland has many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks that appear more than once in rocky scenes. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers got a discount on the volume of false posts. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Unknown to me has terribly inbred freaker access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there is a kind of outdoor shop nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working in the register. <br /> <br /> Also unknown to me, if you grow for about 600 years, as history makes us believe, happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, yet amazingly scattered and quite strong. Genetics is a wonderful game of craps. <br /> <br /> There may or may not be more than one freak in this movie. Reference is made to "them" and we see shadows, but only an unhappy guy is ever seen. And when a strange looking guy is finally killed, apparently all dangers have been passed. I run with my first assumption that no one thought to equip another man in full makeup, so they just used one. That's how it looks on the screen. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Also for notes, except for the shiny new knives, the inbred freaks have access to some nice leather equipment, which Richard Greco has tied up, is freshly ready for the next sucker who gets bound ... who also escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to just regret them, so you wonder why they even interfere with tying someone up. <br /> <br /> A dead body in a shack gets maggot-ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours gone. Said dead body will also wear glasses as no signs carry them. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears back from the scene for no reason, chats for 2 minutes, the scene disappears. In the midst of a huge forest. It's not unusual, as Gary can also jump out of nowhere, which is also known as what is found in TV countries outside the screen. <br /> <br /> Ms. Unfortunately Jameson dies and somehow her clothes disappear like my hope that this movie wouldn't suck the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special nod to the "Breeder" character, the poor girl who has been used by freaks for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow and feelings on the camera with all the passion and conviction of a filled chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie was clearly tackled by a drunk or a person with a severe mental disability who has been cultivated and encouraged over the years to suffer from excessive gasoline. It was apparently not just random crap I found on the movie network late at night, apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through its production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God be merciful to all of us.
