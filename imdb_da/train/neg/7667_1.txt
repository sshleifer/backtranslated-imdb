The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of disgust or disgust." If anyone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, let me know because this is the best I can come up with. However, I do not feel that at least it describes how truly horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with two of my roommates. One has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action / adventure flick guru. This last guy does not care about the size of the plot holes as long as the film contains lots of explosions, he will go away satisfied. <br /> <br /> That said, we entered the theater for the Friday show of the Alene in the Dark. To my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why it was the same. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene in a movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is told. Still, I understand why it was told. The director must have understood that only illiterate people themselves would have the idea of ​​paying to watch this movie. Nevertheless, this first scene is the longest scrolling text in the history of the cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems that in the same order we hear about completely separate films. One is about an old civilization and its manipulation with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his attempt at orphans. If you read this and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then start the horrible story, acting, effects and camera work. Tara Reid is horrible as an actress. She does nothing for even in a second makes you believe she is a museum manager. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The reason is probably the worst ever created by man. The whole time itself and roommate with similar tastes ask questions like: What is this? And what's going on there? Apart from this rolling waste we have a couple of narrated sequences of Slater itself. Are they good? NONE. Do they explain anything? NONE. Do we at any time as the audience have the slightest impression on why we should break our minds about what is happening? Once again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but in no time do they seem to like themselves. But then BAM ... sex scene. Once again I do not know. <br /> <br /> Well, I don't know, 30 seconds after the terrible scene ends, we have a war field of 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. This is put on a heavy metal track and causes more brain haemorrhage than ever thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that wasn't enough ... <br /> <br /> There's no head villain. There is the scientist and there are "foreign" things. At one point, the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill that orders them to attack the military post. Why? How did he become the chief commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Slater and Reid in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Have the alien things gone through? Did the military tell them? Who knows ... and at this point who cares? I didn't, and you don't. <br /> <br /> But on top of that, Slater and Reid are attacked by a strange thing. Although it was said that foreign objects will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's in the middle of the * &% $ ing day, and it's bright as it can be. Maybe the strange thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I don't know, and I don't care. <br /> <br /> Now after the movie ended, I ran outside the theater, all 6 feet 6 inches away from me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to watch this movie. Even my gung-ho action / adventure room roommate (who would consider a movie that only cuts and inserts 2 hours of explosion in 1 movie to be the biggest thing ever created) admitted that plot holes were very evident in this movie. <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST I give it a 0.0 / 10 and would give it lower if I could. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly the worst movie ever made. I wouldn't want this movie on my worst enemy.
