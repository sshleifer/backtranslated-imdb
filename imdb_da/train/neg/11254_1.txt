"Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow" (an amazing incovenient title) is simply a bad movie; It has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special about it. Yes, CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus. In addition, the film uses music in the same way as for example. "Gilligan's Island" or the Scooby-Doo cartoons - it never goes. Terrible, simply terrible. There are also no new ideas, just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc, Of bits taken from older movies and series. There is no gatekeeper here, the movie just seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining at all.
