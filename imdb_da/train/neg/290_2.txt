Killer Tomatoes movie has this special kind of humor - you love it or hate it. I like it, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone. The tomatoes are not the same, jokes are paralyzed, even the actors are not so funny. Because that's the only thing this kind of movie should be - fun. <br /> <br /> So now the plot made to laugh is annoying. They really shouldn't have done the fourth part to the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
