I watched this movie as I liked the plot, a group of strangers held captive and trying to figure out how they are connected. <br /> <br /> The setting and assumption were obviously influenced by the first (and best) case movie and although there wasn't much action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. There was the comedy relief ion form of the two bickering 'Alpha Males' and it was a welcome surprise (for me anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart not giving up acting yet. <br /> <br /> A few things let me down personally; 1. The pedophile was far above characterized, so he was lit by everything from children to dead bodies. <br /> <br /> 2. The MJH line on her policeman, for example, getting her into this when he was in fact the least deserved person to be there, had not deliberately contributed to the events that led to their catch. <br /> <br /> 3. The end ..... what kind of movie ends right in the middle of something going on? There was no solution, no sound clip, no obvious end ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> For that alone, I dropped two stars out of my rating. The first 2 points I would let slip but not the end!
