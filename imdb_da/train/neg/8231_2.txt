May contain SPOILERS ... BUT DOUBLE IT MAY REALLY BE SPOLED !!. <br /> <br /> Five over the eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This movie is trying to be different from most "Blair Witch" movies. It doesn't work .... it just ends up looking and feeling like someone had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist gets no real motivation (and resembles a lesbian wearing a power dress over the five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... just the sound of screaming and crushing. The whole movie takes place inside a van, which means that decent scenery is out of the question. The five girls do best for what they have got, but at least they come across as pretty horrible actresses ... although with the material provided, it's hard to judge whether they can actually ... ... Using the whole movie screaming, screaming and whining ... so much so that half of the time is hard to decide what was said and the cameras are so bad, it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video paints itself as a violent torture movie, but in reality only five girls in a van are screaming in terror ... which literally sums up the whole movie ..... we then come to the end of what looks like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls still live ... with a minus one finger. The only thumbs up (get it ... finger .... LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after making this horrible movie. Do not judge this by the poster .... you will be very disappointed.
