I regret every second of the time I lost while looking at this movie really. Unfortunately, I always find it hard to turn off a movie when I started watching it. Especially when it is such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think this is one of the movies every movie lover should have seen at least once, so that's why I saw it. Don't make me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a great fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, nor a spy girl or a romantic love story. Well, not even a compelling mix of both of these genres. The only thing that caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would remain together at the end or part of each other. I think "having and having not" is very overstated, and Bogart was in much better movies during the 1940s.
