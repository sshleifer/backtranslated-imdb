I think the Micheal Ironsides actress career should be over if he has to star in this kind of low-budget crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time in this nonsense. <br /> <br /> This movie could be much better if it had a good budget, but it shows repeatedly throughout the movie. There is a scene on an outpost that looks like it outside a railway station and I knew it was. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that made this movie a 3, and it shows the Spacecraft lands and goes over a lake surrounded by forests. It was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene that looks like an engineering factory that I bet on it and does not look like an intermediate post as the sign says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a seriously low budget, makes no sense and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
