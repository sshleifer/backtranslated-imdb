For a comic writer, Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer down with this little attempt at character development. There are a few entertaining moments, but no more than one would have listened to their dryer tennis balls. Will Ferrell waste his time in this movie that doesn't show its usual fun delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again he had no room to move in this otherwise lying movie. The film is so heavy and boring that it can't carry, but if it was worn, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that continue and continue in a scene and don't really do anything, but to show that their writer can write a few lines of cunning dialogue at times, then you will love this movie.
