A handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments. I do not want to argue with their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I first watched this movie, I was mildly impressed. But after comparing it to other movies, especially with the late gentleman, Bruce Lee quickly changed me. In fact, if it wasn't for the title of the movie, I'd never have bought it. Game of Death 2 does not relate to the original Game of Death (except it shares a character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was stunned to see how similar Game of Death 2 was compared to Enter the Draw on. The ceilings have striking similarities: Both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two places are alike, where they are both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent two guest rooms in both films.) Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's craftsman lack a hand. Their is an underground drug trafficking in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in the Game of Death 2. He has a pet in Enter the Dragon, the director has used his imagination and assigned Lewis with a pet monkey! The list goes on. <br /> <br /> As for other aspects of the film, like the manuscript and the play, I felt it was very poor. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the movie and asked for them to act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I cannot deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the fighting sequences have strong elements in acrobatics in them, they are nevertheless skillfully executed. But as the plot is insufficient, I could not relate to the characters, therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibits than having an impact on the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is advisable for any martial arts fan, but for those who enjoy a solid action movie, with a good story and strong characters, I would not seriously recommend this movie. My opinions on this movie may seem very tense and unilateral, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts movie, especially after his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film failed to rise to these standards. About something they imitated a truly brilliant martial arts movie, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> Following on from my assessment that giving this movie a very tough one out of 10, the movie is buildable and must be grateful that it had the fighting sequences it did.
