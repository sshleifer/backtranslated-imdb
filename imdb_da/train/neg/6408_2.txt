The films from the UPA are surprisingly well-judged on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM on their prime. Unfortunately, due to the increasing cost of making beautiful cartoons with high frames and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the files were scanty to make, and they had made several Oscars "prove" that the drawings were now mainstream. So as a result, miserable animation was becoming the norm, and this trend was not returned to the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the early ones. The characters are very simply drawn (somewhat simpler and they would have used stick figures), and backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with colors added in a very flap-dash way (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items). <br /> <br /> With regard to history, it is a jive story with a strong jazz style setting. Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. It is the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story and because of the shootings and everything is probably not a good movie for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, is not a very good movie for me either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I'm a crank (which I am to a degree). However, I love animated movies, and a bit of this minimalist UPA style goes a very, very long way, and you can't seriously consider them great works of art - just very quickly made cartoons. Ignore the Oscar's and try to see some classic cartoons or something - something else!
