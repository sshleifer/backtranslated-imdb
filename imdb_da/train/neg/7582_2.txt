High heels are tricksy things. They can raise women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, make a crisp style, and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a dangerous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedies. Tacones lejanos are more of a disappointment than a stylish high rise. Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is stylish, but in terms of plot it is a heavy and boring affair full of confusing, complicated characters that never fully engage or make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos is just not interesting. The best bit comes in the beginning in a wonderful macabre case of death strokes orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant piece of black comedy, things look up, but then the film comes to a heel. There are solid enough actors and there are some stylish, artificial directions to expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, broken mother-daughter relationship and a character alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police officer, this could have been a melodramatic power plant. Instead, it is poor. High heels stumble safely.
