I didn't know if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a Hitchcock rip off or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute. In those days, someone would have chopped it a little and presented it as one of those television anthropy episodes from the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after a comprehensive rewrite. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is, there seems to be a nice, creepy little story trying to get out from under the rubble in this movie, and the actors do the best they can with both their talent and that material to work with. But the director did not know how to stage or pace in a dramatic scene; the special effects simply did not work; the manuscript telegraphed its sharp plot points so clearly that a bivalve could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack continued to play German "oompah band" music, as it was trying to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried really hard. But it is only interesting as a period. I suppose a very young kid who hadn't seen a lot of excitement or horror could get paid "The Screaming Skull", but a person who would most likely not get most of the subtitle or plot motivation. ("Mommy, why is that nice man trying to scare the angry scaredy cat?")
