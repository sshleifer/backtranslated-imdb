Amazing. You will say that if you sat through this movie. Simply, amazingly amazing. In fact, it's so amazing that someone was stupid enough to dump money to do this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you see. It's my friends who are really scary about this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to do it. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazing original story: High school student (occasionally appeared as college go figure) has been listening to a mother, living in a trailer park, and is an "artist" that's ridiculous for his "is everything else." Well of course, this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed, and here is the original part, his soul is in a scarecrow (during which he is killed by his sluty mama's newest john). Then he goes around with the normal killing of all the people who have hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - Fantastic fun movie ?? Although not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted. <br /> <br /> - This and the successor of a disk in Wal-Mart $ 5.00 bin ?? so it's just a little overpriced. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt it, Didn't help: <br /> <br /> - The violence and gore is kind of sub-standard. One person is stabbed with a corncob. <br /> <br /> --Sound as if they put a lot of effort into the music, but it does not fit very well with the movie, and it is not so good. /> The bad: - Awful, horrible acting. <br /> <br /> - Another slasher easy-down with sexy women? None of them remove clothes. When did it end up being a staple with low knot knives? <br /> <br /> - Nice story. <br /> <br /> - The bird fighters throw up one-liners that would blush Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger. - The underlying love story never goes and is badly done. <br /> <br /> - Some of the killed people seem to be randomly chosen? You never really know who is, and then they are killed. And you just assume they must have got it. <br /> <br /> The ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average slasher fare, just with a murdered scarecrow instead of ?? Well, all the other crap. - Not as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series, all of which are better than this cruelty. <br /> <br /> - The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. Scripture is loaded with a level of retardedness that I never thought could exist. I'm serious here? It is a full step beyond terrible. Don't make me wrong, even though it's fun as hell ?? but i have never heard more asinine banter ?? even in "Slumber Party Massacre III." This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes scarecrow: Worst gem ever. Dialogue to match. Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - The one where primary school youths spit their own female dialogue: "Hey, let's go find small animals to torture. Huh huh." Acting: 3/10 Story: 3 / 10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No nudity, mother is a whore, girls wear no bra) Violence / Gore : 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, overtly, over-the-top and painful fun, so bad is it good. My first review for any movie in any movie!) Music: 5 / 10 Direction: 2/10 Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> All in all: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another for just people like me enjoying to look clean shed. Or Slasher movie performers. This is not a good movie at all. Laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
