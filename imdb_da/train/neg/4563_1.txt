This movie is possibly the cheapest, cheesiest and poorest sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> However, it is the funniest and most idiotic movie from Disney, and will guarantee laughter to the juicy stories and lame plots from the beginning to the finish. <br /> <br /> It is a group of short stories that seem like bad fan fictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first is about Beast and Belle, who are petty over a pathetic argument. Then, three losing new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle. Partly through this little episode, Belle has wall hangers that made my siblings and I laugh so hard. Then she and the animal fight more over the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Surely old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> The next thing about Lumiere is being the world's largest dope when it comes to romance. This comes from the man who could woo something female. And they make the FiFi a psychotic villain that tries to kill Belle and wins out freeing without being able to escape at the end of it. What is a message to send the kids! <br /> <br /> Next, Mrs Potts is anxious. And the next one is all about Beast being too possessed by a bird, to the point where he just seems silly. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 errors you can clearly see ... and the color is horrible. Belle is a simmering juice that blubbers when something goes wrong. Plus, she is small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side signs are annoying ... (I think Cogsworth and Lumiere are struggling almost all the time. I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated in that.) <br /> But the worst thing is Mrs. Potts. She's destroyed in this. I can't even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1/10 to sap, but I'm giving it a 10/10 for comedy.
