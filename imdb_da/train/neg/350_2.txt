The performances from Fishbourne (which is strangely fun) and (briefly featured) Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connerys, who do not seem to find meaning in his role and end in an 80-year-old motorcycle's motor behavior. In fact, you do not make sense to imagine a 60 min. happy ending plot plus a sudden swing appendix without any argumental structure in relation to the signs. It is more an accident than a manuscript and can be a good exam at screen-wrighter's schools. The more you recall the details, the stronger you get this impression. The death penalty is not a problem here, although it is an issue from the beginning; it disappears without further comment. The subject and the environment could have been good.
