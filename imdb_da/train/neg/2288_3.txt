Who is Bettie Page? I certainly haven't figured out while watching this movie. From what I've gathered from other sources, Ms Page was highly sought after in the post-war II period as the queen of "naughty" pictures, and that's exactly what this movie portrays. I never understood Bettie, the woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life only suggested. The film shines over its personal life and comes right down to the purpose of the movie, the "naughty" pictures. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames, but there is the frame of Bettie in her pointy bra, Bettie in her belt and socks, Bettie in bondage ... etc. The movie slides from black and white to color each Once Ms visit Miami Beach. Then back to her shades of gray life in New York, we go. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet. When Bettie tells a friend that she was missing her high school valedictory by getting an A rather than an A, one can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how picturesque Ms. Page's "naughty" pictures look like in 2007. It is really sad to see a woman who is cheated as a pig on a spit, would not even get a hit on My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was badly written or if a crazy editor edited the case. I would only recommend it as a source of people studying the history of odd underwear.
