2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a not so decent rip-off of the Hostel. Live Feed follows virtually the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film, except this time, the stupid children in Asia are rather than Central Europe. The ground focuses on these stupid children, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in a theater and kill them. Although I had heard some less-than-favorable things about this movie before I saw it, I still hoped it might be at least half-decent because Director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent 45-minute rape and revenge movie 'Torched' But this movie simply falls because most are either ridiculous or boring. Of course, the film tries to get back to the good old days of Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did successfully), but it doesn't really come out. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work with special effects - not even gore is impressive ... though much better than the actor! There's not much else I can say about this movie ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
