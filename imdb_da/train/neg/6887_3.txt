Yet another "son who won't grow up" flick and just the other recent ones as entrances. Honor another poor wig that channels Napoleon for what, third time? Anna Faris is forgettable as always; Jeff Daniels called this into another state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... how do you become typecast so late in a career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here that has not been covered many times. I want to say It is about a hundred times better than "lack of launch". There are very few entertaining bits in the movie unless you think Eli Wallach's curse is fun. Ha, Ha! He is old and he fell f-bomb! Tea, hee, hey. Pathetic!
