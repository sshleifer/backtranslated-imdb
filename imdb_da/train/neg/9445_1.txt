Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was shocked. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take the kids to watch this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they will be bored and disappointed. Certain * we all * have read Theos wonderful children's book and we have definite expectations ... but it is clean trash can. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and would never have given his "thumbs up" by such a bad attempt to exploit a classic. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Use your money in the book. If you own a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth the "free" ticket show. <br /> <br /> Stick with the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual image - save your money ... seriously. SAVE YOUR MONEY - it will be on cable of saint patty's day. <br /> <br /> Shame shame on what they do !!
