1e watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a couple more kisses. It seems that the girls are getting pretty tired of these things and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever choose to split and go on their own. In this episode of their adventure, they are trainees in Rome for a "fashion" designer who puts them right into the mailbox to learn what is working hard is about (I guess ..). Apart from the typical flirtations with boys, there is nothing but the Rome scenario, until approx. I Into the film when it is finally revealed why they are fired, then reused, then fired again and then reused. This is certainly made by people who do not understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if there is one.). Even my children did not seem to care about this boring "adventure" in make-believe. Let's see they probably only have a few years for their legal adults. We see what happens.
