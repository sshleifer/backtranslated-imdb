The original "Vanishing Point" was a good flick. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed genuine and spontaneous. Remake was terrible. Preachy, overtly obvious; it missed why the original was a classic. The black charger was cool, but even that couldn't save this flick. Why stick with a white Challenger? I didn't think it was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the movie were inadvertently hilarious. Like when Vigo stood on a rock overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian friend stood beside him. Vigo only had his white panties. I'm sorry - it just looked silly - he examined vista in his fruit of the tissues. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash in the bulldozers - informed the advertiser that the effect was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the police said his remains were not found because he evaporated, but some people think he was bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows him that he rolls out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car will not continue traveling in a straight line for 100 yds. with no one to control it. It would immediately roll over approx. 30 times. Third, if you hit the pavement at 180 km / h, you will open up in various pieces. No matter we see him in the end standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that would offend everyone's intelligence.
