I look over our DVD tower last night to see something. We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled out one that I have never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket it sounded like a rip-off of "The Big Chill", but with the all-star cast, it might feel worth seeing. Boy was I wrong !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill", it was a rip-off almost character for character. The Bill Paxton character was a copy of William Hurt ("where have you been this whole time" role) spoiler warning - and see, he's still left to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc. etc. I found myself wondering why I see these people myself. There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" even find these signs after 20 years? Plus it wasn't even fun unless Perkins fell, celebrated the "flop" out of bed the first morning, it was a sign, and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife: "Were there any nice signs in this movie? ... are you sleeping over there?" She replied, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, no one I can think of."
