If you want to see a delayed gay Karate expert, try a lot of trying to try hard wannabe Mexican gangsters repeatedly in a hr, then this is the movie for you. If not, then select another DVD from 20c bin, which is the only place this movie belongs to. The action was so horrible that I had to force myself to see it at the end. The tire makes it so cold, but it's just another cheap, b grade gangster movie like 2 g and a key, bloody streetz and threat. I wouldn't buy or rent this movie unless you plan to get stoned and plot, edit, and really don't do anything for you. It is truly the worst movie in the history of humanity !!!
