I can summarize this movie with 20 words or less. Too predictable for a story line with the potential to be fun, but instead fall flat on the face. See 19 words, but I didn't quite do this flick with just one star, but instead I decided to bump it up to two stars because of the fact that Julie Bowen smokes hot and just enough eye to prevent me from rip the DVD straight out of the machine and blow it up with an M80. My advice, take the $ 4.00 rental fee you would have paid to watch this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you time and frustration for having to sit through this train wreck or you can Send me $ 50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking your twelve gage to use this piece of waste as skeet shooting practice.
