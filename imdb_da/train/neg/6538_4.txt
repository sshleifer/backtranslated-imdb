Reading my review of the house that is scratching can many assume that I am a 14-year-old who believes that SCREAM is considered "classic" horror. This is not the case as I am 30 years old and have seen horror movies for most of my life. But of course I am a child in the 80s who grew up on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal etc ... types of horror movies - so I typically prefer horror movies that are more graphic and faster. Like someone who can appreciate different music, paintings or in this case movies - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people can enjoy this kind of movie ... I just don't ... <br /> <br /> HOUSE SCREAMED is a very boring and boring movie about a school for friendly girls. The heavy-handed mistress in school rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young son crawling around looking at the girls while they shower (in their nightwear no less (?!?) ...), and in the meantime girls disappear from school as they are the victims of a murderer who are lurking about the campus ... I can see why the HOUSE, as scared, is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a movie in my opinion ...) as to the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - But this movie is so boring and unintentional that I could hardly stay awake. I'm too "excitement" and "excitement" in horror movies - but this movie was neither for me. Fortunately, I don't expect a lot to go into this, so I can't say I was really disappointed - HOUSE SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally didn't enjoy most horror movies much older than the 70's. This is not a hard and fast rule, but those I have had seem to be more the exception. Probably a "must-see" for horror fans who enjoy more subtle and suggestive horror movies - but as I don't really know too many fans of that kind of material, I really can't recommend this ... 4/10
