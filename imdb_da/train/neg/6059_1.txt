I must say to be the fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best movie. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I cannot logically believe he has made any effort whatsoever in this regard as he did with cigarette burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You should look at this from the point of view that it didn't look like a movie. It looked like someone else directed it to one thing. I don't think Carpenter has done anything for it at all. <br /> <br /> I just listened to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack, and it was great, especially for the times. <Br /> <br /> He used a style that no one had, and it worked so well for his movie.
