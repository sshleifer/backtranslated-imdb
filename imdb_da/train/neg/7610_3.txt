In general, I don't like movies directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is one of an exception) and I have never been a Robert Redford fan either. Still, I thought "Three Days of Condor" should be good because of the number of praises it received. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye, and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the eerie professional killer, I found the whole thing extremely disappointing. The film exudes incredible paranoid atmosphere, but everything is destroyed by the immersive plot that doesn't seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The movie also features one of the most unsatisfactory conclusions I have ever seen that really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can you say about the absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I'd much rather see some of Hitchcock's movies five times in a row than sitting through this garbage again.
