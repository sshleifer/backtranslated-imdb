This is a horrible movie and not a scene has an ounce of truthful feelings. The characters are uninflected, obviously drawn, predictable and the story is obvious and typically Hollywood wants fulfillment. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this movie was made, but he plays someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 and became the script to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found alongside the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. The character of the team - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this movie (not) by chance - is placed with obvious squares of the 60's pre-hippie cool: bachelor pad, the swinging hi-fi lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously fuzzy, a tantalizing slap of old fogies who desperately want the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon to find them and their big honk cars cars sexy. Ugh. The youth culture was never so desperate. And I shake to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for young that he took this embarrassing part.
