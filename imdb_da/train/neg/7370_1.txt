I've seen many Seagal movies, and while most aren't big or even good, this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies. The plot: That's not right. Something about a substance that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to tell Most of the movie is cropped scenes that go back and forth between people in darkly lit spaces complaining of how good the Seagals character "Mashall" is. <br/> <br /> Works: Blower. <br /> <br /> Voice Dubbing ,,,,,, What was with the horrible voice overdubbing?! Could they find someone who sounded less like Seagal? Maybe Cheech or Chong also had voice overs, maybe at least entertaining then. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and totally silly. Avoid it at all costs !!!!
