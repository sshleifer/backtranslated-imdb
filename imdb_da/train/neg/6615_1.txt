Once in Indian film comes a film like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And it only once (hopefully) we have an RGV ki Aag that breaks all standards and creates one of its own. A standard so low it can never be broken. Ram Gopal's hot manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a bowl so you can smell it from a distance. Taking a classic like Sholay and the murder is completely unforgivable, and I can't believe he almost called the movie RGV k in Sholay. Although Sholay had many folklore elements in it, the film managed to build on its plot simply by defining the characters so clearly that they lived forever. What Aag does is take those characters and mess them so badly, you need a competition to choose the worst. The realism element is completely lacking and what the film ends up giving is a bunch of "actors" parading together in a plot of smaller and seemingly independent set of events. A star for this movie is a ridiculous waste of a voice. It is time for the RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and make another "different" plot that can be categorized under cinema.
