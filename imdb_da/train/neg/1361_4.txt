I was thrilled to discover this late sixty comedy staring at some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and of course Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was thus made to discover that the film does not seem like a comedy or a perfect movie. Ustinov plays a tiny villain just outside the prison, which places his place on a large American company based in London. Bluffing his way past the Dedicated Managing Director Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, Ustinov passes as a computer expert and immediately plans the "perfect heist" part of the movie. To do this, he needs to get past a tamper protection system that protects the company's mainframe. And here's the problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the movie is remarkably confident and stupid. His lame excuses are taken at face value, and this must be the only computer center anywhere, not disturbing camcorders. The second problem is heist (fraud really) happening within the first 30 minutes of the movie robbing the rest of the picture of much by virtue of dramatic excitement. Unfortunately, Maggie Smith is miscast as Ustinov's ditsy neighbor / neighbor / secretary who just can't hold a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she just seems together here, also composed, that part called more of a crazy, physical comedian. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, perhaps it is the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, which lacks the actual romance as it is, still comes a little crooked. Ustinov co-wrote the script and it was thought well at that time, but I found it unfunny, meandering and a sad relax of a great cast.
