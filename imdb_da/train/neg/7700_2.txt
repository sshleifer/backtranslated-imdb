I watched the movie yesterday at home, but I thought it was too long first and foremost. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too out of text to have in this, what I thought was a comedy-type movie like the rest before. Things are not fun in the movie: fiance hits his girlfriend, blow. The movie was too long - talking about wanting to sleep and asking when it will end when you wake up and still play it! Some of the things about reunion were too much to catch - like lady singing - I felt like I was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry, you can do better then here!
