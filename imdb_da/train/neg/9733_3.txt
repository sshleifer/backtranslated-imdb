Really bad Firestarter clone that seems more like a bad movie than a bad movie. How disappointing for this to come from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Public entrepreneurs do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy born to the couple from the experiment runs a constant fever of 100 degrees, and when he is grown, people in his life begin spontaneously to burn. He's trying to figure out why. <br /> <br /> The people who are completely on fire are well done, but when they come to the point that they are well done in a different sense, they are of course changed to dummies. When fires shoot out of the character's arms, it looks stupid than alarming as it should. Also ridiculous is the fire that apparently travels through telephone lines and bursts of large rays from the receiver's earpiece. How should that happen, exactly? <br /> <br /> Another thing that struck me so silly about the movie is when a character has visions from his parents. We later see exactly the same images from these visions in home videos.
