What this movie does not answer is how wrong this war is (and most American wars have only recently been made to get some oil). How many innocent civilian accidents have there been, how many people lost and how overtly stupid perpetrators are. <br /> <br /> So let me ask you - if American soldier kills women and children other than enemy, it's okay, but if the government accidentally kills their own forces of deadly chemicals while killing many civilians like Well , it is not? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
