After Harry Reems' teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reem's despondent becomes consolidated by having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries a stick and dress as a magician, has raped more women. Finally, Reems decides to track him and end his crime. Despite being shot on film and marginally unpleasant, it resembles any other 70's porn and is inappropriately executed. The weapon and abuse scene is surprisingly detained, and the attempt to redeem "Death Wish" is ridiculous. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") plays a policeman. Colt, which is usually over-the-top, wigs in a couple of scenes, but he is too well behaved by my money. This roughie could have been much rougher.
