I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I guess seeing him on the screen makes me feel that anyone working hard can succeed regardless of talent. It is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other reviews point out how stupid the detention is, but many fail to point to positive ones. <br /> <br /> Any movie where at least one annoying teenager is killed cannot be too bad. Why should so many movies that have a cast teen always include the stereotypical teenagers? Are there no other teenagers? Does each group of teenagers have an angry black guy? A genius that no one likes? A dull girl who is very kind and (in this movie) pregnant? A disturbed anti-social white child from a broken home that everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?). And a casual black child who is in harmony with the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic children trust him. Then add a few generic consumption-free teens of any color. They don't say much, but are shot at some point. <br /> <br /> Retention would have been better if the evil guys had blown up the school. Preferably with the authors inside. The dialogue is poor and the plot is worse. When the bad (and the girl) finally hijack a van with fabrics, they sit inside the van. They drive the van to school because they want to remodel the van in the school's painting shop, but they never go around to measure the van. By the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or truck and drive away without painting the police repetition. They also do not move drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide to kill the kids and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren), although when the villain takes over the school, no one is remotely aware of it because it is after school. The handful of people still in school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why go after them? <br /> <br /> In any case, the best part of this movie is that the bad guys are all armed with many machine guns, and they keep finding teens (including a guy in a wheelchair) and they continue to shoot hundreds of bullets on teens and usually miss. At the end of the movie there is some bloodshed. For every time someone is shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired, missing. The stunters are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews saying that this movie had a $ 10 million budget and I'm amazed. When I watched the film, I thought maybe, Lundgren had done it as a kind of charity work for some film schools where he is a teacher. As perhaps this film was their end of the year exam. It was a try to see it, but I passed.
