A very cheesy and boring road movie with the intention of being hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles that only result in sleepiness. <br /> <br /> The game is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing that is worth it is the premium Lalo Schifrins soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are completely deserved; It's really clean waste. Of course, this has its charm to watch a movie that everyone would not lose on the glass if it was on fire, but save it for a big day where you absolutely have nothing else to do.
