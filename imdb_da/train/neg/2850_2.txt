If I had realized John Wayne was in this movie, I wouldn't have seen it. It's demeaning to Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing for any thinking person. But then most John Wayne movies are like that. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everyone in the world loved the Americans when the truth was (and still is) something different. The film deals with the nineteenth-century isolationism in Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood to be isolated. To put it as briefly as possible, this movie is frighteningly jingoistic claptrap. (Sort of a Madama Butterfly with bad music.)
