Fragmentary film about a few people in Austria under a heat wave. This kind of movie has been made more often and most of all better. The stories have nothing to do with each other, except for the pathetic finale: 'People are cruel'. Unlucky, unpleasant people and a movie that goes too long without really doing anything ... Ultra-realistic? Hardly ... Drilling? Yes. Not even beautiful Franzisca Weiss can save this! 3.10
