"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the most important players. Not even can they save this completely over the acted melodrama. First and foremost, Hepburn is terribly displeased as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, she can't even pull it out. She is too strong to be credible as being so much of a simpleeton, and was just too old for that. Lancaster over acts to extreme, and Earl Holliman is too hammy and comes out more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the always reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise a little - but even they can only do so much. It seems that the 1950s were once when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit like an actress, and that's fine. She just made a bad choice here. Luckily for her fans (I'm among them) she didn't do too many of them. Despite an A-list cast and good production values, it doesn't work.
