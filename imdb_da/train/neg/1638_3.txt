I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after recently renting "The Whole Nine Yards" - easy to rent, by the way - but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I remembered that the "whip" trailer was something fun and the plot of three overgrown New Yorker thieves somethings all fall to and be manipulated by the charming Ms Peet was worth a shot. So I convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me. This review is my penalty. <br /> <br /> In the first action we have the three lead bolts that tell their conquests in a dining room. What should have been fun, or at least telling, comes out pretty pathetic. Was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their meetings that we should get out of this? <br /> <br /> [And while I don't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar, I wondered why no one in the eatery turned around when the spikes spoke loudly about sexual and cataloging details. They do it every week on the same dining room? You would think someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other diners notice in a scene. But this is just a setup for a punchline. Everybody else in the dinner is deaf.] The other action has the three studs all falling to Mia and then developing brain root, failing to ask each other or her about what really happens between the four of them. And I continued to ask myself, since the tips continue to act as they have been, what redeeming qualities does she see in them to keep them longer than a date? Does she start with cerebral palsy? I was hoping for Eric's character, the married friend, to become something more than just the annoying punch in this action. His role is clearly giving advice on being married. But why do they even interfere with talking to him when they do not want to talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third action solves what is plot, but at this point I looked at my watch. My friends told me that they are still waiting for something really fun to happen, and I agreed. The scene that explains everything was sufficient and managed to explain all the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie, but we just controlled them from a list. ("Oh, okay, therefore, Brad had what happened and Jonathan says this and ...") <br /> <br /> What we laughed was from the plot's stupidity than to something entertaining. Even the exits under the credits were not very fun. In the end, I was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
