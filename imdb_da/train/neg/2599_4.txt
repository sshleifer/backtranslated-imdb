I have the DVD very cheap and I'm a total Drewbie, and that's the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone. <br /> <br /> An early Drew movie, she looks great, and she gets a lot of real cute scenes from her like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, a lot of sexy clothes, etc. She never shows it friendly charm we know from her newer movie. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is pretty average or under-average, and much more like being made for the TV than one for the movie theater. There is no real horror or tension built up, and the dialogues are often cheeses. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly don't understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway. But in any case, you won't get the end you would expect, and it also comes much faster than you would have expected. All in all, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
