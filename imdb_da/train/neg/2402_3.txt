A surprisingly misfire from the normally reliable Larry Cohen (Good Customs Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High tries so hard to be fun and fail, even with decent fluctuations by Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed at all his achievements, and son Adam simply looks like numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.
