This 'movie' must be the biggest pile of steaming C * ^ p I've ever seen, what more can I say than bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. There is nothing to save this 'movie' and I NEVER ask them to talk about making a sequel. If you are thinking of seeing this, then know that the story is that two garbage men are being dragged to save the earth. Films like men in black have been torn to pieces and reassembled to make this 'comedy' but have completely failed. Please avoid this movie (save yourself).
