And that's the only reason I have this DVD. Now I haven't seen the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the info out of it and I here by saying: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was man. But then again the first was put in the future, so maybe this Alex is brand new and the researcher has just happened to make Alex woman this time. Who knows it was at least not addressed in any movie. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby then (or whatever you want, as it was, is in the future) escaping with her mother using a special time vehicle and ending in the 80s Africa. There mothers are killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then the stem is slaughtered by a cyborg from the future, and Alex then runs and hides and eventually kills her cyborg. So there. Terminator is not the only movie being demolished here, Predator gets its fair share too, and I think the first Fly movie, Vincent Price One, will be special nomination to provide a solid base for building your cyborgs head off. <br /> <br /> Let's see what more? Okay, the movie was pretty standard little budget flick, but it had bad special effects for a mid 90's movie. It would have been okay for an 80-inch flick, ever. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen, and the viewer is almost not interested. Nemesis 2 is not the most crappy piece of cinema I have enjoyed (?) Watching, but it comes amazing. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say anything about acting because let's be honest here: Expecting any Oscar worthy performances here? Oh well ... At least I found Sue Price hot on the amazonian warrior way. <br /> <br /> A "real" film rating: 2/10 There are not many benefits to it over all quality. And despite the very basic plot, the film makes very little sense. A camp movie rating: 4/10 I occasionally got rid of the film's purity, so it has little advantage in it.
