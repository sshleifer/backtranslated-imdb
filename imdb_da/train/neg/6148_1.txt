First of all, the film was not really facts at all. I just watched the documentary a few days earlier, and the film was nothing like that. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics, and that is what the film should have been about not a story about a man who was healed and who found love at the end and so on. Also, there are many scenes that were just wrong - the stage where he rode a bike on campus, did not follow it in his early university years. In my opinion, Russell Crowe does not fit this part, as he does not see the intelligent / individualistic type, so he really could not play one. It would have been good if it would have focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the overdramed lovelife. At this level, ABM was for Hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think he was not sour or paranoid, and he was on something because people of that caliber tend to know more than we "less mortal". 5.10
