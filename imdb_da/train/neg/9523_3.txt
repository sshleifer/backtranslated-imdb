The plot of this movie is not strong at all, lots of holes. If you approach it as a car movie, it's not bad, many good cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I'm from the area where this was filmed. I get the most pleasure from looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and see how the city has changed since 89. It's an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems that when making a movie here, everyone will have some relationship with it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen when it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay, I find it interesting how the bow to the draw is all over the city. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud.
