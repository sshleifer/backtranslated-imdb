After Disney's witty live action George of the Jungle, I had great hopes for this flick. Big disappointment. Threadable plot, bad action, poor visual effects. This movie was dependent on lame one-liners, idiotic (and meaningless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in the gadget car thing. I took two young children to see it and they were saddened by their minds. The only grin that was received from this movie was poor standby when it was necessary with a laugh that a guy got it in the groin!
