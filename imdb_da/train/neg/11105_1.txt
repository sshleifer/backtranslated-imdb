It didn't make sense, and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like that ... you don't have to watch it. people cutter or eater what should i say ... it made me sick! Oh God! film is about people we do not know but give birth to people! they have teeth blah blah blah ... is it not so well known? I can bet on what you saw in another movie. The cast was so big, but I think the scenario was really terrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely fantastic ... he's so talented ... in fact, I said horrible, but I think because of horrible scenes ... let me explain it. Have you ever eaten your tongue? but in the movie a person did it! it was really awful ... yet I think movies would be so good without the horrible human eating or cutter scenes ...
