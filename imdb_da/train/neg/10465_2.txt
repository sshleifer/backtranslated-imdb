I really wish I didn't write this review. I'm a Christian, so I waited excitedly to see this movie. It seemed good - a Christian movie with some pretty famous stars and a plot that seemed exciting (not that I myself buy the Bible code - you can make it say something you want. I believe everything in the Bible, though). So I sit on the edge of my seat and enjoy the scientists when the movie comes on and manages to ruin my mood in minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the horrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I would have been torn apart by the people who cheered on the rather clumsy, but in principle, uplifting scenes and hanging on the most obvious and predictable tension scene, I'm sure). However, when the final credits started rolling, I could reflect. There were many parts of the movie I liked - some mostly unexpected plot twists, some effects that were quite special (I don't count the visions. They were poorly finished), and some interesting technical works - falling, putting type of thing. Unfortunately I got the impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could have got a better script. And the music was beyond cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes a little cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue). So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like the people who came out, cried and breathed because of how incredible it was - but I'm not someone who can be appealed by a writer who throws some words over a biblical must and slap a Christian stamp on it. I need a good plot and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most movies, and neither does it. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. And that's the tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It must be out there somewhere ...
