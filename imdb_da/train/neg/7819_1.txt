... It would be the worst movie I had ever seen. Hmmm, OK, maybe tied to Boogeyman then. Horrible, really awful. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and I couldn't meet them! I honestly can't think of a good thing. so here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. THE ACTING 2. PLOT 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. PLOT 5. DIALOGUE and finally ... 6. PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, they made a movie at 2:32 hours and then realized they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman together in a scene and were forced to settle down for 3 minutes or did they actually think no one would feel that the main hero and the villain had less screen time than the superman's son and the hands he kills? !! Was half the budget used to persuade Kevin Spacey to do so? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why don't the doctors ask "What F *** do you want us to do? He's a F *** ing stranger! We don't know jack about his anatomy! "? <br /> <br /> What happened in the 5 years of Superman was gone to make technology go 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where the people who wrote good reviews saw the same movie? <br /> <br /> And finally, why? Just why <br /> <br /> BTW, for those of you wondering how came Superman could lift a whole continent of crypyonite, I think I figured it out ... since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite until he sees something green in the rocks, it's clearly all in his head. Therefore, the continent is just him who suppresses his fear of shining green stones ... either it or the authors are gagged half-thoughts that did not believe it was a pretty obvious mistake.
