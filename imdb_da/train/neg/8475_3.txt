(NOTE: I thought I would be the only one who wrote what I did below, but I see the others here agree. I think it was pretty obvious - this exaggerated the cat's cats. At least here is what I had written :) <br /> <br /> The owners have left on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) all alone and locked in the house. It means no milk, but the cat, for his relief, finds a bunch of tuna. But to his dismay he cannot find the opener. It turns out that the little mouse in the house has it ... and lures the cat with it. This is an average rodent who continues to plague Sylvester with the opening and then pull it off at the last second. Sylvester tries everything to open the tuna, but can't do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story and why they make the sadistic mouse, the "good guy" is beyond me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry's comics, where poor Tom always gets the worst of it, though many times the little mouse starts the conflict!
