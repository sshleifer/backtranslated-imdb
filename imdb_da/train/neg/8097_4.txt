Considered by many critics as one of the greatest stinkers (surely the greatest stink of director Brian De Palma's career). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a sneaky boy whose life breaks when he and his girlfriend Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit and run. His story is written by another alley guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it doesn't cause too much. It is undermined by unimaginably incredible, one-dimensional characters that you will never have the displeasure of meeting in real life. I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but couldn't finish it because it wasn't for my taste), but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the short story, consider This movie is a complete travesty. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many talented actors striving to give a below average movie a fate of quality and failure. What wasted. The problems start by casting the cozy guy Tom Hanks in a role that must clearly be unsympathetic. And Peter Fallow's role in the novel was that of a Brit. Bruce Willis is bad, BADLY miscast in the role. What was the idea there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact and be obliged to deliver a paralyzed, heavy-handed lecture on "decency" after the climax. /> <br /> This movie ends up being an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked the talent collection; for that I will give it four out of ten, but I am sure some people will say that a much better movie could have been made from the source material.
