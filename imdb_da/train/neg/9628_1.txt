This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The DVD was given to me for free with an order I placed online for non-related DVDs. <br /> <br /> No wonder they were given away, no one could share money for this drive. <br /> <how some reviewers can say they found fun beggars believe the person who includes it in the worst five movies ever made it look. <br /> <br /> Where in the world is a talented actor Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is incredible. Mostly toilet humor and badly done in it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid it at all costs.
