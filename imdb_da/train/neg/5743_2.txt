Yes, I know I am one of the few people who yearn to step this movie into the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel this way. In fact, it had been advertised as a zombie film or the like, I liked it. But right now I'm completely speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what to destroy * Let's start with the first big mistake. If I didn't know that the movie is called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version," and if I hadn't seen any sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood, I wouldn't have seen the connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Other bad point: What about Metal? It seems that all young people, but mainly the so-called "vampires", are involved in various kinds of metal, mainly judging by their shirts! Don't forget me, I've been in the more extreme types of music for almost 15 years, but nobody will scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all bands !!!) T-shirts running around pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Please wait. WHAT actors?! You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, okay, the movie is very gory, but what difference does it make? It would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the "briliant" instructor had not chosen to create an ARTICLE vampire topic in this movie. I wanted to see vampires, but was treated to some stupid young children, I would have loved to use my baseball bat. The filmmakers should simply have advertised the film that says "cheap b-grade horror without plot but very gore" !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is blasphemy against the entire vampire concept. And that makes me sick.
