This "documentary" is a testament to talent used for strange purposes. The fact that it is funded by the Venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in order to search for the truth about what really happened in those terrible days in April 2002 in Venezuela, even though we Venezuelans do not know. /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the directors of these things are both by omission and by knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex to easily understand by foreign audiences and they benefit from it. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * show the pro-Chávez protesters shooting on an empty street (what the hell did they do for it?) In a way to say they didn't kill anyone but didn't disturb the pictures we all saw Here, resistance protesters (and a journalist) fall dead or wound on the other side of the "empty" street. They can't explain why the police officer's helicopter was the only one authorized to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers who were over the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, something that would show how inefficient would be security measures to protect the president. A few days after the "coup", the head of the military guard, who was in charge, was asked at the National Assembly (our congress) why they did not act against the snipers and he said "because they were not there to act against the president" is it not a confession? There is so much more that the highest rank military announced that Chavez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because "it is politics" and today is the Interior Minister of the Chávez administration. <br /> <br /> It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this "documentary", made to sell the world a picture of the good old Hugo Chavez who governs The poor and the poor rich opposition who want him at all costs when the truth is that 60-70% of people reject their government and this percentage includes the poor. <br /> <br /> I hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see another version made by a group of Venezuelan people with no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has returned!
