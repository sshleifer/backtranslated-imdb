"Stella", starring Bette Midler in the title role, is an unnoticed tearjerker. Stella Claire, who was built in New York, works nights like barmaid, leaning and dancing in a worker's salon. One night, I come to a dormant medical intern, Stephen Dallas, as Woos Stella, and during their affair impregnates her. She spurns both her marriage victims and abortion, sends him a pack for a lucrative medical career and raises her daughter even in near poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a beautiful, loving young lady. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture but still maintains a durable but caring relationship with her daughter and? .. I'm apt and worse yet, which makes the movie sound a bit interesting. Plays and screenwriting are so over-the-top, you get rid of almost any scene. The top offender is Bette Midler, but close by is John Goodman as his alcoholic mate. Each scene seems more constructed than the previous one right to the final, which is really a hoot. Taken as a dramatic piece, this movie is no more than class D, but as a camp it is scored an unintentional B +. <br /> <br />
