Thanks, Hollywood. Yet another movie classic completely destroyed a cheap, low, power-heavy and superfluous remake. The original Apes Planet was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost exclusively on dialogue, which sounds very boring, but was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> By contrast, this movie seems to have gone away with virtually all of the dialogues. Instead of a fantastic movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour hunting movie. The dialogue is reduced to a minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent, and most of the time it is extremely difficult to find out what is happening. Instead, we get a lot of meaningless scenes, some marginally fun single-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks amazing. The makeup of the monkeys is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are also beautiful. However, this does not differ from the fact that "Apesens Planet (2001)" is a very low and simplified film, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and an almost non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop destroying amazing movies by making them meaningless blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the end didn't do any SENSE WHATSOEVER. <br /> <br /> * out of **** stars, mainly for the images <br /> <br />
