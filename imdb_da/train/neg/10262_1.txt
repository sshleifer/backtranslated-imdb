Now I hit this straight out of curiosity and had to continue to watch - just as you see a car accident ... I appreciate that it is a spear, but it should not stop I criticize the godly bill, action and dialogue. Seriously, this is rated as one of the poorest movies I've seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one in it ... Okay - a couple of criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attacking him so we assume it is a heart attack), the army then launches shells, rockets, bullets at the monster - which were feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not affected by any missile and still lives (2) the army attack from about 100 meters away and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez, these things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and burn into the ceiling; the monster drops the child and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? come on! (4) The monster looks like something out of Power Rangers! (5) There is a scene where the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the child) all look shocked and we get reactions (as the hand to the mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general just goes away, time and again (7) refuses the general to try electricity and would not hear (8) the actor is horrible (9) did I mention the rubberized monster ???? (10) the God-fearing music, non-stop!
