Thanks to some infamous home video distributors who brought in the so-called German independent series, Four For Venice is not only horrible but really terrible. So awful that I dumped it for the extra money store. Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who agreed to have sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule for their profession. Eva and Luis are a couple who live from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly gets Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair behind Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would fly to London to do something related to his work of art, but the fact is that he is flying to Venice with Charlotte for a hovlov holiday. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 children together to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends that both Nick and Eva fall to each other. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. It doesn't just look meaningless, but also dragged. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in several ways, but it ends in no avail. It's either the strangers around him that seem like morons, or they're simply stupid. The comedy also tended to add in unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. While some of the issues that can be resolved with common sense, no one in the mind uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that even the beautiful scenery in Venice fails to attract the reputation of the movies.
