It seems that many people really like this, but I found the infantilizing and reasonably offensive codswallop, hidden from the oblivion of Jane Russell and a few memorable songs, especially the opera (but there is a marked dip in the invention later). I'm not going on with Monroe - she's going to play a stupid blonde that's not that stupid, but she's just stupid. Russell can't quite convince when she claims to have never been in a high school but is otherwise quite wonderful. The men are staggeringly uninteresting, just like the plot. In no way terrible but so rude that God, if this is a classic, helps us all.
