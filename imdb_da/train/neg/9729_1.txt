Seriously, what's this? Hooper made such classic movies as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so he made this god horrible movie, what happened? did he dip into the crack a little too much? This movie is about some guy named Sam who has the ability to put things on fire (Firestarter, someone?) The act was godly, the plot was nonsense, and the special effects were extremely rubbish, they looked like something from 70 ' s. Van Damme should be happy that Derailed is no longer the worst movie ever and what was the end of it? He began to glow blue, turned into a glowing blue blob, sucked out his girlfriends fire, and the movie ended. WHAT WAS IT? HUH? When the movie ended, I hoped the DVD would spontaneously burn me to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE FROM THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> DO NOT TIP, OBEY, you will thank me later.
