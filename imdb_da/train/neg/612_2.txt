A long as B-movie goes, SCARECROW is one of those so bad that it gets incredibly annoying to sit through. A lone losing high school student, who is constantly chosen by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up going into his trailer husked mother who has sex with a full redneck. He then chases the child into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the child's soul was transferred to a scarecrow who then walks around and kills the nonsense that bothers him and teachers. This scarecrow, apart from having a snappy en-liner for each of his victims, can also make Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotten body? Like the two superfluous followers that followed, it's not even worth laughing.
