A bunch of women who can't shop, sit around, talk, smoke. They have another woman in a wheelchair, they hide because they are deformed, and sometimes they kill one to give birth to that person human flesh, which really looks like some bought ham that they dressed up by holding a pair of plastic fingers . We can't see them kill anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered with a blood sheet. I can't eat Spam cover for a sheet anymore because of this. Just the idea of ​​Spam covering a sheet is enough to produce the same narcoleptic fit created by trying to get through this whole movie. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who "chases" them by torturing a guy he attached to a chair is his basement. Why he caught this guy and how he is associated with Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of some "superhuman" guy knocking out. He is blood and strikes through a wall, but whoever he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to look at some boring people, you talk deeply about nothing while you sit and eat ham and smoke, then there are 90 minutes of it, because, except for a scene where a chick holds something in a street corner and it The aforementioned random scenes, absolutely nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot you will see them move some things, including deformed sister as they move to their new apartment. Its one of the few times, they are not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.
