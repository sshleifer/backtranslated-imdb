Justin goes home to live with his rigorous, stubborn police detective, but it seems that Dad has turned upstairs on three temporary occasions, each with bizarre tenants living in them.

Wise, convincing, original, intense, wise, genius ???? !!? I didn't see any of these things. What I saw was an uninteresting, bland, tired, extremely cliched low-budget thriller that was ripe with unclearness and no excitement at least when the killer was telegraphed so quickly into the movie as he gives his monologue / debate / discussion. And where are these humorous laugh-high moments? I never have as much as chuckled, maybe because I was too busy struggling not to be asleep by the movie. <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Sound comments with Director Dave Campfield; Second comment with various contributors as well as isolated music tracks; 4 featurettes (Making of, on set, turning 1 seat to 4, & Inside the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould, and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; bloopers; a music video for 'Addiction'; A trailer for this movie; And trailers for "Shock-o-rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon" and "Millennium Crises"
