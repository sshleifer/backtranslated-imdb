Never watch the movie. <br /> <br /> It is trying to be a spit on the scifi / thriller movie from the 1950s and 1960s, but all it does is make you really want to see one of them and not it. <br /> <br /> It's very slippery. A spoof must have some aspect that has something over par quality for it. This movie has no such aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... just don't look at it.
