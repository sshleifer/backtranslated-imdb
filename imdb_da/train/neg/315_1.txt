Seeing this stink constitutes a cruel and unusal punishment in Sandler's hands. Really a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> Bought the DVD in $ 5.88 bin at Wal Mart. But the thought that echoes in my head is: "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgiving thing about the movie is that the boat does not supply! <br /> Best constructive proposal: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know the show on the SciFi Channel, where a guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unatchable horror flicks (Mystery Science Theater). Immediately, turn a comedy program out and make it work. Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear that viewers may actually begin to follow Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
