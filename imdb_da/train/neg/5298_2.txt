I rented this movie because I looked through the horror movie section for the movies that no one has heard of and could be a possible gem. I saw this and when I am a fan of violence and doing, I got it. It got the rating of the European Championship, which means: Extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was completely meant for violence and everything else I got it. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge and Nudity. The "extreme violence" struck my fancy. The movie ended up being a pretty tame slasher flick. It had one or two gory scenes, but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of gore in a movie isn't everything that counts, doesn't it? You also have a plot. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing special about it. Don't rent it. I speak the truth. I can't imagine how anyone could really enjoy it at the point where they say, "I'll have to rent it again." It was the moment when it kept you going, but I will never see that movie again.
