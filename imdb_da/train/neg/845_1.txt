It's a pity you can't vote zero stars on IMDb because I wouldn't hesitate! In fact, I would go so far as to say that this movie was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie and thought that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it might be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful', yes, Primal Instinct didn't even come close to the good, and I had previously thought there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do this for us? The worst part is, I didn't jump a little forward, I hoped at the end they would reveal that it was a kind of sick joke that they thought it would be fun to make us see such a horrible bad movie. <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Directing - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half star, Graphic design - Half star, DVD menu - Half star. <br /> <br /> But I think it is very important to have seen bad movies so you know what a really bad movie is therefore happy that I saw this movie just because I have a bad movie to put at the bottom of my list.
