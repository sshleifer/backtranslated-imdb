I had never heard of this so found out that it is the man with the lethal lens that I had heard of but not seen. Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and that's not good. It will be a kind of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's just not fun unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It comes across as a flat 70's thriller until the last ten minutes when it jumps to life. There are many, many flat scenes in Whitehouse between the president and his helpers who do not work. It's almost as if the original cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb release storylin and the suicide bombers attacks that I think are meant to be played for laughs but again it's not fun . The location is excellent, but the study conditions look like cheap TV. I couldn't believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Only laugh: Connery throws his wig before he puts on his helmet and jumps out of a plane. It makes Never Say Never again look like genius.
