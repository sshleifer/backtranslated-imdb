I don't think this movie was judged correctly. I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R. I will NOT recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18, no matter where the limit R is. Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I don't know about you, but it's not for little kids to look at. True, it may be the African (?) Indian's traditional "clothing style", but ... I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie recently, but I guess it was okay.
