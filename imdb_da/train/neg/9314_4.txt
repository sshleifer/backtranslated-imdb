Well ... in general, this movie was pretty worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy. I just rented this movie last night when I and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie. This was certainly not what we were looking for, but it met us with humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's fun. And especially the Tracy girl when she is on the table and tells the clown to go away. They show almost no emotion, and it's just so obvious they are acting. And even when the clown looks through the black box paper and grabbed Mark, he didn't even look as though he was scared, even though the clown looked like he grabbed him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you just be JOGGING if you were knocked down? I would be sprinting for my life! (Although someone probably could go out of that clown because he is like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not as great as when the clown cuts off Susan's head in the woods, so when he throws her head into table room with Denise and Tracy when Denise throws her head back. As in the previous guy's comment, the beginning makes no sense, and I can't even see why it was even included in the movie. So what was this movie made in 2003? The music made it sound like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Doesn't even look professional. Half of the time it looks as if the camera can't even stay stable when it is supposed to be. Overall, I must say I enjoyed the movie. I would not recommend it, but if you are trying to find something to scare you, but if you are looking for something to enjoy or have a laugh at, I would definitely recommend it.
