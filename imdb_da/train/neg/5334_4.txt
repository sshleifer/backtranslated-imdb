After a few lean years, 1968 was a beautiful season for Elvis: Not only did he make the celebrated "Comeback" TV Special, but he also became father and star in two quite decent movies too? SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore, I can personally forgive him for the mistake that was gone, JOE, which at best appears an interesting misfire and is not so bad to consider. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing ?? as a drowsy Indian father of Elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has an eye on Mr. Presley too - but you are happy to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talent like Katy Jurado (like Meredith's Mexican wife), the two jones ?? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez, who is particularly entertaining as sarcastic Chief Thundercloud, who is Meredith's stubborn father, still giving his old chiefs clothes in the present! <br /> <br /> While there is a surprising (if not unwelcome given their usual mix) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of all parties where the male Native Americans hit the bottle steadily while his Presley practice womanizing skills behind their backs! As can be expected, the typical 'western' Arizona landscape is a great asset here and sleepy, the snoring tongue is not only a good one but a great plot point. On the other hand, the climatic "destruction of the house episode" is one we have seen too often since and does not work so well here ...
