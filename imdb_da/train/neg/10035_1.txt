Absolutely horrible movie. Utter waste of time. <br /> <br /> Background music is so loud that you can't understand speech. Well if you really listen carefully, no matter what they are talking about, it is actually incomprehensible. Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives headache, action is unclear, dialogues are incomprehensible, action is abysmal and well Kareena used to look like a wrestler, now she looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell you can slim down, but you can't get grace. After spending three hours on a movie, I like it, but this movie wouldn't even give me that pleasure. <br /> <br /> If you want to torture yourself, see it here.
