Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie for TV. I can't believe Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character speaks all the time and says "pussy" when referring to NSync's boyfriend. Morgan Freeman calls women "pussy" is just awkward ... What the hell were the people behind this movie thinking? For many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrendous actions, confusing camera angles, a lame script and inexpensive background music, this movie was absolutely unbearable. I rented this flop with low expectations .... but. .. well ... it really sucked.
