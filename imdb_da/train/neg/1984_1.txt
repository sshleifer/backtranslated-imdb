An absolutely steaming pile of cow manure. It is fun for me that this movie itself was made. Hip-Hop and Old Westerns don't seem to mix. Which audience were these people thinking about when planning this trainwreck. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the play is terrible and the fact that some decent actors themselves were in this nightmare of a movie makes their whole career a laugh. Chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is cut off from any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue, she should have asked which of her friends played this fun joke. After some research I actually found a list of some other actors who went on to this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I would rather watch a blank TV than watch this movie again.
