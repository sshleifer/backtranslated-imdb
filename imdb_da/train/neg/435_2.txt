An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in film. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and some other stuff before the 80s. To explain that he has no idea what is happening in cinemas these days, he throws in The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same lame movie-as-art speech again. This speech is reduced to obsolete psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is garnished with the cheese effect that Zizte has edited in the movies he takes over. For someone who should know a lot about movies, his own cinematic speech is: yeah. <br /> <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words - I saw 5 \ t 7 on the screen, last night, or with the words of a large film producer: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek) What you've just said is one of the most insane idiotic things I've ever heard. At no time in your hiking was inconsistent response yourself close to something that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now stupid for listening to it. I assign you (two) points (only), and may God be merciful to your soul.
