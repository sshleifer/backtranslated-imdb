This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I went in expecting a cheesy movie, but at least with some cool car scenes / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is so low budget that they sped it up to make it look like the cars "go fast" In a scene, a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in just 4 seconds just by spinning around in circles. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To watch a real movie about cars, see the fast and furious series. They may be a bit cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be. Better yet just see Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made I think.
