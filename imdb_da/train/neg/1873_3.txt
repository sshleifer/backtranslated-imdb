You must be kidding!!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress and not just an impression in the actors' quirk of the month club. Really, unless this is supposed to be a heavy-in-cheek satire on David Mamet's stubborn, confusing dialogue delivered alternately in machine gun fast or monotonous (think Ben Stein) mix - or a flat-out dry comedy; This movie has to be running for a Rotten Tomato prize - or worse. As if the stiff and unpleasant Posey wasn't enough, we have the stiffer and even more unpleasant Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. Adding to this already bizarre casting is several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors who watch or sound like an escape from America's next top model, Don Pardo, or even the child who pronounces the word "become" as "prayer" that simply brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this movie, we analyze his accent to guess whether he is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed heartily in places that were to be serious and took serious paragraphs that should be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jan's music for Mamet's "The House of Games". If it is taken as a spoof, the movie is almost dull; If taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of dragon.
