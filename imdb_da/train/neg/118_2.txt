It is said to be a personal movie for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life, but changed things around to fit the people who are detectives. These detectors date beautiful models and have no trouble getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy movie maker than a detective, right? This whole movie was written by Peter, and it shows how he was out of touch with real people. You have to write what you know and he actually did. And leaving the audience bored and confused and jealous, for that matter. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered just after the movie. But Patti Hanson, who really wanted to marry Keith Richards, was also a model like Stratten, but is much better and more abundant. In fact, Strat's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have much to do with the story, which is pretty rebellious at first. All in all, every character in this movie is someone that very few people can relate to unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels on your wine call. For the rest of us it's an annoying string party. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your friends with inside jokes and live the rest.
