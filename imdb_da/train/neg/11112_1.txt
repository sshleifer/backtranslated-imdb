Wow, how bad can it get. This was seriously bad. Not with regard to gore - which was mainly ridiculous CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the arch of the head was a total joke. Within a couple of nights of stalking Vinnie Jones, he begins to be "haunted" to cry when photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers this childish, suggestible and weak? His character development had absolutely no reason or anything at all - and in the end you would laugh aloud at the completely predictable and utterly absurd twist that his character takes. <br /> <br /> The good moments were clearly just a weak, low-self-worthy effort to jump on the modern MTV-style carriage - all cgi, blood and no real feelings at all. These parts were accidentally fun - and distracting from their self-awareness - crazy camera angles, etc. In general, this film is the crime of blowing another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters in the end) are destroyed in favor of 'look at me' style self-conscious directing. This film was not made for and the audience - it was made for a CV - a deep selfish motive.
