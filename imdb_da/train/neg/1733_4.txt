SAPS AT SEA Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> (black and white) <br /> Slightly from 'hornophobia' goes Ollie on a 'leisurely' boat trip, but he and Stan are mixed with a escaped judge (Rychard Cramer). Chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - an OK entry, yet unspools as a simple imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L&H and producer Hal Roach. Episodically structured, the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after Boys are hosted by villain Cramer (who shoots a seagull to prove how hard he is!). Gags are ok, but there is no inspiration, perhaps due to recruitment of actor-director Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for Ollie's first solo effort in the audio age (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz. Fair, but nothing special. L & H regulators Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances.
