Would be significantly enhanced significantly by doing it as a <br /> <br /> 50-minute episode of the outer borders. Too much superfluous material and stuff like the supreme bad guy who looked like he had fled the Opera's Phantom did not help. The entire 'Night of the Living Dead' sequence was extremely stupid and quite unnecessary. After all, if the dead were to punish someone for their sins, now reminds me who killed everyone again?
