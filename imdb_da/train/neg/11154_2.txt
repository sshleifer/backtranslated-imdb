This step was on TV last night. I guess like a filler because it sucked badly! The movie is just an excuse to show some breasts and ass at first and somewhere around halfway. (Not bad breasts and ass myself). But the story is too ridiculous for words. "The wolf", if that's what you can call it, is hardly ever saving his teeth. When it is clearly visible, you can clearly see that they had some trainees working on CGI because the wolf runs as if he is running in a treadmill, and the CGI coat looks like it has grown, all shining :) < The film is full of gore and blood, and you can easily see who will be killed / cut / eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies, you will be disappointed they didn't do a good job on it. <br /> <br /> Don't even get me started on the actors ... Very corny lines and the girls are screaming all around every 5 seconds. But then again, if anyone asked me to do bad plays just to give me a few dollars, then hi, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> Overall boring and ridiculous scare.
