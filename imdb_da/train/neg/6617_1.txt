Really shows that hype is not everything. Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and only gets movies because of his father and his wife. Amitabh is always solid. Ajay Devgan who is always shitty and useless, and the new guy is a joke. The leading lady is so wasted by an actor. Such a pathetic film from such an honorary director and from such a large industry. With movies as such, I've reduced the amount of bollywood movies I see. <br /> <br /> RGV has made very crappy movies for some time now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Every other leading lady is a half-naked will be. Pffffft.
