Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) is witnessing the brutal murder of his mother and suicide by his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends to his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where guests confess and confront their worst fears, Mike tries to summon his father's spirit. It is soon discovered that Morty's spirit resides in a wooden indian cabin. The statue comes to life and the carnage begins. <br /> <br /> Most of the F / X is not very convincing, and the movie takes a cheap teen slasher theme. Wrong story was miserable. Cast members are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actor Betsy Palmer.
