VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A motorist (Murray Brown) lures to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and being combed in their outdoor sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied desire for human blood ... <br /> <br /> With his cue from the lesbian vampire cycle launched by the maverick director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammers Carmilla series in the UK, Jose Ramon Larra's bold shocked VAMPYRES concept pushed Adult Horror much longer than British censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974, and His film was cut by almost three minutes on his original British release. It's not hard to see why! By using his Gothic theme as a pretext for so much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the movie's short run-time will allow, Larraz (who wrote the play under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a unique backdrop for a blunt meditation on life death and impulses - sexually and otherwise - confirming human condition. <br /> <br /> Shooting on the spot in a picturesque country house during the fall of 1973, Harry Waxman's ghost film evokes an atmosphere of murky obstacles where the desolate landscape - gloomy and beautifully equal - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier that year with SYMPTOMS, a low-lying thriller erupting in a violent violence in the final reel). In spite of his predictions, the VAMPYRES wafer-thin plot and coarse-grained production values ​​from the beginning will divide the audience, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as may be desired, he (Brown, past his prime at the time of the movie) is violently overlooked in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud. A must-see element for cult movie fans, a fun curio for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Watch out for silent superstar Bessie Love in a short como at the end of the movie.
