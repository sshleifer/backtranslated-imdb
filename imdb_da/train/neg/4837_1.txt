I went to watch this movie simply to see what the whole hype is about and I was so disappointed as surprised at how it got 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb from today. Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest instructor ever to win the best picture and best direction Oscar for this kind of a really really bad movie and I wonder why? Did the completely unrealistic "cowboy" bomb disposal man tell something to someone I couldn't see? Why did I continue to get the mental picture that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movies about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the Wild Wild West infected with 'evil' red Indians; But just this was put in another background this time around? Was it given to Oscars because the director was ex-James Cameron, and made it a good underdog (gossip) story for daytime television shows to munch on? Or was it a kind of Emperor's Clothes syndrome - where most realized it was unwanted, but just couldn't say it because others didn't seem to say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what about the sniper scene where the Shell House fell into high-resolution super-slow-mo as about conveying a 'deep message' or something? Something in the lines of 'EOD boys suddenly makes good snipers and they get the dirty terrorists all the time'? Was it just me who felt that there were so many pieces here and there in the film squeezed in without any apparent reason? And you can get the Oscar to edit and direct it? <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this yet, don't play your money on tickets. Wait until they run it on TV in a few years. You won't miss much.
