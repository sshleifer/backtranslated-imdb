Probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were tweeners. Don't make me wrong, I love stupid, stupid movies as much as the next crazy, but the whole premise, writing and humor stunk. It seemed to me that they were heading for a "Napoleon Dynamite" feeling - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it was forced, awkward and weird. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher, and I just felt terrible that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing. /> <br /> Thank you for not paying for it.
