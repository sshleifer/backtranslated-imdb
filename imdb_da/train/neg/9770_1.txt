This is the version that even the author hated because it is so schmaltzy. They gave it a "happy ending" and changed much of the dialogue and it's just a big pile of saccharin. The "Stage Controller" is quite good, I think he comes from the role, but everyone else falls into the working style of the 40s that really just constitutes. One great feature - the music. This has one of the best results ever recorded and it is worth seeking out in a record store. All in all, I think that the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is much better.
