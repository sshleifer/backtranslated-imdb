First of all, this film reminded me of the old movies that I used to see in the class of religion in school. It's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a predictive and pretentious piece of filth, like the horrible "Left Bag" series. I'm not offended by religious films ... but I'm offended when these religious films just happen to be extremely horrible. I just want to say good things about a Christian movie, but it doesn't seem to happen soon. I bet if you gave the Bible thoughts a decent budget, they would still not be able to make any good. Just avoid this one. Also the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically Reverend Wildmon's shortcomings) radiates about this movie on their website is another reason to make me hate it. In fact, after I have seen this, I went home and looked at my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 classified "Crash". Forgive me Dad, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
