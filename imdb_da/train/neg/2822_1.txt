OMG This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot, I'm a film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money so badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything shes have ever been in, so I saw this 2 tick another off. It was SOO bad! not even bad, just bad bad. It had 1 or 2 fun little moments, but overall it was badly n wasting of 101 minutes. I can't even say that AJ looked good at it, because well she didn't. The reason is predictable unless you expect a repetition of Romeo and Juliet as it is not. All round disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good movie otherwise I really don't recommend it.
