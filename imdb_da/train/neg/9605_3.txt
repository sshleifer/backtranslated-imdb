This Italian movie from the 70s is not even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling or even the horrible American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to see. I'm talking about seeing the leading actress, an amazing blonde, running amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity ... it's obvious she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a hoot, SFX is childish, and the actor (mostly) sucks. The only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there are many) naked and sex scenes. Rather of HBO standards but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK ... HOW IS THE SPOLER ... There is no werewolf (except in her ancestral opening place. The girl just imagines that she is a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
