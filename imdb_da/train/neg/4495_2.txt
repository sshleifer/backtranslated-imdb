Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I liked the original Matrix a lot. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburne's attempt to philosophize, but it was pretty good pace, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong matches. In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cubicist Anderson. During the day, corporate drone, and at night, brave hacker. Eventually he is eventually forced to choose between these lives by his actions - he is forbidden to fight the machine, or he goes back to the safe, forgettable world he started in. , life sucks. He has his girl by his side and his blessed companions, but he eats processed batter, sweat dress and lives in a really skungy bit of machinery. Yet the truth sets him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of the first movie was "what if it was me" issues raised in viewers' minds. What if _I_ was capable of the impossible? What if I was "the one". It doesn't even mean anything so much what you are one example of, with a cool title like that. <br /> <br /> Also, Agent Smith did a wonderful bad guy as he played out all the fear of authority that we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as relentless. <br /> <br /> At the end of Matrix, Neo will return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This movie completely fails to implement the idea of ​​the original movie, and it does so with such a lack of gusto, such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I can't believe they had planned these changes. When the dialogue is at a fifth grade level, with different long words dropped randomly, I find it hard to believe they understand what they are saying. My Short List of Characterization Errors: <br /> <br /> Oracle goes from mildly helpful to fraud to complete obstruction without any real reason. <br /> <br /> Larger "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without the need - for example, the keymaster was a sweet idea, but just not as interesting a character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses its "adviser" role and gets nothing to replace it with. <br /> <br /> People of Zion are not very equal, or would you really have those who drive the world. <br /> <br /> Special Issues: <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are meaningless and intermittent. In Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose, and that he had to become something bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is only the point of view of a particularly badly-ploted video game. The fight on the highway looked rather false and not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing issues. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the battle scenes were immutable. <br /> <br /> The rave went too long - everyone in my row at the theater looked at their watch. Not because we are against good dancing and good orgies, but because we didn't know about the people who were pictured or indifferent. <br /> <br /> Whatever hack wrote, the creator soliloquy should be blacklisted from the company. The twisted, used word that the script writer clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a pacemaker. The Creator's speech could have been done in one tenth of the time, and with more danger as "Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix. There are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is In danger of colliding and killing any person affiliated with them, the Earth cannot support even the people of Zion, let alone these others.You can choose a person from Zion to form the new Zion while I dry the memories of people at the moment in the matrix . "<br /> Instead, we got a long, drawn-out bunch of twaddle. If someone claims to be deep, ask for a transcript and try to break down the sentences. Each one is too long at multiple clauses and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> In short, not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I've seen the third, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. It doesn't save the turkey. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who feel the second and third films were "deep" should see some really deep movies. Maybe read a book or two about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This movie is just not hard to understand, but it's hard to stomach. <br /> <br /> Scott
