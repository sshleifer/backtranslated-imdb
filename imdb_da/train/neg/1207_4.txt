Kim Basinger stars like Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat violent man who comes into trouble while she is out at the local mall that does some last minute Christmas shopping. After placing a sharply hatched hatch on a piece of paper and stacking the paper in the windshield of a car that picked up two parking spaces, she finds out that the owners of the car are Rainbow Coilition of villains consisting of a white guy. Mexican, a Chinese guy & a variety. They confront her with the note, hang a helpless security guard, and chase is on. During the film, Della will hunt for hunters as she unleashes her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I found this to be a little tense little thriller. The action was good enough (except for a few scenes, was "why God why" bit was scary in the guilty cause) It comes enchanted a little because of the sheer fact that the bad guys Della chases from / after are numb stupid. If they had not had the intellect in a given "Home Alone" baddie, their possible defeat might be something to enjoy instead of the reaction it causes. The incredible factor I'm willing to overlook as both the director and one of the producers were part of bringing "Shoot em up" to the screen (a movie that at the same time cast credibility out of the window was incredibly fun). This movie, when I never reached the heights of the movie, was good in its own rights.
