* WARNING * Contains many SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have a great respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress - so I cannot understand her reasons for accepting this movie when she so the script (or lack thereof.) <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie was, in my opinion, a good idea, and there were some genuinely thought-provoking themes in there, but it ended up as a disintegrated souffle. It exemplifies why I hate 99% of British cinema. It feels too long, it's boring, mostly, and not much after the first twenty minutes. Just as you think there's a chance to get some speed, what disappointed Paula Radcliffe is a marathon. With a little imaginative instructions and a minimalist plot, there's not much to keep the audience down in their popcorn. As for the manuscript, I can only convince myself that the author tried to save a few trees with the average scene that read something like "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Adam stares. Adam runs out into the forest) (Alice follows) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I suppose the actors were probably paid more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile ads. The few lines there were did not have much variation with frequent use of the f-word that would make Bridget Jones friend, Shazza, proud. There is a small establishment of the protagonists before the great sordid event that leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic 'Oh, it's terrible' reaction. <br /> <br /> Alice is not the kind of woman who court sympathy either. She has a good job, an expensive London apartment with rooftop to die for yet, she comes on the screen as imagined, bitter and unhappy before her life takes a trip to the worst. After the attack, a few layers are peeled back what kind of explaining why she is this way to start with, she grew up with a hard-as-old boots soldier who thought to teach her to shoot her gun was the ultimate expression of love, so instead of following in he s footsteps, she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel that her life is worth living. Instead, she found a group of stereotyped middle class Toffs, looking down at anyone who is not abundant enough to run Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system (ie, becoming a wife of Robinson a wanna be Cockney Break Electrician Someone sends me a tissue. The one saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a small actress she would have been intolerable one-dimensional, but Mrs Anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless man, especially when she sincerely apologizes for her rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from to continue their attacks. <br /> <br /> I can't say that Adam also went much better. Danny Dyer played him well as a fish outside the water Jack Let, but a good performance could not save him from both the lack of a script and the total lack of any character background. <br /> <br /> This movie was mostly shocked, but the timing was off, and it felt too manipulated from the beginning to the end. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this movie is the pristine demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become; It was almost as disturbing to see as the brutal attack scenes. On a side note, only in a British movie, a gang of violent sex actors would take time to offer each other contraceptives before continuing to cheer on their fellow players - talk about rigid-upper lips taken to extreme! If this is the kind of movie that the national lottery donates money to do, then I am not surprised that fewer and fewer people choose to spend their pounds each week. <br /> <br /> Saying I hated this movie gives it too much credit, I didn't care for any of the characters to justify the strong feeling. I want back and forth in my life, thank you!
