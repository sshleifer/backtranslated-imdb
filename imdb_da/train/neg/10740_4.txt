This movie starts with a certain promise; But in my opinion, losing it begins when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. The fact that this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is out to make a phone call is impeccable enough, but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on The track is the type of Random Beginning Authors warned against using in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie average at best. Art direction could have been much better, which could have been movie. The act was good, and it was also Eva van der Gucht's song.
