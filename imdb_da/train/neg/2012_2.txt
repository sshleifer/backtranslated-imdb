Life in a future fascist or near fascist state that severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurring theme in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such works send us warnings of unwanted tendencies in our society to watch out for; But to be effective, they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately, most of the books are likely to be more effective in sending the warnings than entertaining us enough to be widely read; while with the movies, the problem is normally the reverse. The first such much-known work was probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948) and still available in the form of a book and as a film. <br /> <br /> Watch or read: And when you feel a little depressed by human inhumanity to man, you reach Cinderella 2000. This is a feather light low-cost comedy based on the same theme that gives effortless but unwavering view; And as with 1984, the calendar has now gone beyond the previous period. Most of the comedy is done with a trowel, although there are only a few really fun moments. In order to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these, you can focus on the question of whether this movie will have a new extension of life by being released as a DVD, or whether it will eventually disappear into oblivion, as existing tape copies are deteriorating. redemption. Today, there are many worse movies like DVDs, and honestly I don't care what happens either. <br /> <br /> So far, the best of the movies in this genre have probably been "The Tailor's Tale" but I would very happily swap them all for a well-made movie of Jack London's touring novel "The Iron Heel". Ambitious as this would be, it still seems incredible that no modern film producer has yet dared to try it. (IMDb only shows a B / W style version made in Russia in 1919).
