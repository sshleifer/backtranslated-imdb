A charming boy and his mother move to the middle of nowhere, cats and death follow them soon. It sums it up. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm a little freaked out of cats after watching this movie. But to a great extent, despite the many things that are wrong with this movie and believe me, there is plenty of walking around, it is generally a very enjoyable experience. The people are more like caricatures here with only their basic instincts to trust. Fear, greed, pride or anger seem to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that the seemingly failing actually serves the story of history. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King manuscript (not that I have anything specific to Mr. King) is pretty well supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and perfectly appropriate music. The absolute gem of this movie is undoubtedly Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady, the second worldly mother. King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different (okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twist it in a campy over the top little horror gem to be in the collection of Any horror fan.
