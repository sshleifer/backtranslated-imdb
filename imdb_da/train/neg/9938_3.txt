Jean Luc Godard's Marxist controversy is as close to a relentless movie as you will probably see from an internationally respected filmmaker. Bits of political theater, mind-numbingly boring and interminable, are mixed with making "Sympathy for the Devil" with the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of song development, from Mick Jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar, to backing the vocals being recorded to the end, is fascinating and it is worth hiring this movie just to watch the pieces with Stones. Almost half of the movie is dedicated to this, so thanks to the miracle in the chapter, you can skip all the bizarre political sketches and just see that Stones put a song together. <br /> <br /> When I had this on laser disc I was trying to see it all, but I can't see how anyone could get through it. I finally gave up and just chapter - exceeded my way to the Stones segments.
