I rented the dubbed English version of Lensman, hoping that since it came from well-known novels, it would have some substance. Although there were obvious things in the movie, it was mostly not above the level of children's art. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the copied version. Or maybe the source novels were light. But for some reason there wasn't much there. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise defective. Some examples: The opening scenes were borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and hyperspace star warfare. The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". It begins to try to borrow its comic relief style from Star Wars, but mercifully (since humor doesn't work) gives up on comedy and plays it seriously. In that sense, it is better than the Star Wars franchise, which started with a smart sense of humor, and ultimately worsened Jar Jar's irritation. <br /> <br /> The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. The harvester drove through the unpaved center of a field and dumped silage on un harvested crops instead of working from one side to the other and dumping the silage on already harvested rows or in a truck. Corn (corn) poured the grain route out, but the farm lands were drawn as a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight to the stage. It could have been partly the English-language actor, but the drawings did not show much weight either. Kim's reactions to that scene were not convincing either. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a sign named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little response, although apparently they should have been dense. (Henderson's death is no spoiler; his name is not revealed until his death scene.) She seems to forget him immediately. Someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. I think the actor deserves most of the blame in that case; there is at least a glance at the feeling in the drawings of Chris. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, villains fail to execute their orders. A villain often leads these mistakes with miserable deaths. I can't say if it is lifted from Star Wars or if it comes from a previous source - possibly the Lensman books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where a spaceship collides. As it plunges to the ground, parts of the ship break. But so many pieces fall off that there should be nothing left of it when it lands. <br /> <br /> While Chris in most cases seems like a competent, hard-hitting hero, there is a scene where she screams as an incomplete lady in need. Anyone who is hard enough to come across Henderson's death so fast must at least be able to shout: "Help, it's got me, and I can't reach my gun!" instead of just screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with the most personality (almost too much at times) is D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, D.J. in American graffiti. I wonder if he is so well spoken in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the film exploded. The explosions were unimpressive and seemed to blame a lot of inspiration for Star Wars. However, for his credit, the cause of the explosion was quite unlike the Death Star's primary weapon. The dialogue had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the movie look good, not just the planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and there is also some influence from Tron. On the other hand, the sound effects are often quite decent, although it emphasizes the cheesy sounding parts. Art is good too, especially when it stays away from the often cheesy computer graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can get away with many production deficiencies. But the plot here was pretty easy. A naive boy is trying to help someone on a crawled spaceship and acquires a great power that he doesn't understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions are fighting against a strong, impenetrable evil enemy. He creates friends, learns about his special power, and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and skilled enough, he can even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way can make such a story rising over the simple overview, but there is little more than that in this movie. In the end, it's just a kiddie cartoon. However, as it seems that the primary target group is older children, it may not be necessary to be anything more than that.
