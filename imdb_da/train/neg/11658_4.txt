Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 movies, because there is not much of a plot, bad play, pretty boring and some really cheesy jokes. But. And it's a great one, but there's a good actor, a good recurring joke and a good start. The good actor is Tim Curry, the one good recurring joke is the creepy, weird butler with the vile hand that always makes cringey, but laughs worthy things. And the good start is the expedition's spoof. <br /> <br /> The reason for Scary Movie 2 is the protagonists of the original, and a number of new characters along the way are invited to stay overnight at a scary old manor, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you get bored, you might as well see it!
