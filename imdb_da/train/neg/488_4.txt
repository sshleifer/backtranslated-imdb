A horrible movie! It must have been against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and lacked it without recognition. My complaint is not that they have taken liberties with facts; If the story was good, it would be fine. But it is simply bizarre - for all accounts, the true story of this artist would have made for a much better movie, why did they come up with this scary water-silly script? I suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version. Eventually, a summary of the artist's life hurried - we could have saved ourselves a few hours if they had favored the rest of the movie with the same brevity.
