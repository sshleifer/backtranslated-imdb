I am Irish and I have lived in Denmark for a while, so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission. And I will go on record by saying: <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad a thing as "The Fertile Man in Ireland", but it's certainly not up there with other Irish films like the Commitments I went down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are actually quite fun, like Colm Meaney's American-style garda. But the film itself is shot completely wrong. Jumps around the camera and the constant zoom-in, zoom-out tries to give the movie a look like it was a gritty drama. But it is not. This is an Irish lock, warehouse and two smoking barrels, and it has to be shot like this. It must have a smooth movement from one shot to the next. The movie just looks sloppy and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The show is okay, given the horrible script. One of my friends told me it was as if they were just following Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He gives a decent view as a Dublin Dirtbag, but it does not compare in any way to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best achievement was from Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated medieval woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband to a younger woman. I think she must leave her god-horrible stand-up and focus more on her action. <br /> All in all, it does not live up to the expectations of the Irish press or deserve to be considered one of the best Irish movies ever. <br /> <br /> I expect a setback from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: Would you think so much about this movie if it was set in England or America?
