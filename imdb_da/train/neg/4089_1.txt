Warning: This review includes a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said "almost". This is nothing but lots of random scenes tied together in a loose attempt at a story. The main characters (you can't call them "heroes") shoot innocent spectators for their food and also rob the same for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoerotism that were a departure for me. (SPOILER: It looks as if the villain (which is only topless and not naked as other reviews claim) is killed early, but miraculously restores and adds another 70 minutes of audience hype. several times in this cinematic abomination. If you are in a MST3K mood, you can find it here, but mostly you can forget it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead.
