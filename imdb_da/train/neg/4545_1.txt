This delightful fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad movie production can't "open" you to borrow one of the movie's favorite works, but it can leave your jaw relaxed and your stomach sore from laughter or retching. Based on James Redfield's best-selling book, first released in 1993, this binoculars traces the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, when traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else . What he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies that can be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a panpipe blossom and occasionally shouting from a heavenly choir. Although there are many talks about "energy", there is absolute quality missing from the cast cast, the figures of which include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now identified in the rental pantheon. For those who worry, the plot involves the military, the terrorists, and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni gave the inappropriate direction while Mr. Redfield, Child Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the script on a script. In short, the worst movie seen in 40+ years of watching movies.
