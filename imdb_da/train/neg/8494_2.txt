Expecting a combination of scifi and period films about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of the computer, etc., I was disappointed with this movie's invisible pseudoscience and blend of true and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its author (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of mathematics, technology or history that constitutes the subject of the film, but works instead of a kind of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits me with a tender spot, for I have long been irritated by the tendency of art to slip on and terribly abuse science conditions and ideas for the confusion point, eg: Emmy Coer: "information waves have half-life," Ada: "I'm not sure at all that half life is better than no life whatsoever. "<br /> <br /> This movie is worse than not entertaining - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it can attract a viewer to learn about the subject it distorts. I am more likely to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of progress that cannot be distinguished from magic.
