Wow, what a total let down! In fact, people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of "The ring." The story? Was there a? Not in my opinion. Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The whole movie was a dull, stupid mess. I guess there's always a bad movie market with good marketing campaigns. But it's the worst horror movie I've seen this year. And the Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented. No, wait, it would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I suppose many kiddies helped this movie in the box office as it was PG-13 and if it had been rated R, it would have bombed the IMO! Stupid movie!
