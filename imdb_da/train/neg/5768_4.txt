Well, I was first and foremost thrilled to download an animated open source movie that was only destroyed by a demo coil. The animation is excellent, the lip sync is awful and you watch the movie and hope to understand what is happening only to realize that nothing is happening. You feel no feelings for the characters, only shame for the creators to waste their time. I have seen short movies with twice the feeling in half time! This could have been an excellent short film if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering features, but sorry guy story story is what makes a movie.
