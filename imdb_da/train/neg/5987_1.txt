I really didn't like this movie. The reason was very predictable. Typical American plot, I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl kind of stuff in the end. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! - However, I liked the look of Tracy Island and Thunderbirds themselves. And the British were bad? (except for Parker and Lady Penelope) What was it about? Oh, and they continued to say things like "Here come The Thunderbirds" - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why does it? I would like to see this re-made for 20 years with more British cast. I preferred the original series. Pardon!
