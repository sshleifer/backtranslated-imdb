The reason why DVD releases of this movie are black and white is because no one can get a color print of this public domain movie, at best, a modest sailing story. <br /> <br /> Distributed to TV through Allied Artists, DVD's (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title all come from the same 16MM TV printing. Movies broadcast to television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b / w prints because most of the viewers did not have color sets regardless. Striking b / w prints for televisions were also cheaper, as it often involved a few prints to cover all stations running a movie on a syndicated basis.
