I'm so confused. What in the world did this movie deal with? What was the killer motivation? He seemed pretty angry, but I have not yet found out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. As I guess would make it a hill. Or a pile. Of shit. The action was horrible. When I searched for a couple of actors in this movie, they had been in very few things that I had heard of and it came as no surprise. I can't decide if I should be sorry for the embarrassment of being in a movie, so bad, or feeling that they should never be offered another working job again. Start. . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Not really wasting your time with this. There is so little substance that there is nothing there just to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks - NO, one of the worst flicks of any kind that I've ever had to see the accident and I've seen a few.
