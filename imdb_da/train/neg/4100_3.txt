A bit of a disappointing movie I want to say: the actor was stalked somehow. In many cases, I just didn't notice that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or intended for the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe that he is angry (or sad, happy and frustrated). It doesn't happen here. <br /> <br /> The commentary on the authors assumes that you already know the characters were apt. They do things and say things that come out of nothing: signs Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other for dinner; then he blows up and storms out and tells his father: "Don't touch me, you ***!" Perhaps, if we had seen prequel, we would understand where everything comes from, but there is no prequel so we are a little at sea about the cause! <br /> <br /> A strange, quirky thing that Andrew does is go to an old quarry, sit down on the edge overlooking "quiet water" below; Then he enters his jeans pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. He did the same three times during the film; I suppose we should see this as some tortured acts of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It could even have been four times I lost count. <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he has recently become aware of his adoption; This happens very early in the movie, so there is no sense of any dramatic change he had to go through because of this discovery. It is not entirely clear if that is why he is so bitter or if it is about something else. <br /> <br /> I think there is some kind of Lynchian feeling on the movie, but should a first-time instructor really try to scale such a mountain so early in his career?
