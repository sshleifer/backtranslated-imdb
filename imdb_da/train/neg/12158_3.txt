.... may seem far fetched .... but there was really a reality story .. by a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife lived, and she killed wife ,, makes it look like a murder cancer ....... <br /> <br /> In her error, she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him .. so she stopped his work in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota ......... <br /> <br /> last I heard she was in a mental institution, Security Prison .... <br /> <br /> She was still wearing the "engagement ring". as she bought for herself ... and had told everyone that he had bought it for her. The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,, and the murder happened in Minnesota ... <br /> <br /> There was even a feature story in "People" magazine ... Spring 1988 I want to say on page 39. I remember what I was in college at the time, and a colleague of mine had met the individual at the security hospital ....
