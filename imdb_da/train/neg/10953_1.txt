This television accident ban is the most horrible piece of garbage that has ever hit Australian television. The housekeepers are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously unintentional and chosen on the basis that you will probably try to kill them if you were to live with them. As far as I'm concerned, the Big Brother decline in Western society shows how we as a community are in a steep incline to become brain-dead morons. Whatever happened to televisions that did not measure against society's lowest common denominator as the audience? This cannot be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian, and when he first moved to Channel 10, it became terribly unfunny. With the exception of The Simpsons, which is very intelligently made.
