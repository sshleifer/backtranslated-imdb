Yes, Marie Dresler drinks prune juice, which she believes is married, and she goes out and runs. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but she is a solid performer who probably holds the screen. <br /> <br /> I saw this on Polly Moran, as I've seen elsewhere. Here is Moran OK - just OK - like Dresslers shrewish friend / enemy. Too bad, she is immersed in almost complete oblivion. <br /> <br /> The foundation is kind hearted. Bad guys are trying to rob city citizens. Dressler triumphs and finishes well. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during depression, so maybe everyone was familiar with the bonds and what they can do if they are used well and if they are used incorrectly. However, I am not in that era, I am vaguely familiar with them. They are just like different stores, right? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary unit.
