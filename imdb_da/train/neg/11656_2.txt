Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simply refer to movies, such as Mission Impossible 2, not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a fun white folk rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The film kills from there unfortunately. The action is horrible. Tori Spelling looks and works out of place. The movie looks choppy and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail-paced movie involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie were fun for anyone in my theater. The movie, fortunately, is going to be intoxicated for 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I'm saying shockingly because the end doesn't even end up with humor) I don't know what to say except it's a sloppy, hasty successor made to make Miramax a little more money on the back of stupid teenagers . Overall, a very poorly made movie.
