What a stinkeroo turned out to be !!! At one point, much earlier in his career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no big shake as an actress, but very beautiful and comfortable (especially in films like "The Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand") But when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of her golden days quickly faded. The story is incredible and farcical, the acting second movement, the supportive shock that is ineffective. I can't think of a more immature performance of anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray should be the most boring leading man they could have chosen. Added to this was the horrible photography (and I'm not just referring to the color!) Anyone associated with this must have shake when it was shown.
