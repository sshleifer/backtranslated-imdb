I downloaded this movie for the purpose of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I got myself into. <br /> <br /> I started the movie and soon I was drawn into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> Finally, I know what the hell is there It's this movie. Forever. This movie has no value. It didn't even have a plot. There were things going on in each scene, but no overall explanation as to why something was happening. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you line the nearest blender with oil and try to equip as many bullets in what you can. You will find that the result is far more comfortable than this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't even see it. Not even seeing how bad it is. I beg you. If you see it, it means they win.
