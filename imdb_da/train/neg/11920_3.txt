Oscar Wilde's scripting skills, perhaps the wittiest game ever written, is anything but broken in the hands of another movement. Sanders, as one expects, is randomly indolently brilliant in Lord Darlington's role, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain tries a stage accent in alternative sentences, and the other members of the cast seem to believe that this is a melodrama and not a comedy; Yes, the whole production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy - it is undoubtedly the Hays office insisted. Preminger's direction seems to be most important to ensure that there are plenty of waiters and even though the music seems banal. Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs Erlynne; or try reading the game to enjoy the words. But skip this version.
