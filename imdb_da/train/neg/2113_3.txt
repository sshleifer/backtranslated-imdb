The brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. No one knows why, who or who, but a study reporter (Luana Walters) notes that each bride had a strange orchid and she goes to interview with her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz a mad scientist with some strange habits including sleeping in coffins and spraying his older wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the liquid of young brides to keep her young. Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough maturity that it should not be able to get bored. Unfortunately, while it starts quite well, it begins to pull halfway and becomes rather boring with its clich√©s and predictable plot. There are some good things about it - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, remote and very creepy countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter here. <br /> <br /> It maintains a little gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall, I just couldn't keep my interest through the whole picture, and for that I have to judge it badly.
