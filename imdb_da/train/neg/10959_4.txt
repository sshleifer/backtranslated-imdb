I am a fan of the series and have read all 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only thing to look at is those who have already read the series and are curious about it. It's pretty bad and will turn you off reading them. Not to be mediocre, but Lucy is so ugly that it detracts from the movie. Was she the director's daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. She had an overbite that would shame every beaver. The movie just loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein LOTR books, or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beaver, wolf) look stupid, Aslan was really good as it wasn't just a human actor walking around. (I suppose it is the old horse cart? 2 people inside?) Also, I would be curious what children think of this movie. Maybe they would enjoy it? But as for adults, they will certainly not, even if a CS fan.
