When I was in the movie store the other day, I went up Blonde and Lace, but something about it just seemed like it could be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people based Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Lace could just have been another secret treasure that was passed on. But when I started to see it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both what was considered the top of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not at all aging and they played roles that I thought were more meant for women who is supposed to be in their 20s, not their 40s. The story was just plain and unpleasant. Dee and Dawn are your stupid stereotype blonde, they really have no idea what is happening in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow confused with the killers, the police are on their narrative and actually call the girls' geniuses because of their "ignorance is bliss" attitudes. They are set up to make a "hit" on a guy, and they think they will just "show him a good time", but the right killer is crossed and wants the case and killing the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost as if they are reading the script the day before. I know this was going to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went on unpleasant and was just unnecessary. Will I ever recommend this? Not for a million years, the girls at this time are trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", it is more a sign of desperation, and Blonde and Lace is a big blond BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
