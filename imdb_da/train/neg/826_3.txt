I love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what were they thinking of accepting this crap ??? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger called only; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably like this too. I hated both. 3.10
