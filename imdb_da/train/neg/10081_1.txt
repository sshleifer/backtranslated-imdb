I have read some of the comments about this movie and can only convince myself that some people can easily entertain. This movie is nothing. It is so poorly written, corrected and acted that it hardly gives an impression. The characters speak in the clich√©-ridden dialogue and the situations are completely unreliable. Although it can make this campy and fun, it doesn't, because everything is so lifeless, the movie becomes blunt. It is as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling for her sexuality, but then she was also not allowed by studio experts to give the story something really lively or had no cojones. This movie could go into encylopedia as the default problem poor Lifetime TV movie.
