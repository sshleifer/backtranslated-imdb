Ignoring (if possible) the boring free marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films), gives a rather credible performance. It's as far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The reason is overloaded with "wow" symbols designed to look good on movies but not go anywhere. A rough example is the giant peach flow, naturally left by a city parade and donated by the local cannery. It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free, yet irrelevant prop! The peach gets a short-lived, inexplicable washout at some point, but this is where it ends. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the constructed "black spot" road sign where Steph's parents were killed was intended to symbolize the final escape from her past, but her escape to what? She has had a good deal where she was, especially considering her visual handicap and the endless loving patience and care of her understanding of young female guardian. However, Guinness's award for corny melodrama goes to the characterization of Alan Alan successfully attempts to be the noble role of the union manager, but "rats" on his co-workers by becoming a guide to an evil multi-national elevator! hiss! As a tutor, Alan performs the boss's rogue dirty work. He makes redundancies until, surprise, surprise, the whole factory is closed, and Alan himself is back as a pathetic, unemployed failure. No clich√©-free zones here, buddy! Not only this, but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you will encounter. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic, don't ask for details. What is the importance of the cutting edge for Steph's seductive legs? Why not make the hotel, where the couple loves, eventually that a person gets illegal access to one of his biggest bedrooms and among other things the pandemonies become the plates regularly dirty - quite spectacular on an occasion. Summary of this movie in one word: Avoid, avoid, avoid.
