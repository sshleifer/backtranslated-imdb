This is the primary example of low budget and wins over what would be a good storyline. Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong (after seeing his work on OC I know she can do better), find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad and pretty badly computer-generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And Samaire Armstrongs (warning!) Changing to a werewolf was done by reducing her initially to a poor GCIF figure before she even begins to change (Final Fantasy's people, as well as Pixar have made these ridiculous, think of the figure like a naked Barbie doll). <br /> <br /> The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. Since it also entered the balance between evil, (perhaps) not so evil, and the possible end of human nature, the two lines should mate. The sub-plot of a "book of werewolves", which performed some of the other characters in a game-like fashion for some time, was effective, but could have been extended more to explain what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Insert a better script and direction and I would come back again.
