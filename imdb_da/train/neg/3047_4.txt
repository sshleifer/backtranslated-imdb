I watched this movie several times in the late 60s / early 70s when the bred it is head like a rabid with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matin√©e kiddie show.It was always fierce competition for THE CHRSTMAS, which was not (oops - I can say "Christmas"?), perhaps the biggest and most iconic Christmas season movie all the time. But that's another review. At that time, I was amazed that the color tone of the SANTA monitor CLAUS was almost "pink and white", so much had the color of tooth-powered prints changed color. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit scary! I thought so - and still do. I was very entertained then, as I am still! It's fun in a "retarted-elf" kind of way. By the way, the picture quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, around 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you expect maybe "the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special- Forget it! If you want FELLINI, you need Christmas - read on ... By nature, the duplication of these foreign films (the original version here in Spanish) always made them "surreal." This adds to the film's inherent oddness, which is also quite scary because a "mishevious demon" (as described in the original American trailer) spends the entire movie trying to make decent children "evil." A special nightmare scene has a young "lock key" boy who wants to have parents for Christmas - suddenly "port-a-family" comes out of giant "Christmas gift greetings" until he realizes See that, Christmas lovers - and if you're a stoner, save your stash - this movie will make you think you're hallucinating ... without drugs!
