It is interesting that a novel without a plot has become the basis of two films. While Heiress was a good, if not quite, fit, Washington Square is a heavy-handed and poorly-traded, except for the part of Dr Sloper's films that could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempt to make "beautiful" scenes was so obvious that I actually called. It has none of the undervalued and simple beauty that a movie without a plot can have, like Onegin. I agree with other comments about Leigh's depiction of Catherine as an idiot, rather than naive and shy; She made me feel like she didn't feel like her. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childhood trust to adult cynicism, the whole point of history, was internalized, just as it was in the novel. But we do not benefit from a narrative voice to tell us this in a movie! I think someone passed the adaptation class at the film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempt to make a moving and beautiful movie out of a difficult text, but it just didn't work.
