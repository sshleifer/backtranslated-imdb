Another horror flip in which a giant teenager is fighting with a madman and his supernatural sidekick that will take over?! Yes, but the fact that this was from Canada gives it a slightly different feeling. "Brain" has a cumbersome teenager, Jim Majelewski, who is being treated, whose leader turns out to be a cult leader with the help of a great nasty brain. Can Jim stop him? I assume that since our northern neighbor has achieved everything they have achieved, they have the right to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still they will probably be known for having national health care and everyone. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why didn't the people make this movie?
