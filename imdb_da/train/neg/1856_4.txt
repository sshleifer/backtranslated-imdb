I'm so happy and surprised that there's so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the movies produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception all this company is dealing with, pure crap! Firstly, and it is very important, never watch the movie sober! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one I feel is intentionally bad. I just can't figure out how false the snow is, and therefore it is always only shown briefly, the way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's piece crap, becuz that was made to be a good movie and that version is as bad as this.
