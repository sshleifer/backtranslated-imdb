I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally I saw him as the star of a new movie, not just a part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say I didn't like was that the movie was made in an abandoned part of town, and there was no background traffic or lookie loos. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the actor leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to cringe it up, and the support casting gives something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo and he made the movie visible. Otherwise, I would have written it as another miserable movie. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects from the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some flaws in the movie (continuity), but they are overseas considering the low-caliber of the movie. All in all, I enjoyed the movie because Arnold Vosloo was in it. <br /> <br /> Jackie
