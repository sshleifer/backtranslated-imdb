Blue ape is actually mentioned in the movie, but not in any way that makes any sense. At some point some children are wandering through the deeper levels that are exploring. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they find down there, and one of them (a girl) says she bets, they find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Absolutely insignificant with the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she would assume she would find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement. I am embarrassed to have remembered it, but someone must remember I suppose!
