Another chapter of the ongoing question, what happened to Mel Brook's sense of humor? It starts off nicely with Mel as Trump-like mogul Goddard Bolt ("You can call me God") who accepts a bet that he cannot live on the street for 30 days. But the moment the movie hits the streets, it becomes a pathos-laden mess, with occasional "fun" bits interjected (Mel sees a black kid breakdancing for money and trying to make a vaudeville buck and wing, yuk, yuk). Leslie Ann Warren is nothing short of wasted. The worst part is this movie's musical number, where Brooks and Warren make a quiet dance to Cole Porter's "Easy to Love". Brooks' musical parodies are usually the highlights of his film; Here he plays the whole thing as a dance move from an aging guest star on "The Carol Burnett Show" (where Rudy DeLuca, this film's co-author began his career). Go hire Charlie Chaplin's KID, which covered the same reason 70 years before and did a lot
