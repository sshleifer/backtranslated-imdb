I'm not usually a slate a movie. I try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you want to do something so bad, why bother it? Part of the movie takes up shot by Anne's face as she breathes deeply, and the violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wood-like. Rupert Penry Jones is expressive. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister in a modern way. Anne is portrayed as gentle and self-indulgent, which is fine at the beginning, but she remains the same movie, and you see no reason why Captain Wentworth falls in love with her. Overall, the production lacks any kind of periods, with too many mistakes to be overlooked, like running out of the concert, kissing on the street and running around the streets without a hat (why was this scene in the movie at all? The scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.). To sum it up, a horrible movie, very disappointing.
