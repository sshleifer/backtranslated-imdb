A rather worthless TV movie that largely follows the killer insect script. Ants mysteriously transformed into killer ants near a hotel. I think it's from the hotel's food because the wastewater from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the bog. There is a lack of excitement in this movie, and neither is it scary. Seeing a bunch of ants waving their victims is not very scary. <br /> <br /> Spoiler's section Stupidity is almost unbelievable. He is told the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wreckes the great marsh oil. This interferes with millions of ants and traps the people of the hotel. <br /> <br /> End spoilers Overall, this film is extremely poor. I don't understand why it got a DVD release when so many deserving movies have none. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is recorded in the movie. This is a movie to avoid.
