My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitors name on the box. This movie is a travesty I hope she ignores her resume. <br /> <br /> "The plot" was lost and relaxed, the play was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The film made no sense at all. The coarse plot of an alien parasitic species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this, such as the invasion of body-snatchers and the faculty. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the misfortune to cross this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How it looks like a horror movie when there was no need for fear, excitement, gore, terror or any of the usual horror movies Techniques I don't know but if you still find yourself who wants to watch this movie, i suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand so you can find parts of the fun.
