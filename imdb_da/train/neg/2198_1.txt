A scientist and his girlfriend run out when his speed evokes a car accident. He escapes unhappy, but she is beheaded. He saves her head, brings it to his house and keeps it alive (!!!!). He then continues to examine models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His convicted assistant looks over his head, beginning to talk and has a telepathic (or telepathic) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet .... As you can see, it's pretty stupid stuff, but I had some love to it. As I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed this movie about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They always showed it on Saturday afternoon television unknown. Watching this on TV was amazing! Explosive blood and gore with a cruel monster and dizzying sexual exploitation - who cares if it was good? Seeing it now, I realize how miserable this really is. The play is utterly miserable, the production values ​​are non-existent, the manuscript is rather stupid and (apart from the still rather obnoxious) it is stupid thing. There is also a mild cat struggle between two women and the great monster at the end. Also add an end that leaves tons of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film. On the other hand, it is a complete garbage can. Anyway, it's not a good movie, but it's a must-see (for once) horror and gore fans. Also, the head's grin is pretty scary. Note the final credit that gets TITLE wrong (call it "HEAD That Would not Die")!
