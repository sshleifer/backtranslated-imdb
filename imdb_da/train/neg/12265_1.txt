Particular effects of this film are, in particular, ridiculous and used in such an overloaded manner that you cannot deny their terrible existence. The play redefines the concept of "terribly overactive" in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine "bad". <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie can be found in two things: First, the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" is Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and always be there. <br /> <br /> The other is The SF-Western combination is, of course, original, if awful, but other finds are more original, such as gunman Zack Stone is able to feel the pain of the people he shoots (though his plays fall here). <br /> <br /> Everywhere ... you can't see this movie except if you love the odd brother-in-law Carel Struycken, who every self-respecting Dutch should.
