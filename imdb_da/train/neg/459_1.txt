I was looking for a sweet, simple comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie turned out to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write a single good thing about it. First, the manuscript is stupid and not fun at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a tortoise for laughing. In my book, it's not fun, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Make budget 'effects' (if I can even call them effects) with horrible filmography. In many places it almost feels like an indie film shot without money. <br /> <br /> Works ... I'm sorry the actors. Is Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for some money they have agreed to participate in? (Looking at their latest filmography, it looks like that.) Despite the outfits, Pamela shows her age, and as a whole, they don't even come to be so sexy, let alone fun. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't even in that bad, it's fun category. It's just bad as if everyone involved was sick of it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
