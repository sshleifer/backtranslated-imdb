This movie sucked. The action sucked, the script sucked, and the movie gathered. There were two threads in the film that were not developed, and the viewer had to do some work to find out what happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it should be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said to have the slightest idea of ​​what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Hearts' negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows something about the guy and how he is tied to the death of his fiancée. The viewer also has minimal exposure to his death. <br /> <br /> Suddenly there is a scene with a bunch of guys putting up and hanging machine guns, and that's all you see before you cut down to the other scenes. No explanation of anything about the guns and the people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave it a 3 because we didn't want us back our time. It was fun to choke the movie while you watched it, so it gave us at least some entertainment. ;-)
