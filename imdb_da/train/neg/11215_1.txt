Okay in the beginning, this movie seemed pretty good, even though it moved pretty fast, and although they only had a budget of $ 60,000, it was fine, but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her, why should you chase him around and pull a gun on him with just one ball and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and getting yourself killed? Plus, after you've found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and found out who the murderer was, why wouldn't you give that track to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, as acting as her sister, who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy, she had to meet him somewhere and record him that she was dead and what happened to her "proof". I don't know I wasn't happy with the end. This movie could have been so much better if it lasted longer and the actor was better and if the end didn't suck so badly! Don't waste your money on this movie because if you do, you'll also write a review here and won't be happy.
