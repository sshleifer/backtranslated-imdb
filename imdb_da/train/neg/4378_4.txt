Considering the title and the outlandish box art, I was ready for almost everything. Perhaps my expectation was forced to a little too high because I was a little dry. <br /> <br /> A movie crew member working on a soft core film ends in a strange house when they are lost in fog and determine the best way to spend the evening is having sex. Where hasn't this setup been used before? The difference here is sex's uber-perverted character. Not allowed to show all the goods (traffic lights were illegal in Japan for a long time, it showed is the fog). The film tries as hard as possible to show the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <Between all the kinky goings, a mud monster (whose origin I can't understand) shows up and starts killing the men and raping the women ... and then killing them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, especially a woman who has her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting a mouthful of ... things, but otherwise doing a pretty standard fare. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is pulled down by its own designs; it is for the superficial to be a stern horror image and too cruel to work as a sex girl. The media can work, but there must be balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
