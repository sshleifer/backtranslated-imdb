Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible ..... . . . . . As a refined Robin Williams fan, I felt the need to buy this movie as the first screen appearance. Wow ... I couldn't imagine a more mind-numbing movie. Essentially, the movie takes a bad joke after the other, that your uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec shit. <br /> <br /> I'm a bad mood, but this humor was not pleasant vulgar or ribald ... it was just insane. There are no redeeming qualities for this movie, except for Robin Williams fanatics, like me, who simply own every piece of film.
