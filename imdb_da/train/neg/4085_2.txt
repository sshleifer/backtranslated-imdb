"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to steal in a mess in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I assume is considered "art" but don't be fooled ..... it's garbage. Stick to the "art" you can admire in a frame because the films that are tagged as such are usually incomprehensible fakes like this. In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "The Tempest" while the camera's pans away for naked people. one of them a toddler walks in a swimming pool. Wow, these are boring things and true "art," isn't it? It's just an example. Most of the history makes no sense, is impossible to follow, and therefore one is that liberal critics are afraid to say they do not "understand" so they give high marks to save their false egos. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
