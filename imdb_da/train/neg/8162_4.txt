Your attitude to Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the movie. If you expect a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like camp movies that are pretty fun to see unfold, you like this one. Lisa Schrage has her time playing one of the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd, and Schrage is furiously perfect in his time "obsessed". <br /> <br /> Not a classic cinema, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with an evil end. <br /> <br />
