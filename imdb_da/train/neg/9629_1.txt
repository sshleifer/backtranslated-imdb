I saw it for free, luckily and wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to add to us in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposites - yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this plot line doesn't surprise you and spans you, the movie won't. <Br /> <br /> Lots of sight gags and speed jokes. Halfway through the movie, I began to realize that Ben Stiller really isn't that much fun, but he's trying very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is really not that beautiful, but her hair looks good. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have been paid a lot of money to be in this kind of average hohma movie I've come to expect more from them. What was interesting was that I saw this after I saw American Splendor, who is a real funny and original movie - and I compared the two in my head and found myself wishing that the film's leaders would be forced to sit through the two movies back to the back - maybe it would have some meaning in them and they would start making better movies with unknown rather than those formal things that play best on airplanes.
