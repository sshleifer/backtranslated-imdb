I was lucky enough to read the book before I saw the movie. It was an epic of adolescence, a dream of summers away, a great potential indie film or big budget drama. It somehow came into the hands that clearly took notes for Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The script loses the flesh in the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low breasts. I'm sorry the actors as the letters were rich and textured, but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when it gets an opportunity, like Dylan Baker, but the skeleton left by history plays out like a bad after school special. Bad People = GOOD, Rich People = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it's almost worth seeing to see the Southern California beach, Gary Sinise parks his trailer, which is supposed to pass for a Delaware bay. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing trip to first-time director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
