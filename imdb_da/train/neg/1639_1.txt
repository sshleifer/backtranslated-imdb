"Whipped" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three unlikely New York Lotharios, ruthless "scammers" end up waking up the same woman played by Amanda Peet with disastrous results. It applies to the story and the film. For sophomoric to be misogynistic, lax and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends the philosophies of shock jock Tom Lykis with Penthouse letter fantasies. Though technically competent, it is dated, lattice, poorly written, medium and obvious. People don't seem like this. People don't talk like this. Really.
