To raise the drama in this sudsy maternity ward story, it is set in a special section for "difficult cases." The main story is Loretta Young's; She is on holiday from a long prison stretching for murder. Will the doctors save her baby at the expense of her life or observe her husband for the opposite? The melodrama and mood are dominant, and they are not the honest kind, at least. For example, to keep things moving, this hospital has a psychiatric ward at the venue and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies. There is just enough laugh and sarcasm that this can be recognized as a Warners movie, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who throws gin from his hot water bottle while waiting to get twins that she finds for her chagrin that now is a law against selling. An example of her repartee: "Beware." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is, of course, wonderfully authoritative as the top nurse, but don't expect her to have a dramatic moment. The main theme of the movie is that the sight of a baby makes someone to mushe. Even with the obvious limitations, this movie should have been better than it is.
