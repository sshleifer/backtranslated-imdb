This movie is about Eddy's story as mentioned in the title and his return to old friends in a seaside community. The reason involves the friendship group as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means of dealing with a friend's death, where he feels somehow responsible. But it is inappropriate, as the choices in production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenshots do not always have to be "chatty", but they must at least help develop the story. Here, a line attempt like "he just went off" or "I know you don't have love in the heart" just do fully evoked something worth the public's time. Also, when the author feels lost to where to go next, he cuts to a music assembly of the protagonist who goes through the fields to some indie mood music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the type that gives quality and substance is more than style, so this is not the movie for you.
