I could have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them next to each other is simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is hasty, many important scenes from the book are omitted, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which I found distracting. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks out in the middle of history and never finished. There are some good points - the battle scenes are exciting to look at, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. See this if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book, you will probably be confused because there is a lot missing in this version. 4 out of 10
