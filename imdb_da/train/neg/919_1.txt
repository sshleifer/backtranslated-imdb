Although I have to admit, I laughed more to watch this movie than the last few comedies I saw. The budget must have consisted of pocket changes from the actors. The production values ​​are so low that they actually made it fun to watch. Reminds me of the robot monster, which consists of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on. In one scene, a hitless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I was wondering why the victim didn't start shouting: "None Shall Pass" and "It's just a sore I have been worse". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year. <br /> <br /> The "gladiator / demon" was also a nail. Between the terribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it, the end result was hysterical. Really a movie that is bad enough to be seen. Such as watching a slow motion auto accident on film. <br /> <br />
