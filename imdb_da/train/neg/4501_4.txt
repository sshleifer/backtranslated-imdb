True, the setting in Paris is great. The actors are fine. The story is a twisted moral game. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone bad enough, is it OK to hurt everyone else along the way? In a real romance, you want less clich√© than the man who has been upset by his wife and is willing to dump his family and the woman who is okay to encourage him to do so. So what if they look decent and if Karen Allen shows her body? The characters are still self-absorbing and reprehensible. Perhaps the morality of history is "you get what you deserve". I give it a 4, only for the fast scanning potential through "male interest" bits.
