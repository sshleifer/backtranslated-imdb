What happened in God's name here? How about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain anyone ... anyone, or even make money? But mainly what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic named Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in earthquake gorilla films, such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain mockery titles. In the Gore department, this is not much different from the rest. Although the level of uncertainty ... yes, earthquake. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is gory, think about it. <br /> <br /> Being too specific with history would be a waste of time. An accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living. The concept has never been treated in such a way. Gore effects are a whole new low. Just a nightmare nightmare. I can't tell if it wasn't originally meant to be fun, somehow I doubt the English dubbing was very true to the original script, but foreign things have happened. Everything reminds me of a video introduction to a Troma movie, unless it lasts much longer. I've only seen a movie that was worse than this, Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is an actual instructor, I highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards for what you are looking for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence an attempt, but you have been warned. It takes the nerves of steel to make it all the way through. But if gore is all you are here for, then you may be able to saturate this. Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean no budget, no entertainment value, but mostly no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> Updated 7/5/09: After a few more views on Zombie '90 I have had a change of heart, or I think I just get it now. Zombie '90 is fun, so rediscover the harsh words, although Extreme Pestilence still merely deserves a star.
