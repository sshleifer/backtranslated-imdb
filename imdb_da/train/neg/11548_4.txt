Jeez, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this crooked hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolves around a treasure hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between the Shaw Brothers and an Italian one-off include humorous storytelling, off-the-wall happenings and some very tame T&A. Extra-martial moments are served by Lee Van Cleef's unpleasant wig, leather-clad bible-bursting psycho-gunman Yancey Hobbits (lovingly restrained by Julian Ugarte, the man who should have made far more unclear European genre reproductions than he did) will do humorous dialogue, hilarious background music and absolutely ridiculous sound effects that accompany various small events (especially every hop made by Lo Lieh ). While this little piece of action falls in danger and square into the Turkey Territory, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen and you can't deny the charism of this duo. Don't expect too much and you'll get enough of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
