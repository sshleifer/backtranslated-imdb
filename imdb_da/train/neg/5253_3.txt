The protagonist's name (Frau) is the German word for "Woman". I don't know if it was intentional or not, but if it was safe, I got some giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But they were the only ones giggling the movie. Not that it was aimed at giggles, it's a horrible movie for heaven's sake! A horrible movie in more than one sense. It's a shame that such a premise was wasted with awful, unbearable moments for the viewer (certainly not for the heart's weak !!)! And it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that were shown. I don't even go into a moral obligation (because movies don't really have that kind of job or function) discussion of what is shown here, but it's a new low on the whole "torture movement" that has grown over the last few years!
