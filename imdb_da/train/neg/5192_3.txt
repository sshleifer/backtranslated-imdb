It doesn't take long to see why the Code Name: Diamond Head didn't do it on the network plans. The TV pilot film does not pass the credits until it is obvious how bad it is going to be. Maybe I missed something because the plot didn't make much sense. Based on what I got out of the confused mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The world's sadest secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is out to stop him. There could have been more, but believe me ?? It really doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies must have an action. Suspenseful moments should have excitement. And dramatic moments should have drama. There is none in Code Name: Diamond Head. I've seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this made for tv snoozer ?? And it's better than any word description I can come up with. None of the characters are at least exciting or worth worrying about. And Roy Thinnes makes it possible for the worst leaders to think. His charisma is just north of a slug. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has to do with it, but unfortunately for everyone else, he does not think he should be a regular cast member. Now, if McShane had been thrown into the series, you might have something. <br /> <br /> I soon discover that these Gawd horrible 70s movies for television make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And it goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and Bots. So while I can only give the movie a 3/10, I rate Episode # 608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
