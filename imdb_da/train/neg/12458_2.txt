The movie's premise is so simple and obvious that only a million millionaire in Texas high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if anyone shouted it across the gloomy car park. In summary: The oil business is in cahoots with government (or Gummint if you prefer), Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a unique festering pool of double trading sons-of- (insert word) willing to endure any line that comes their way. The only people who are finished are the good ones, like Mr Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization creates when evil multinational companies stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three. It fits in very well with the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators. In Syriana, this facile tissue of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is promoted in a conflicting vermicelli of narrative strings that twist, twist, and swirl through the gloopy perimeter of their own insignificance until the bad seer is left alone with the conclusion that : <br /> <br /> 1. The "conductor" (good joke) should never be close to a camera again <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt can know how to shop, but they probably do not know how to choose a script <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a movie dealing with corruption in big business and state, then come and see Claude Chabrils "L'ivresse du pouvoir", who are insightful, fun and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Empty, convicted, sentient piffles spun for evening ruin.
