Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many of the original early Hip Hop artists, but they have obviously been clarified that this could be their great break, of course for some it was and it was good. But if you see this as original Hip Hop Culture, you're wrong. It is overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies I mentioned. They've conveyed the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably due to the fact that even though the story, the play, the dialogues and the direction are all terrible, the music and the dance are what people love about it. I love the dance, but at that time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy during the round86, a new generation of now classic hip hop artists such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers emerged , Bizmarkie to name a few), and I still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that's why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style doesn't have much of a story, but the music is big and authentic. Of course, different tastes and it's okay. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is the trash except for break dancing and some of the music, so I can't judge it higher than a 4 out of 10.
