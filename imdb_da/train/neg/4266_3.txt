NOMAD certainly has some of the best equestrian pictures, sword games and scrumptious landscape cinematography you will probably see, but that's not what makes a movie good. It helps, but the story has to shine through on these things. And this is where Nomad walks. <br /> <br /> The story is silent, giving it a feeling that it was thrown together just to make a "cool" movie that "looks" good. Not to mention that many of the protagonists are not from the region where this story takes place (and it is obviously obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If movie producers want to immerse themselves in a culture like the Jugs and the Casas, they make it better to use actors / actresses who see part. <br /> <br /> Warring tribes, a prophecy, fraternal love and respect, a love interest that separates our "heroes" are all touched, but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene or the country's breathtaking beauty. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during the film, especially the director and the filmmaker. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In a sense, Laustsen seems to have a better eye, as his visions of the countries made the final cut we see here. Definitely a good thing. But switching to Bodrov as director may not have been the smartest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on fighting and not the people I feel come from Bodrov's eyes and not Passers. A true travesty. The most shameful aspect is that this could have been a great movie, with both character and action focus. Unfortunately, the highest officials apparently decided that action was what was necessary and took the cheap (intellectual) way out. <br /> <br /> Although I can't give this movie a positive rating, it's worth seeing simply for the amazing movie work. But that's all.
