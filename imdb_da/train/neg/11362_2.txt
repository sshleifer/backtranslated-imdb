"Fly me to the moon" must be the worst animated movie I've seen for a long time. It says something since I've taken my son to see all animated releases over the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous ... trite. The voice effect is terrible, too sweet. The mood is of the Romper Room variety. The animation can be used for a Nickolodeon-type cartoon, but it is released on the big screen, not cable TV. It only gets 2 because of it's OK 3-D pictures. Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image, but we have seen much better in the past. I also question the filmmakers' requirement to have characters fly away from the screen rather than get into it in most scenes. While it is interesting first, it became tedious after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to leave indifference to me from the creators. <br /> <br /> I'll say it though, it had a beautifully cool soundtrack. And for the record, my son wasn't too fond of it either. Bad movie.
