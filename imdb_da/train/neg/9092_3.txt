Friz Freleng's "Speedy Gonzalez" was the second comic to have the title character after Robert McKimson's "Cat-tails for Two". In that cartoon, Speedy has been a nasty little creature with a big gold tooth, but by its second appearance, the known design had already been adopted. Despite the fact that you look considerably more beautiful, Speedy has never evolved into much of a character. A great hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent does not make classical character, and it is pretty much all that Speedy had ever had for him. Nevertheless, the lightweight little mouse showed immense popularity and continued to star in many shorts, including some really unpleasant films from the studio's last days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than the later atrocities where he was often (quite strangely) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, based on predictable gags that are usually based on a similar chase formula. In this self-proclaimed episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory, which happens to be guarded by Sylvester, the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star to the comic, Sylvester's role here could just as easily be filled with any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is ripped off by the fact that he is forced to predict. immutable role pursues. This was always a problem in Tweety cartoons too, but Speedy makes a smooth blunt opponent thanks to his horrible cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his catch. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to see along with Speedy for many years to come. Although it followed a fairly basic formula and with minimal grin, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a thoroughly unworthy star was born.
