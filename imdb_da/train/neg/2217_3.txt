As the faux-Russian scientist says two-thirds of the way into the movie, "I came for science." This is basically summed up the reason I saw this movie - all that involves a half-man, half-hammerhead shark deserves an absolute serious empirical study from an impartial aspiring scientist. Or, as they say in biz, my boyfriend had the brother remote and the rest is history. To say that the special effects were bad would be an accident for the special effects area. It's 2005, it's not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background. Yes, it was charming and state of the art when Hitchcock filmed "The Birds", but in 2005 it just looks low budget. Save me the cheap attempt at Sci-Fi and do me service to actually make an attempt at a willing suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> But if I've seriously defeated the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you again, it's as sad as it may sound, it's probably worth your time. If nothing else, it's a trip to the bad Sci-Fi values ​​that are worth the training for the new movie buffer and definitely worth updating for those who have seen a few movies in their day. <br /> <br /> The crazy hunchback food scientist with a hammerhead transceiver, who thinks it is a good idea to donate blood in nearby water, not only makes me aware of human intelligence, but also "B" authors ability to come up with remote plausible plot lines. <br /> <br /> This movie also meets virtually one of my long-lasting bad movie contents - evil boys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If this wasn't in 2005, I would be amazed at the fact that this movie was a bad bad metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey that puts in the mouth of Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines in the movie is when the chicken without bra insists on Charlton Heston lookalike, "waiting for Tom" as he tries to lift the airplane helicopter off the ground. The thing is, Tom wastes the bad sunglasses with his endless banana clips attached to his Kalashnikov or AK-47 on the layman's terms. As the mad scientist says at the end of the film, "my goal is to develop the human nature" - that is enough to say that this film only contributed to the degradation of humanity. The weak freudian references published by the mad scientist when he prints the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark is a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction, we can all find something to laugh about.
