After too many bad memories, I went to skip this episode every time it appeared in the Season 2 sequence. I have recently seen it again just to remind me why. I have always considered this to be the worst ST: TNG episode (except for "Shades of Gray", which hardly counts as an episode). I continue to listen to the lumpy dialogue and thinking of the red-penciled script by the author's Writing 101 teacher: "SHOW, DO NOT TELL!" From Deanna Troi's statement and everyone else's constant elbow calls for what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinan's explanation of how much fun she drops joke (it's not) to who worried about the resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that is not highlighted and tripled emphasized for our structure, and there is no credible moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is also for whale animals that can be carved to be the centerpiece of the plot's work. On the other hand, no one missing John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") could pull off this underwritten placeholder of a role. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, to the data plane. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being fun decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to do with here. Even though Jerry Lewis- The bit was fun in a stupid way. <br /> <br /> On a good day, you might think of this as a charming little tribute to a less original series episode. I'd rather skip to "Time Squared" or "Q Who."
