I've been known to fall asleep during movies, but it's usually due to a combination of things, including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the set and just eating a lot. But on this occasion, I fell asleep because the film was bad. The reason development was constant. Constant slow and dull. Things seemed to happen, but without explanation of what caused them or why. I admit that I might have missed part of the movie, but I saw the majority of it, and everything just seemed to happen independently without any real concern for anything else. I can't recommend this movie at all.
