Horrible movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he becomes involved with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Soon, Rome will be employed to find out what happened to a woman. Of course it is the woman under the sea. Her roommate, Lainie Kazan, quickly wins the floor. <br /> <br /> An aging Richard Conte plays a police officer and a friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, the blame falls on Rome and there is an interesting hunting scene. It's so bad that this picture is if you have to rely on a chase scene to deliver the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue. Her acting causes much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired head whose son is trying to exaggerate him. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you don't know why the girl was murdered. Don't even bother to ask.
