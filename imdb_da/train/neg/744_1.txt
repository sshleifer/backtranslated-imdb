Holy Terrible God, all freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... Character effect is the poorest thing I've seen for some time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be on a terrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the cart and you can tell that there is no horse. They flee from alien monsters and go about the same speed as a quick jog. Then it turns into a long shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And CG generally seems to be sub par to 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, really come. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.
