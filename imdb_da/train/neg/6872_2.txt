This show had pretty good stories, but poor dialogue. The protagonist was particularly annoying. Clearly, why this show was canceled, even though I, like most UPN shows, never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re-runs. <br /> <br /> Most of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies that made me believe that the producers did not have an original idea in their minds. <br /> <br /> I haven't commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> Gnome was a nice character.
