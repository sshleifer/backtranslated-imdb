What F * @ # was this I just looked at? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is incredibly bad and stupid. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal now (of course) wanted-de-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength. OKAY? Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Yet in this movie to quell Seagals have-to-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a $$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than they are. But all the average people are crushed around him. Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but it's super human force. Oh and get it, Seagal goes through a short piece of identity problems because he and his cohorts in the movie seem to be Wolverine! Oh my GO ... And worst of all! Yes, that's a worse than that. He has a voice over even changing voice in the middle of the sentence as we look at his face. Of course they leave nothing to him, and I think that may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Even though I wanted to turn it off, I always see a movie so he finishes. This is a low time right for your direct movie video Steven. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Two thumbs down! Redemeption qualities? Well, I guess I will be fair in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and the actors. The women all were quite attractive IMO. Still, and I still said, it doesn't make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) rip off! The director, author, producer, ALL should be bans and exile from the film industry. I think I feel the way most people feel about Blood Rayne (and almost all other Uwe Boll images) about this movie. It's my $ 1.00 on this movie. See if you dare.
