This can actually be the worst movie I ever have the scene. Continuous would be a compliment. Even the end made no sense, but it was a huge relief that it was finally over. I saw it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate, and so did. At the end of this mess, I was sorry some of the characters survived and I did not feel too charitable about the actors either. If you want to see a train wreck, I recommend hanging out at a train station. Even waiting for a deserted train platform turns this mess. Apparently, I have not expected enough to fill out my prescribed ten lines, so I will say it again with the risk of redundancy. This movie is zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. What about minus zero?
