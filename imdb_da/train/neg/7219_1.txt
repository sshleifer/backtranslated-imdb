I still find it hard to understand that a movie could be as bad as this in Hollywood. The story and story are simply pathetic and the direction is horrible. I can't see any logic behind this trash except it might be that the director didn't have any good to do. I took ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dissatisfaction that I had to spend a little more time in my life on this crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know which category it falls into. Please avoid this movie at all costs, just do something, even bang your head against walls, but don't go for this movie.
