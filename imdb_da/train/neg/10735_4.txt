Perhaps being a former moscovit myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from throwing this movie into the "arthouse / festival crap" trashcan. This is not the biggest movie in 2005, nor is it a complete waste. just a lot of problems. I also doubt that this movie was banned due to any ideological fear or conservative taboos or any other reason, this film may be called brave and uncompromising abroad. It was banned because the censors knew that 99% of the Russian movie guests would find it offensive because of the bad taste that was exerted during the recording and editing of this otherwise bad movie. <br /> <br /> So we have a strong opening shot. loaded with meaning and symbolism, the use and placement of symbols will consistently be the strongest aspects of the film (not that number 4 is a frightening visual challenge). or setup A fun and well-written rod conversation among the 3 (most important) characters, and we feel the pathos of these people, Russia's great country, the human condition and all that. Then the film begins to slow down. We begin to wonder what lies ahead. <br /> <br /> The rest is quite boring, simply sat. Well, the guy in the village is dragging his heartbeats, and there are some entertaining moments. Good sound, for sure. But the enjoyment of this movie, not to mention the plot, is seriously compromised by the pacing problems. And it is this lack of payout to sit through everything (nicely shot) creepy misery and gloom, which will ultimately make people angry at the "offensive" things (personally the biggest offensive scene that borders on being endearing pathetic way, harmless drunks can show up). <br /> <br /> To watch an enjoyable movie where the Russians are wasted for a long time (the whole movie), see Visit National Hunt. Much more rewarding post-Soviet stuff. So yes, a 4 out of 10 to 4, nice and symbolic for my post-mediocre movie mode.
