Misty Ayers had a smoking body and it was all this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself and counted on the number of times, the looped warehouse orchestra music. And of course the music is completely without relation to the scenes. Case in point: Casually entering a room and saying "Hello" was scored with chase music from a Roman epic. I would like to know why this movie was on the shelf for 11 years before it was released. What I learned from this movie: The women's low panties existed in 1954. I speak Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie pants. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes take Misty off and wear clothes (except bras and panties, unfortunately). Also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a "Look! Godzirra!" effect.
