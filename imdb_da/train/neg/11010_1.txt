This movie doesn't even deserve one. This was a total waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It wasn't offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is full frontal nudity and foul language. But not only that there is no plot line, the actors are horrible, the accents are awful, the actors are little time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt (who only got a fifteen second part, by the way). I think it could have been a mistake on the directors and the editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times and added only one new sentence. <br /> <br /> A movie similar to this is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing movie in existence. There is no plot line and it is not fun. Although it doesn't try to be fun. WILL NOT SEE EVERY MOVIE.
