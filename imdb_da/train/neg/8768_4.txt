Now, don't start calling me names like "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and more. <br /> <br /> Very long length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is the biggest mistake. No editing at all - works like J.P. Dutta fell in love with her project too much. Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It's based on true events and real people. Kudos for that, but were the repeated war scenes really necessary? In addition, the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another, and it was impossible to keep track of all of them. <br /> <br /> Between skirmishes there were songs about loneliness, love and related things. There were chummy conversations. In the beginning it gave some relief from the violence, but became so uniform later that one could even predict the nature of the coming speech. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers walk around as if they were lions in the jungle, totally unaware that the enemy was lurking somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, it evoked sympathy, but it seemed to be unmindful for them to be such a collision of their security in the first place. <br /> <br /> Music was melodic and the lyrics were soulful, but didn't fit the movie. Better to listen to them on the soundtrack instead of in the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was the saving grace: From experienced veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relative novices like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted as a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention to ease the mood when needed. The dialogues ranged from brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with love !!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan's zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And the explosive spree consisting of all the MCs, BCs, Cs and F words was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil is trying to give an appropriate tribute to the brave Indian soldiers, but tries too hard and ultimately fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
