This movie had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbass route. Maybe it didn't really know who its audience was: but it's hardly a man's movie with cast and plot, but is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Legally Blonde and its successor, it's like the confusingly horrible sequel. Big players like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have steered so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller slam in entertaining roles that are stupid than fun. Many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers, the various uber-clich√© montages, last minute's "misunderstanding", even the children's party chaos. This only suggests lazy scriptwriting. It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don't take it seriously, but it's such a sharp, better-than-you-can-feel frustrated more and more disappointed as the scenes roll by.
