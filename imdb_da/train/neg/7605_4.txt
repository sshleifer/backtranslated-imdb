I think "Gunslinger" was not as terrifying as most of the movies the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, but Westerners are just not Roger Cormans forte. Portrait Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becomes sheriff in an Old West town after her sheriff man is murdered and has to fight off baddies, the movie is pretty predictable. John ireland is praise new hubby, secretly working for incredible allison hayes (yes the 50 foot woman). Also featured briefly frequent Corman co-star Dick Miller as the mailman (Miller today stars in Joe Dante's movie). <br /> <br /> I would argue that you will probably see the "MST3K" version really enjoying this movie. They had a good time with it.
