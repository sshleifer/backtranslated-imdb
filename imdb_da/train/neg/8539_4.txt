This engaging (as it should not be) low Spanish exploitation (pretty tame I can add) looks good, but hey? Let me say it again, huh? In fact the word 'huh?' would go through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it. I just don't know if it is complicated cryptic or just a weathered muddle, but there is no denial of how laconically insignificant, strange and proper it feels. <br /> <br /> Independent sequences tied (like the unpleasant opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) into a sparse story with photographer Mario (played by a breath-breathing John Caffari whose mustache is a dead ringtone to Nintendo's iconic Mario, what are the odds?) who kills his girlfriend at home and meets a young lady (a gorgeously fixing Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on a shooting mission where on this remote mountain retreat they come on across some cap caps. Look past the unheard of plot structure and flew in What is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing discomfort. Raul Artigot directs few sharp unusual visual and eerie passages, but mostly appears sporadically non-existent and unfocused like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking movie image lenses the gracefully rich landscape that we take in the scenic views and let time relax with peace. But there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's frighteningly bombastic and overwhelmed score blends violently with the compulsively lit atmosphere. The wires are capable, but there is also a robust group (the voter is VÃ­ctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slowly in the way of interest, but this dreamy setup (which seems to go on and on) manages to keep you going until it closes.
