Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of satan / serial killer who holds the "first power". Even after being caught by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder on will. With the help of the attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G's half-sister), he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> I think this concept probably had some options, but ultimately "The First Power" suffers from routine scripting and movie making. This is nothing we have not seen before, sometimes done better. There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More to that point, it is not that exciting, and it is certainly not scary. Phillips is a hard sell like a hard-as-nail, cynical cop stereotype, and Griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard; Best throwing member is probably the distinctive Kober who does his best to be extremely creepy. The climax is pretty stupid and the end very weak. Not quite enough acceptable to judge as an average film of its kind, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
