This movie was just combed by MST3K and for good reason. First of all, because it's a "cop" movie starring Joe Don Baker, as we all know, is about as good a politician as Michael Jackson is a nationwide singer. All the typical copfilm plot units behind their ugly heads, bar fights, kids hostages in shoot outs, bad plays, lame police chiefs, bad plays, revenge / justice, endless goons and of course, bad acting. Don't look at this without a MST3K filter people.
