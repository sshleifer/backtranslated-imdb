Hollywood Hotel was the last movie music directed by Busby Berkeley to Warner Bros. His instructor style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not include his signature overhead shot or large production numbers with thousands of extras. In the last few years of the thirties, major bands' big swing band recorded this year's biggest popular hits. Swing Era, also called Big Band Era, is dated differently from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. 1935 was certainly one of the early signs that the turn came into the consciousness of the ordinary American youth. When Goodman highlighted his swing repertoire instead of the dancing music music his band had played, the youth went astray in the audience. It was the beginning, but since radio, live concerts and mouth to mouth were the primary methods of spreading the phenomena, it took some time before the swing made enough inside to produce big hits that appeared on the pop cards. The Hollywood Hotel shows the appearance of Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Paige and his orchestra in the film that the film industry was ready to exploit the shift in musical taste (the film was in production only one and a half years after Goodman's Palomar Ballroom engagement). There are a few interesting musical moments here and there in the Hollywood Hotel, but apart from Benny Goodman and his orchestra's "Sing, Sing, Sing", there is not much to praise. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and "Let it be a lesson to you" production number at the run-in restaurant. The film is most interesting to watch and hear Benny Goodman and his orchestral games and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
