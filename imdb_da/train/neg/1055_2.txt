* Spoiler warning! <br /> <br /> First of all, I rated this movie 2 out of 10. The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the movie, failing to do the psychic drama it could have been. First of all, she never fights alone. After a first very strange doubt from his mother (who is not credible when the mother turns out to be so supportive and loving later in the movie), the rape victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive, always falling into Crew's strange traps. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly ugly. What I find most incredible is that Ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is a lot of leaders of Crew (hi, they say it themselves) and people seem to believe the other guy is a jerk, but when Ethan changes his mind, he just fails to convince a single person in Crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why ?? The film gives no explanation. How did he ever become a leader? <br /> <br /> A funny note is that my boyfriend thought I was seeing Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same successful TV series .... a cheap way to get viewers?
