"Cat's Meow" contains a couple of scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some fine performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as author Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (although movies never use her real life, it's hard to explain). But these elements do not add up to a successful whole. Screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes - the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly suitable - but not so hard on the big picture. Several smaller characters do not have to be there and do not behave consistently. The plot is filled with illogical (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really doesn't want to hear?), And the party scenes are repetitive and tiring. I would like to think that a trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type, which is not very accurate, and the manuscripts' ideas of Chaplin and love are impossible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed to be so associated with the thirties in "Paper Moon", lacks a similar affinity for the thieves. He insisted on the excellent costume designer using only black and cream, giving the party guests a very artificial look and playing only the most stereotypical songs of the period (eg "Yes, we have no bananas"). When Hearst insists on all "Charleston, Charleston!" It looks like the actors had a 10 minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> The lives of quiet movie stars can make fascinating movies, but I'm sure, but not this time.
