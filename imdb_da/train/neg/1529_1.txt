If you see this turkey listed in your TV guide, AVOID WHAT THE PLAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> A steamy pile of fat dinghies kidneys doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one fun scene (memory eraser scene), but even only the .001 rates on the laughometer (out of 1000). Anyone who wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire life.
