The small California town of Diablo is plagued by mysterious deaths after Sheriff Robert Lopez emits an old box. Legend has it that the box holds the Mexican demon of the sixteenth century named Azar. The FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and associate with the sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary, to battle with evil and bloodthirsty demon. "The Legend of Diablo" is an absolute garbage. The film lacks scare and make, the play is amateurish and the direction is bad. The animation is the only aspect of the movie I enjoyed. I'm a big fan of indie horror flicks, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bonesickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a huge misfire.Definitely one to avoid.
