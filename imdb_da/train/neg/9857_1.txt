I just finished watching this movie and I just didn't find it funny. <br /> <br /> I'm a RPG Gamer (computer type, no DnD tabletop stuff), but I didn't find any jokes fun at all. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to pull out a lot (tilt and zoom could have been cut to 5 seconds instead of over a minute) and it feels like the director was I just trying to fill the time. I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The action itself wasn't that bad, about the standard that a B Grade movie should have. <br /> <br /> I would suggest you do not bother this movie unless you are a big DnD fan and even then it would be best to remove it.
