I saw most of "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC New York Film Festival and had to leave the theater because of nausea in me. I've seen Bollywood movies and I've seen the satires from Bollywood movies. This movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke on itself. It seems to have been liberally copied from films like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a dull, lazy job on it. How can Bollywood ever be rejected by its willingness to stick to overused, well-visited scripts? Is there no one who can put on the screen the millions of real, fascinating stories that certainly exist and display in the countries of a billion people? The over-smart auto driver, the cow on the street, free scenes foreign places, pointless scenes in Mumbai streets, they are all in there. All possible clich√©s about India have rightly been included. So poorly predictable. UH !!! Trading performances are weak across the board except Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why she would choose a project like this.
