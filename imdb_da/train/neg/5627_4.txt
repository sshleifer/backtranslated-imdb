As I see this movie, it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men. The movie uses its time to show how powerless the most visible black man is (save for a heroic moment). Too much of the movie is the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film far out in the background, hardly visible. Vanessa Williams' character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional supporting characters that are light-skinned and some white characters with some warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. Voiceless shadows in the background, without consequence. Such a terrible mistake, but anything but unusual in the ordinary media.
