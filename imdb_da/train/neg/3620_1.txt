I was trying to see this abomination of the cinema when I was five years old; I've never been the same since. Filled with the brim of drug-induced images, which goes beyond the ordinary ravings of your average asylum, this "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, especially children. <br /> <br /> It starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who destroys his classroom drum of (wait for it) to put his head through it; Yes, put his head through it. But don't be afraid, my friends! He is quickly comforted by his chirping flute, which is odd enough to give you, but still acceptable. <br /> <br /> So: The movie morphs into a combination of Wizard Oz and where the wild stuff is, but loses all the "hot and fuzzy" aspects of one of these two books. <br /> <br /> So this seven-foot yellow relative of Barney is kind to this poor boy and throws him even deeper into despair. <And to add the cozy selection of horrible themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the modley crew member of hobbling grandfather bells and doped "dragons," is added to the mix of chaos. </ br /> <br /> The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain who is the appropriate "Ditchiepoo" (?). Of course, she herself has problems: What about an obvious plastic mask that limits her facial expression to having to deal with a diet tip whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest in the most inconvenient moments. As a result, one of her favorite pastime was nasal diving in the body of the water separating Pufnstuf's land from her degenerate, overdue home (I don't know where I would have preferred to live). <Br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see the movie that has similar effects on the audience like The Exorcist, then this is for you. Enjoy.
