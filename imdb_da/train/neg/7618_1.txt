This is not a cinema. It's not talent. It's not informative. It's not scary. It's not entertaining. It is nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin says, "Diablo! COOL!" Yeah right. The only thing that was fun about this experience was the only fact that I didn't buy it, but rented it instead. It's shot like a bad soap opera. No waiting. Soap operas at least LOOK professional ... sorta. This? It looks like it was shot with a person's video camera. It's terrible! Miserable! It sux. <br /> <br /> Kinematics are abominable! WHO is this instructor anyway? I don't even like enough to look him up. He STUNKS! The performance of these poor unsuspecting actors was far better than this crap party deserved. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It records a 0.3 / 10 on the "A" scale from ... <br /> <br /> Enemy :.
