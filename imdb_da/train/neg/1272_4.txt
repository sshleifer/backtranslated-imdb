If others have noticed when they are in the car every time the camera takes a new angle, they change paths. Like in a scene, it is a one-lane home with sidewalks, next they are on a number of highways with a partition wall, next a two-way road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget, but it was just sloppy film work. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you can enjoy this movie. However, if you find his work / not fun, then I recommend to stay away from this.
