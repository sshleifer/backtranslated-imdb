A slow, boring and one-dimensional movie! Good casting with clich√© dialogue, boring history and rare direction from Marshal! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent lacks heart, new insight, and depth. The protagonist looks out of place because of her little phisique and fake-looking contact lenses. The lexicon used by the geishas sounds compelled and slightly too sophisticated for their limited exposure to training. The story goes on and on for several hours trying to convince you of this tiny, boring, flat-knit Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha, they actually say in the movie "She's destined to become a legend," I say it's hard ! The movie is just boring, it's beautiful to look at, it has a very few interesting moments, as many as you can find out of cigarettes. Basically, if you do not believe in messenger, you will not believe in the message and this girl did not fill the shoe! Borin, boring, skip it!
