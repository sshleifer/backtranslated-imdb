Make no bones about it. There are many things wrong with this movie. It is cliched all the way, not very fun, predictable and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: characters. There is the dull, unfortunate guy who gives Stiller another notch in his dull, unfortunate lap belt - the supposedly wild, but really just quite normal, loves the interest - who Aniston plays well, but really didn't need any effort to do it - the cool, jovial friend and then the assortment of clich√©s: an annoying daredevil Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The story: The beginning is a bit unusual, but then goes into the standard one movie style where each plot becomes as predictable as your average knock-knock joke. The biggest problem was that Scaffold's character "development" really seemed to come from nothing - like your average school play, the authors knew where he started and where he ended, but didn't make enough stock to properly tell the middle. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing but very dilute versions of standard coarse humor; there was a regulation of acting, sweaty fat men, etc. In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word shart was the only good thing. Hamburg has really smeared a dog's dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have lured the viewers, but the taste left in the end was just as crazy. <br /> <br /> Final comment: This movie may have been horrible, but Aniston still opted for a better inter-Friends-Seasons movie than Kudrow's malicious "Marci X".
