I disagree much with what has been written and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are major flaws in simple exhibition, in the basic communication of critical plot points that about Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the man agreed, rather than substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and regain his wife until Oswald was dead? 2) The end is very unsatisfactory because it is arbitrary and unintentional. The original manuscript called Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will when she found out that her husband had actually sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a suicide movement. Mary is then summed up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-defeating and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks to force the public towards the private, political personal. Contrary to what the critics and "experts" claim, I do not think it works. Starting historical historical news or the sound of German reconstructions in the soundtrack of dramatic events in the film does not integrate these historical events into the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is supposed to parallel the so-called economic miracle in post-war Germany. Mary is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in fact unoriginal and unspecific. Women have claimed their independence by using sex for self-development for years. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several instances of inexplicable sleep and amateurity - Fassbinder's drug abuse and thus impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people speak outside the screen without being seen; music is clumsy in places; and melodramatic setup occasionally replaces to act. <br /> <br /> Strangely, for a film condemning a country for intentional collective amnesia of the Holocaust, it never mentions it once.
