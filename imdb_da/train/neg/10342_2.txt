Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the screen's most incredible couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction awakens uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks it's the first, and his self-centered performance in a minor role emphasizes the total lack of balance and chemistry between the film's players. Usually I don't like letting myself be so ascerbic, but The Bell Jar is one of my all-time favorite books, and to see what they did with it, I literally make crazy.
