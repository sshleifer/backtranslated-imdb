In principle, you take the concept of any Asian horror ghost movie and smash it in one and you get this movie. The story goes like this: A bunch of college kids get voice mail from their own phones that predict their deaths. There are some ghosts that, if you've seen any Asian ghost film, aren't scary now. This film was quite disturbing because it is very cliché. It's the same bullcrap, another movie. <br /> <br /> The action was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are in a very ring-esquire situation, so that is nothing we have not seen before. The two main actions, however, did a solid job. <br /> <br /> There is not much going on about Gore. We get a cool sequence that includes an arm that turns a head off (I don't know how to explain it otherwise), but it was cut away so you can't see anything but the final result. You can see some blood at times, including assaulted arms and a zombie (which looked really cool I could add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> Screams in the movie are few and spread out, and it's really not that scary. You get some scary pictures at times, but it's not enough for me to consider scary. It's nothing but Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and neither of them frightened me either. It's really fallen into this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it doesn't deliver the scares then it's just not as good. <br /> <br /> Regarding governance, Takashi Miike still did a pretty good job. He seemed a little emptied of this movie compared to his previous films, but he still portrays much of his shaky style he has become famous for. Many pictures were much like Miike (including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses), and the last 15-20 minutes seemed much more Miike and the rest of the movie. Nevertheless, the film is erroneous by its non-originality. I would only recommend this to people who are big on Asian horror movies (though you are, I can recommend much better) or great Miike fans. Warning to those who want to enter Miike, this is NOT his best work. I give it a 4 because it's just mediocre. Maybe if this was released 4 or 5 years ago, it may be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> I also want to b **** about Asian horror movies really fast. How come, if it's an Asian horror movie, is it automatically supposed to be good at home (USA)? A lot of these movies are the same in Japan for what Scream, Urban Legends, and I know what you did last summer was here in the 90s. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. And many of these movies rely too much on scares and imagery that if they don't deliver the scares they set out to do then they just aren't that good and nothing would change it. More Asian horror films should be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films, that if they don't scare or scare you, they have at least good stories, plays, direction, filmography, and more to back them up. Two films that are not only big horror movies but good movies in general. Several Asian horror movies should be like these instead of the cliché: "A ghost would just be found so it went around killing people through their phone / video tape / house / electrical appliance / water pipe / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc."
