Liongate has not yet proven itself. Every single movie from the lions gate has been abysmal. I have tried and tried to give them more options and they just keep relaxing me over and over again. And Cabin Fever is absolutely no exception. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie, it was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Guy cuts dead dog for some reason. If infected by random virus, it transfers to children in a camp, children begin to get infected and die, the city finds out and instead of helping them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> It's all the movie seriously. All the characters are completely retarded, you don't care about any of them, and one child must be stuck with the boy meeting the world. My friend and I found out about how fat and bitch our one classmate should be much more fun than paying attention to this movie. We managed to do it all the way to the end while screaming bullies $ @ t because this movie will make you do it. <br /> <br /> And I'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moving One random child and how apparently everyone in the country is completely retarded and hiccups. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why did the baby try to kill the hicks in a chair and wait for them to kill him? It was part of their two plans? wow. best plan ever. I can't believe this movie got a theatrical release. I could hardly belly the DVD, let alone sit in a theater that doesn't move for an hour and a half. It wasn't scary or fun or cool or anything. It's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could use for ... I don't know, plant a tree or something. It is more productive than this piece of waste. The action, special effects and script is a joke. Never pick it up here. <br /> <br /> Cabin fever gets an eerie bone touch scene, out of 10
