I don't want to say that this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was quite old-fashioned. In every step of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl is burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /> <br /> Even though they are engaged, they must allow each small move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was cot madly. <br /> <br /> Hello, we also have children, but we don't see them and always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream come true. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father, and now it's the other way around. And I knew somehow that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I think I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
