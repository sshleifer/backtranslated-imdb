Very incredible, incredible and incoherent Spanish production about ... let me see just how close I can get to it. The film opens with a woman who has one of her cat killed by a young girl. She asks her love to take her somewhere on her vacation. He calls work and requires him to lose his vacation time, and she says he will pay for this. What relevance this plays out is that someone guesses at the end of the movie, because the guy, a black photographer, spies a beautiful Patty Shepard, queen of Spanish horror movies, it seems to take her bikini top of cards so he can snatch one picture, ask her out for lunch and then to his job at Witches Mountain - for reasons again we are never used to. Before they go, Patty has to stop at the house and loudly "scary" chanting echoes in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues that the two stop at an inn, move on to the mountain and finally realize why the mountain is called Witch's Mountain. You know there are several aspects to this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has a certain atmosphere, some of the character actors are really pretty good (especially the deaf man and the old woman), the leaders are at least adequate, and the climax - even if it doesn't make sense - is well-choreographed (literally) with the witches in white brasseries and long black hair. However, it just makes no sense and it is a huge propensity to me. I could see the movie another ten times and still not know more now than I did after the first show. It's a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious movie from the long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror films covered by that decade. If you can get more from it than me, better power for you.
