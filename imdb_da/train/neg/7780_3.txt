I could hardly keep from nodding or just turning off this turd, but I decided to keep it out if it was just why maybe * something * would happen. This is a work by a writer / producer / instructor / special, eg Kenneth Herts, who will comment on organic damage while making a monster film. It was anyway he wanted. What it turns out to be a lot of plays, either a little hammy or just everyday and without much profit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what happiness does a woman just wear naked in it ... even though there have already been baffles!) <br /> <br /> These are just obscene things, but I guess it's not too harmful; it is not least extremely uncomfortable and once or twice we get a semi-interesting look at Brazilian "culture" (which is the danger that goes through the city with its bunch or other pieces of a vengeance of 'hi, it's not America!') . But regardless of the hope that the director had in throwing Mitchum, or Carradine was wasted on best pedestrians and, in the worst case, scary banal and stupid dialogue. It does not help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the "action", it is also stupidly staged and with only a little appeal. Normally, I would be saddened by a filmmaker who had a lot of trouble getting a certain picture finished - in this case it got better out of the mid-70s, but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it's called ... nah . <Br /> <br /> If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double function of this (bad print with poor transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to skip it. Unless of course you are an Elvira die-hard and can't help yourself to hearing his delicious comment; Personally, I'd rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from the Mystery Science Theater on this fried turkey.
