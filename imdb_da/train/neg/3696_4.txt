Normally, I would have given this movie a 6. It tackles a very important issue and it does pretty well - despite Katie Wright, who is a performance in itself. <br /> <br /> I don't know if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally annoying, but she did a great job of making it impossible for me to look after Lexi. There is no dimension to her other than how confused, helpless and clueless she is and how good she is scaring. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has sprouted out of control would be confused, scared and painful. However, Wright's overall performance is based on incessant scorn and snail, the rest throws. I couldn't help but feel that this particular girl's problem was not caused by the demon who is Bulimia but because she didn't have the backbone. I doubt very much that the film is supposed to do.
