I can't say this is the worst movie all the time, but only because there are still some movies I haven't seen yet! This must be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie at all times! The director suffers from the same problems he had with "There Will Be Blood" (although he wasn't as bad in that movie. The whole movie feels like you're looking at a guy trying to hard to impress his It's like he's sitting in his little director's chair thinking "how would a great filmmaker handle this scene?" He just doesn't have it in him. I don't know if this movie could be saved by a great filmmaker. The nuggets of grandeur that could have been polished, but nothing was taken in. The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history, one by one as we see the signs singing and I jumped in my seat I continued to say "thank you, just don't have the guy on the verge of death song too!" Sure enough, massive mistake!
