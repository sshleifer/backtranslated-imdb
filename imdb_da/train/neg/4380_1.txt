Plot: An amorphous couple decides to get involved in some extra-married haninks in a flashy car. They become so stuck (literally) in a compromise position, while that car strives effortlessly on the landscape until the effortless couple is rescued by the authorities. <br /> <br /> That's it. It's the whole movie. There may have been a dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be obvious now that this film is not only meaningless but actually physically painful to see. The fact that it played two of Britain's best up-and-coming actors (one of which is unfortunately killed) adds only to horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson was excellent in the much-deserved Oscar-winning "Wagons". Let's remember him for that role and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloid abomination has never happened.
