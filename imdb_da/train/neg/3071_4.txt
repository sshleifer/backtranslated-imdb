I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (fortunately) or it would have been a painful experience. I got tickets for prevleven for free, but it was still not worth my time or my friend. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that old people have a past before they became old (no fun). The protagonists' lives were painful to see, a generation no better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. But I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to counter the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.
