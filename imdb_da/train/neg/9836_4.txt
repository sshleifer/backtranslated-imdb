John Scott (John Wayne) and collaborator Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are trailers going to Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a fair contestant, but finds that unless he is willing to accept twenty-five cents on the dollar in prize money from a curly promoter, he must collect his winnings at the rifle point. Randomly, the bandits decide Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) that they would like the rest of the rodeo; they shoot promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killings. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a continuous gag in the movie where they are about to go with their fists over various trivialities. Every time Chandler takes a wild turn, Wayne's foot sticks him and knocks him silly. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, there is a nice Lipton Tea ad in one of the scenes where Scott's love interests Anne (Mary Kornman) appear. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, the buddies are framed once again over a scene abber. To have a change of heart and see the error in his ways, evil guy Jim will come clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him down. Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne marches right into the middle of a war field between the good guys and the bad guys to confront the sheriff. "The Desert Trail" is one of the mixers John Wayne Westerns from Lone Star Productions in this era. Oddly absent is George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both are usually seen in these oaters. If you are a John Wayne fan, however, you should see it once, but it will probably be enough.
