This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the hour and a half, I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. It went slowly, the plot ran around, it wasn't scary or interesting, and it was never really something. The credits during the introduction were long and pulled out, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and pulled out). Many parts of the plot had no meaning. Several times during the film I thought I might have "zoned out" because the plot's disagreement, but my companion had the same problem and assured me that I was not "zone out" from boredom, but it was actually the movie. In fact, I have never been here on a movie before and have been actively watching movies on IMDb for many years. So the fact that I actually take time to write something must talk about how bad this movie is, and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
