Why Review Good Movies When You Can Browse "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is sooo lame. I can only see the picture and the crew running around L.A. With a video camera, extras in the silly monster make-up in the poor, Tim Thomerson suffers. The stars' families have actually come up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon could not afford "real" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so amazed it would take eons to loosen all the knots - this should be classic trancers! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... it rules. Note this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV." I say it because it's true. What can beat, see an old guy in a trench coat, knock down zombies, bust out with quips like, "Don't worry about ladies, they're biodegradable"? Well, many things could be better, but still good things. My only important reservation is Megan Ward, who really encounters the link. She is a miserable rival for Helen Hunt's character - they are both young pieces of eyewear, and it would have been more effective if they actually opposed a little more. Oh yes, you can't have everything. At least, the wonderful plot unit of the "long secondary clock" is back in place, and we have more of Hap Ashby, the least compelling athlete in the history of the cinema (oh wait a moment - he has a rival in the form of David Ogden Steir's in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it lately, but I seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice in the last match. Hooray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many highlights of this fine film.
