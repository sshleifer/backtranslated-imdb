The herd is not really a movie. It's a wannabe movie with wannabe actors. Not included Richard Gere, he did an excellent performance, but when only one of the actors really does, and the rest of the cast just works ... the result is pathetic, like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are acting. What the hell did Claire Dains do in this? She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film, she looked extremely out of place, out of everything !! The only thing she did was ask stupid questions like "do you really think so?" And do stupid faces. I was embarrassed by her action, seriously and I used to like her ... She's the romantic movie type, I don't know who has picked her up from all the actresses out there .... LOL and watch Avril Lavigne? this really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want the feeling of throwing up, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote -5 ..
