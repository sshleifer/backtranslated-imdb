There are some good shots in this movie, it captures some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light. In fact, cinematography is probably the best asset. But it is basically more of a made for television movies, and although it has many twists in the plot that keep it quite interesting to see, there are no subtitles, and key plot developments have been revealed in Spanish, so non-Spanish speakers will get a little lost. <br /> I had it as a Santa Claus gift, as it is a family move to work through an actor movie, we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just amazing in "A Time to Kill" and "The Newton Boys "so I stated that I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> But while on the DVD box, it is a Matthew Mconaughey movie and uses this as a marketing game, it has a few lines and is on the screen for not much minutes at the end of the movie, he is basically an extra, and he does not exactly illuminate the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, re ally not worth it from that point of view. <br /> <br /> The movie star however, Patrick McGaw is big and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he would be well-written in a ROM com . <br /> <br /> So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of those I've seen, I'd recommend "A Time To Kill" The Newton Boys "" Frailty "," How to Lose Guy in 10 Days "," Edtv "and" Amistad "and also avoid" Greater than life "and" Angels abroad "unless you fancy a children's movie or have children around, since none of these are signs of his talent, but are quite funny movies to kids, again MM is really nothing more like a supportive artist with a few if any lines. <br /> <br /> As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad movie, but neither is the screen stealing either.
