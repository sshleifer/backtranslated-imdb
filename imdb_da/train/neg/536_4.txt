The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts on her past. Flashbacks is about a weekend where young Ann is in the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding, she meets Harris, who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs in her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more "responsible", a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from girlfriend to girlfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life. First of all, the good. The period detail in the film is great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses etc. Really puts you in a different time and place. And there is something very quality that works in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the protagonist and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a good job as a protagonist when she was young (and she is an excellent singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to Lila's brother Buddy's character. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad ones, unfortunately, everything else. Things are constantly interfering with the story as it unfolds for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is fantastic. They have fun and dancing. Then you have to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his torment only irritates her. And I thought it all, "he could be gay" things were out of the blue and didn't serve any purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character seems woody and scary. Had it been another genre, you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from that time. It is an incredible touch to believe that all these girls loved him so (but they portray the other guys so beautifully to try to help him out). And the biggest problem for everyone. Why don't Ann and Harris come together? They fall to each other. They have this lovely nightmare in an old dirty gardener's cabin, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then ... Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet a few years later and get everyone misty eyed about each other and I couldn't fail to wonder why. WHY? The movie doesn't tell you why they were forced to marry other people, and I had a hard time getting sad. <br /> <br /> The part of the story in the present is pretty boring. The cliché good daughter and the cliché bad daughter. Nina changes over the movie, but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the daughters associate with old Ann's dreams, she is hunting a butterfly. It's really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> There is no error, please consult with us. The statement does not really speak with history. And it doesn't sound true after watching the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.
