I'm never much into classic movies. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, Where Green was my valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane carried me. But I'd much rather see any of these movies 3,469 times while tied up on a chair than seeing an American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the latter, I'd probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> The color scheme and music didn't interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. The dance and song could help with a sleepless fall to sleep. The dialogue does not match Singin 'in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I slept only 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (too bad we can't give zeros.)
