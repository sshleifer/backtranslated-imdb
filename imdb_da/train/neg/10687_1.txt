End Game started well, at least to say the end the better. Things seemed to happen just to keep the plot through, for example, the reporter, who is initially a very curious, intelligent person, halfway doing something really stupid and out of character, we get no reason for it except it would The next scene doesn't make sense without it. The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have made an average television political drama. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. are very attentive, and James Woods is considering an admirable work. The end game was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...... and that says something I've seen Gigli.
