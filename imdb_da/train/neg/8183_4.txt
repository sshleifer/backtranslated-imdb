This is a pretty pretty fluff part about WW II codes being broken, stolen, etc. The action is about what I expected from this cast of MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> Great caution. Jean Rogers, who did a great job of playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon series, is just awful in this movie. Her character is extremely annoying. She never welcomes her exaggerated action. We would believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a Top Secret code facility, she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office she chose, even if she had no official function. From that point of view, I am sorry that I have ever seen this movie. It has forever changed my perception of Mrs Rogers. Talent wise she is extremely easy. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his usual self, meaning he is only sufficient. <br /> <br />
