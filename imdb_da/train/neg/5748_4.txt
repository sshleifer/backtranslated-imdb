I must say I hated this movie. I don't like to say it because Gerard Butler is in it. In a half-hour boring conversation, everyone who actually cares about the plot, regrets that I quickly sent to Gerry's scenes. I really don't know the end, I was sorry. If Gerry wasn't in it, I probably did either one of two things: fell asleep or turned off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie as he is with most of his previous films. If you are a fan of Gerrys, then you are not worried that he is as sweet and precious as he is always, but if you actually want to see the movie for the plot, good luck because you need it, whether it or many coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the casting director made sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea how to spell his name!
