The film is never unacceptable to watch. And to tell it straight, it has nothing to show either, except perhaps party-sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing straight-sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see in both ways. There is no excitement, little action, unimpressive dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boring places, and very bland. Kevin Dillon is completely worthless. Silverstone ... I didn't focus too much on her, I confess. But as I said earlier, if you have nothing to do except to watch a movie, it doesn't look so bad. 4.10
