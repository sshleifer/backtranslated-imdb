I know that in this episode there are other things apart from what I should discuss, and I actually think it has some virtues. For example, we get to see Jin's side of things and get a new and more balanced understanding of his life after we got a very negative opinion from Jin from watching Sun's flashbacks in "The Rising Suns House". <br /> <br /> However, there is one element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the entire episode. Before, it had been suggested that Sun's father was a person rich in shady and illegal methods in the scene where Jin performed blood on his hands and shirt. Maybe I thought he was a mob boss himself; Mobs operate in Korea, as in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable opportunity. In this episode, however, we learn that the sun's father is actually the head of a Korean car company and that what Jin had done was physically attacking an official (who was actually supposed to be murdered) on his behalf. <br /> <br /> I can pay particular attention to this because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say that SPECTACULARLY is aggressively and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing continues in Korea; The big, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model of this fictitious car company as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these mafia-like methods rather than any normal West car company. It's just incredible to me that the authors would have gall to write something like that in history and that there has been no revolt in Korea over it. It feels like strangers "Buy American!" propaganda displaying foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy third-country apparel.
