Wow this movie sucked great time. I heard this movie expressing the importance of friendship very well. And with all the internet hype on this movie I figured out what could go wrong? But the movie was just pretty bad. It was boring and the character development was never there. Space Travelers was also a horrible movie, if you didn't like the movie, there is no way you would like this.
