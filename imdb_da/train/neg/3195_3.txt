Two Qualifiers Right Ahead: In fact, I think Joe Don Baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right instructor ("Cape Fear" remake, a small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And I even liked Baker in "Mitchell" because he played an anti-hero who was SUPPOSED to be unlikeable. Yes, the MST3K cover was fun, but they took many cheap shots at Baker - which he didn't deserve - to keep things alive and entertaining - he was appropriate for the movie's level and tone, and he was the best part of the movie. "Final justice" seems to be more of the same, but despite exotic places and the "cowboy border justice" theme, it is rather weaker than "Mitchell". And the main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is an idiot. The film has the impression that because Baker designs old-style borders machismo, he challenges his opponents to old-style mano-a-mano fast drawing competitions. And because he's so hard and macho, he always wins, even when he's hurt, wounded, overall, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a concept with many options (it worked for Gary Cooper), even though it condemns the movie to "B" movie status. But Baker is so stupid and obsessive that he unnecessarily challenges three of the evil lords' henchmen to a showdown in a public market with civilians everywhere. He could just have shaded them at the main comrade's headquarters (that's why he followed them in the first place) and they would never have noticed. Or he might have got the drop on them and forced them to surrender, and got one of the handlords to take him to the headquarters at the gun. But no, he must be a bush league hotdog and a macho blockhead, and then he gets a child taken as a hostage in the subsequent shootout! <br /> <br /> This is a guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is pretty much like this. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (the craftsmen) who are pretty good (the top bad guy and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they just go through the moves but they are benefits and even hamming it up are decent). But on the whole, Baker's character pulls stupid, unproductive stunts and bugs that get at least two relatively innocent people killed, plus a couple of bad ones who may have been alive without the use of lethal force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, since 90% of the film is set in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you will see lots of beautiful scenes and lots of fine and exotic great extras. And really, Baker himself can be on the heavy side and a little dyspeptic, but he's not that bad ... certainly not the tub that these movie critics (including Mike and Bots in their hilarious cover) seem to think. <br /> In short, this movie is good for video loss, but the viewer should not be aware of it.
