One of the "movies coming in age" that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids. This movie has neither. It's a bad excuse to let Sylvia Kristel's body double with a dorky Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is either stupid or stupid when trying to be fun, sexy or dramatic. Doing creepy as we were supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone to bury a dead woman in his yard. Consider why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double. When the movie went over and over again, I began to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic to the WKRP. Look at this to laugh at others' stupidity or at Ed Begley Jr.'s dedicated performance, or wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from movies staring at Sylvia Kristel, who is not Emmanuelle.
