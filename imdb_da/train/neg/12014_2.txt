A somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about the dangers of World War II. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia or not. The best act is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor became evil. He is the leader of a spy ring trying to get information from amnesiac Jane, coded information related to allied activities. Will she tell you? Can she remember that? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey. The role that John Garfield plays (like Dr. Lewis) is nothing short of catastrophic. He seems so mistreated that the casting must be placed as one of the worst in film history. It is unfortunate that so talented an actor is filled up in a role that does not suit his talents. The movie is worth a visit, despite being half a spy and a half gangster movie, and despite having a parade of stereotypical characters. It is easy to forget this, amnesia is not necessary.
