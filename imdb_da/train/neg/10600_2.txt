I'll be honest. The only reason I saw this on TV is that it is in the IMDb bottom 100. And right now I wonder if an hour and a half in my life was really worth another "check" on the same list. <Br /> <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds a big battle with the universal soldiers after the main computer has pulled a "HAL" to defend itself. And yes, after all the compulsory explosions, shootings and chases he is the last standing. Combined with horrible acting and a little boring setup, it sure is the place in the infamous list, just. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see the full list. 10.2.
