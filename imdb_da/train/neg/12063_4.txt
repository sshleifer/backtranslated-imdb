Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley's husband and wife were big stars in vaudeville, but they made very few films. As is the case for some other performing artists in their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible film to Fields and Seeley is the biopic about them portrayed by other actors: "Somebody Loves Me ", starring in Betty Hutton and the infinite song-and-dance guy Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another man and wife vaudeville act - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - achieved almost as much star as performing an almost identical act that effectively became "second-team" Fields and Seeley. Offstage, however, was a big difference in the couple's live events. Fields and Seeley lived in the hotel's suites, paid the room rate for each meal they ate and eventually run out of money. Block and Sully lived the message and invested their earnings wisely and ended in comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this Vitafon card are occupied by two worn pianists. Apparently, these two men had some small name value of their own in 1930, although I have never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start performing. They both have lots of pep and she's pretty attractive. I was annoyed that both artists continue to make moves as if they are breaking into a dance, but they never do it until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally begin to head, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was happy to have this opportunity to see these two great artists doing their vaude action. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never starred in movie musicals. My rating for this: just 4 out of 10, and I stick with Block and Sully.
