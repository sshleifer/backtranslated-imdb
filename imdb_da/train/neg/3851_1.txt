I never thought I was watching a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is famous", but it came pretty close. As often repeated through the comments, it was predictable; Five minutes in the movie you know that it will be stranded at the altar result. This film painfully refers to everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". Author Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs some new material. The only twist is the horrible girlfriend / police officer who is being pursued by internal affairs, but even that option is wasted. Plenty of setting pictures of the Seattle Space Needle needed to pamper the obvious Canadian shooting range. Some of the worst driving in the car scene with virtually no effort to hide the fact that the car is being pulled through the city on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or lower the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and the short haircut is a crime. $ 3M to Jason Lee, for what? Guess it beats skateboarding! So here's who to watch this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream' badly; People who can't get enough of Julia Stiles. 1.10
