The brain that would not die is a terrible piece of film that stinks from the opening credits. It has all the classic signs of being bad: unbelieveable plotline, horrible plays, low-grade sets and lighting. The plot goes like this: When a doctor and his fianc√© are caught in an accident, she is beheaded and he picks up his head and takes her to his laboratory where he puts his head in a pot with a special liquid that keeps it alive. I bet Betgnina Leath, who played the head in a pot, had to spend a lot of unpleasant time wearing the pot around her neck and chopping under a table. Nevertheless, the doctor tries to find her a new body and hires two strippers so she can choose one to have her new body. Poor all the way, so bad it was torn to pieces at the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
