I don't know why this behavior was ever tolerated in the movie industry! This movie (short) is gross (to say the least)! It's a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins, which act as adults (and too much so!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "the good old days" may not have been so good after all! (Thank you GOD, we have laws against this kind of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a card from "Shirley Temple Festival"}
