Before I watched this movie, I expected a fictional drama based on ideas from the book; Instead, it is the book, interrupted by dramatic scenes, illustrating the various "diseases". It didn't bother me much, but it prevented my enjoyment of the movie. A story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book that had been through the movie would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you want to base a movie on a psychology text, find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film draws on parts where it is a little more than a video encyclopedia of sexual psychology from the 19th century and would be completely unacceptable if it was not sexually in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us). Fortunately, there are several stories with actual character development that draw us in. <br /> <br /> But disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's sexual theories mostly went out. I hoped it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology that many still hold today. <br /> <br /> In the end, what have you got? A detailed catalog of a few fetishes and briefings, with some faintly interesting stories showing a few "sexual deviations" before they are cured. For most of the film, the film moves with a creep speed (and mood). And as a low budget film, of course, movies and plays are not exactly the top level. Although I was * happy with music, costume and decor. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie's subject was right up in my alley and I still feel it's a below average movie. It deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I felt very generous. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they aren't already interested in sexual fetishism.
