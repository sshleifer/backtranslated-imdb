This British movie is really awful and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though he basically sleeps in it. The thought of a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train ends up parked to the majority of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so it is not as if there is any danger to anyone either. In fact, this movie could be used in a movie class to show how NOT to make a tension movie. Genuine excitement is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters do not, a fact that apparently is not known to the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe that there is only one. After the first bomb is defeated, it feels like there is no longer any reason to watch the movie any more. But at the last minute, the villain who has no obvious motivation for his actions has revealed that there are two. We are also not sure when the bombs go out, so we do not even have a classic "ticking bomb" voltage sequence. A good 10 minutes or more is used to see Glenn Ford's French wife thinking of leaving him and then wondering where he is. She's so annoying that we don't care if she fits with him, so when she does, there's nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are pretty devoid of personality, and no one has any problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's boring and boring. Do not waste your time.
