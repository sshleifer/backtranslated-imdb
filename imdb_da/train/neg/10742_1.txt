I tried to sit through this bomb a long time ago. What a disaster. the action was horrible. There were some completely pathetic action scenes that fell flat like a leading balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the actors' reactions just did not ring properly. Probably a modern recast of Hitchcock's original "lifeboat". I think Hictcock would be turning circles in his grave at the very thought of it. from what i liked to suffer through, there is nothing convincing in this movie.it boasts a few semi big names, but they put no effort into their characters. But you know, to be fair, it was no mistake really. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion. LOL.it is possible that this thing ends up getting better while it goes together. But for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out. If you do not have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this stink / 1/10
