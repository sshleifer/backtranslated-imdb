I recently looked at "Lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with "Descent", although I have heard more negative comments than good from other movie friends with tastes as varied as mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to contrast how the unique nape of Rape Revenge film has evolved over the past 32 years, from the fullest "I Spit On Your Grave" to the fuzzy sensationalism of " Lipstick "for the tasteful handling of the problem in" The Accused. " But "descent", even though we make some important points, never gives us anything new in terms of revelatory meaning. No, "Descent" is so poorly crafted in terms of image and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it might hope to make --- a message that, when examined carefully, is not groundbreaking. <br /> <I knew pretty much that the plot went in. What I wanted to see was * the "descent" or degeneration of Dawson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario's, I was eager to see the teams stripped away and her psyche was slowly twisted ... you know the kind of depiction DeNiro brings to "Taxi Driver." Unfortunately, the script and the director / author's choice do not give any kind of credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became evident what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club jumping, drug use and obsession with great black stallion Adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a Q&A on the DVD, but this outing in Dawson's character is never credibly reproduced . We don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time, what she's after or why she does. The poor quality of the sound / video again does not help, but the sequence is just too awfully long and meaningless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the leading character created during the otherwise highly successful first action. When we get to the final, our interest has already declined. <br /> <br /> A success point that Dawson points out in Q&A is that at the end, "revenge" scene is pumped for retribution, so realize just how pronounced and ugly the reality is. Although it is certainly valid, it does not make the scene more exciting. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outpouring that crunches with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really shows Dawson's slow bursting material when she's lovely vivisects poor Francie Swift's prissy, discouraging dorm adviser. If several exposure scenarios such as this had been added, and several of the middle thirds were cut, we could have an interesting psychological study of the impact of meaningless acts of violence. Since the film is in the final cut, but all we get is what we have seen before, only in a more graphic representation. So what?
