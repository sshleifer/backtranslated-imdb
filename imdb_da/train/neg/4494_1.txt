*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> This will continue the whole movie on itself. First we meet a rogue program with the indication, we get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a delayed accent that speaks endless garbage, two "ghosts" who don't serve any real purpose and have no character whatsoever, and a lot of henchmen. Someone told me they are vampires (right out of Blade 2), but they are so undefined, I didn't understand. <br /> <br /> The funny accent guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as Oracle, only for far longer and far far worse. He has a simple point of cause and effect, does it, then continues to do it and do it until it becomes horrified and stupid. His last line before he goes away is comparable to Storm's "do you know what's going on with a toad ..." line in X men in levels of utterly boring baddness. Chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic clich√© and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing but what we expect the moment we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we get another Kung Fu match !!! WHY? Neo is supposedly the one. He can do everything. He has the ultimate power, and what he uses it for. King bloody fu all the time. And even though he can stop 1000 bullets, he is still cut by a sword and still makes a meal at 5 undecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see mind blowing forces. I would like to see him make the wildest, craziest, most insane thing to people because he can do everything. I got the same as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The fabulous car chase. It can't be bad. Now ... no it is not. It's just not what we've been bullied about, it should be. ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Everybody. So everything Wow has been taken from us, so all we get is a good hunting sequence with, guess what, a Kung Fu fight !!! OK, it's not Neo, but you would have thought he would have explained his closest friends about the reality of the matrix. At least they learned something. It is not hard. "Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what's happening to you in the matrix. It's not true. As long as you understand that nothing is right, nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> There you go. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the hunt isn't bad. It's never boring, and it doesn't look like 16 minutes. It is just so amazing. And still it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The ultimate climax for the movie is probably the worst imaginable. They have this complete plan involving three crews. They then only occasionally show between Morpheus's long, super preachy, monologue. To make matters worse, they never clearly define what this plan needs 3 teams. You know basically, but you don't know who does what, when, so when a crew goes down, you just don't care and you don't know how this will affect what's going on. <br /> <br /> I sum it up though it happens so Trinity can get back into the matrix to set up the end. That's the only reason for that. Which raises the question, why should they send 6 people originally? Trinity comes in five minutes by itself! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the Matrix center (so to speak) is handled as long. Ooohhh !!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths !!! Woooooo !!! It must have taken a lot of thought. Only now are they in a corridor, so the fight has no scale and is in a moment. Man, what a grand finale !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said was bad about Oracle and the foreign guy? Add them together and multiply it, that's how it's really awful the architect. The only reasonable potential for him is that he is creating the rocky climax. <br /> <br /> And then he blows it! Let's look at the opportunities he gives Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all humanity dies !!! Considering choice is something this movie is trying to explore it doesn't really give it a whole. If he had a choice to save mankind and miss the door or save the miss and kill mankind, there is the potential for inner pains and tensions. Also, with Trinity being mid-fall, the potential of a true cliffhanger would have made seeing the third more crucial. But no. He hasn't saved or saved the mission. Now, the very best of the original Matrix was that Neo died and then came back to life right at the end. The year it came out, everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was, they didn't notice The End of The Matrix made him see him Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me I would fall in love with one and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How could the whole world have missed how awful it was? <br /> <br /> So what does Wachowskis do in the sequel? Well, they make the end of the original look better. How? Well, by doing almost exactly the same again (only swapping characters), only so much worse, I think my fa and r keys would be worn out if I continued to write long before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It is a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really didn't want it, but it is. Poor in just as many ways. And to make matters worse, it's not a movie with not enough budget. It's not a movie with too short a schedule. It's not a movie that's been rushed out. It is not a movie where there is too much outside influence. This is exactly the movie that Wachowski has set out to do with Warner's fortune behind them. And that's what makes it so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it didn't have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defeating movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Undeniably. <br /> <br />
