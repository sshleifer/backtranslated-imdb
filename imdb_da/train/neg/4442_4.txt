I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian, but all those things were too much. Too much love for the music, too many parties, too much contrast between the protagonists' lovely life (come on, it's not so boring) and the city's aspect that the director shows. Everything looks too fake to me: the families, the relationships, the music, the "happiness". It simply sells a little taste of the fake Latin American culture. I have to be honest: did it seduce me a little, but who wouldn't be seduced by the fake life of good music, sex, and parties? I'm not that stupid: what kind of world is this where people don't suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness, and heart disease? I liked the scene with Caridide's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
