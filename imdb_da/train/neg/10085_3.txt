Why does every movie on Lifetime have such anemic titles? "An unexpected love" - ​​ooh how provocative !! "This much I know" would have been better. The movie is nothing special. Real people do not really speak as these signs do, and the situations are really hackneyed. The straight woman who "turns" lesbian seemed to be more slag than the lesbian character. If you want to see two hot women kisses in a very discreet way, enjoy this. Although it looks like it was written by someone who doesn't really come out into the world to observe people. Why do I waste time writing about it?
