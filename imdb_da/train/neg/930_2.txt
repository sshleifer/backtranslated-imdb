Some children are wandering in the mountains, and one of them enters a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiators. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and uses the rest of the movie to kill all the other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is just so utterly meaningless, it's madness. Here's a short list of things that don't make sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and find another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend screaming so they go back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 meters away! <br /> <br /> 2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl screaming (What 100 yards away?), but do not investigate because they are afraid they will get lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and a girl are wandering around and in about their 10th scene together, the girl informs the guy that the protocol no longer requires him to turn to professor. I mean, what ...? First, it is just a really stupid thing to say, secondly, he never called his professor in the first nine scenes they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl is attacking Demonicus and he stops her and tells her the part of his gladiator training taught him how to sow without killing. Um, yes, we have a little noticed that she is hurt and not dead because she is up and going. But thank you for the time bit of information. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is bound in Demonicus' lair and when someone tries to free her, she instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she sets you free, which would take about 5 seconds, you wouldn't have help. <br /> <br /> And it just goes over and over again. The whole middle of the film is used with the two idiots who are lost in the forest, so they fight, then they place a tent and ignore their friends so they wander around some more. It's just so damn boring and pointless that I turned off the DVD halfway through. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially those that get the bulk of the screen. Demonicus himself made me laugh every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scratching his face up to look hurt. He runs, or should I say scammers around as if he's gay. The special effects are comical, the play is mostly terrible, and nothing makes sense. All in all, this concept could have produced a cozy-looking film if they put more time and effort into it, get rid of the ridiculous dialogue, create characters with real cozy personalities, have some kind of logical flow to the action, and maybe even make Demonicus to a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this meaningless pile of rubbish that will kill you.
