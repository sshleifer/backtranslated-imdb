As I am from Hungary, I have heard many people say better and better things about Üvegtigris so far, but I actually do not understand the cause of all that hurry. <br /> <br /> I liked many points in the movie, some of the quotes really cheered me, but the stereotypical characters are present again, as in any Hungarian movie, and the story is also pretty boring. I liked the first half, but then I started boring, and then I found the whole movie just BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is good as always, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the others are just there ... do nothing. How many years still need to go to a good Hungarian movie ???
