Maybe not, but it is terrible. Even the fantastic throw can't save it. Okay, I admit it started out quite fun, but it seemed to go downhill as soon as they jumped the girls in the generals house. Bill Murray turned away from being a quick witted, humorous guy in an asshole shouting things on the street people who just weren't funny, it was as if he were trying too hard to be fun. His character stole a weapon (an RV? Come on ...) and end up being a national completely after invading another country, killing God knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. A good point is that this movie shows the US Army's inadequacy and incompetence and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, though inadvertently. In fact, I felt horrified that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released.
