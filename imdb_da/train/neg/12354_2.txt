Of course I didn't see 'GI Jane' without choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around my ex-girlfriends house. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses his credibility right away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course is not. The result of this is that the story is automatically bound by limitations, limiting the amount of humor (which does not exist) or entertaining action scenes, and soon becomes too serious. The film is therefore extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' fails where other action movies succeed, primarily because movies like James Bond, Dirty Harry and various others are bigger than life but never preach to being otherwise. They are escapism and therefore entertaining. 'GI Jane' tries to be right and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie from Ridley Scott, with a very non-credible story, unremarkable acting and the only reason to give it 2/10 Instead of 1/10, there's some of it technical work.
