William Hurt diver researcher ??? US agents running the survey abroad? The sick contaminated man kicks ass after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper misses and doesn't kill Hurt (just hurt him), but the other "kill" shot is dead? A waste of time. Comparing this fall as other reviewers are ridiculous. Oh, and at the end of the movie, they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands, with the exception of the "evil" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him "the handshake". What? BTW ... when did IMDb require 10 lines of text? I'm just stumbling here. Does this not just grow the content of reviews if you need x numbers of lines?
