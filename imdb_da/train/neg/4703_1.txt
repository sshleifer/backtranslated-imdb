"Show me your boobies!" is not fun, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think or hear it. I find it sad that Nick hyped this crap THIS MUCH, and then it's what we get, stupid little children who act like stupid adults. I know it's supposed to be humorous, but consider out there having cute little innocent girls in K and 1st class who can't wait to see this. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters won't see it. I would love to block Nick but don't have the heart at this time, but if Nick endures this kind of crap, I'll have to.
