For a science scare movie to work well, it must either be original or a very good story. This movie is neither. Sure there is a pseudo-original twist, because the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but it is a very small twist. There is the government conspiracy angle, the main character's main character who has personal experience ... And a real drawback to this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Although the sign is written to be someone who should be pitied, he is not. Without sin, the film is meaningless. The other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous. The subplotters are overdue and annoying. And the shameful thing is that the film is too flat to even be enjoyed as mock material. Make the movie a 45 minute card and it might be worth seeing.
