I first saw this movie in the Soviet Union, and many erotic scenes were simply edited by the Censorship Committee. But then in Poland in 2000 I saw it in a complete form. So what? The plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic disaster and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong, equal and fundamentally serious ladies. The men are now trying to fight for it, and then the whole pile of extremely stupid clich√©s - sex drives, constant masculine desire for sex, feminists who are shown as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but idiots are quite surely they don't), and so on. The priest though star Jerzy Stuhr is here wood and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats saying saying "I'm in the elevator with a naked chicken and I haven't done anything for her!". This was supposed to be a comedy, instead it turned out to be a vapid farce, full of predictable jokes and under-the-waist innuendos. Don't waste your time on it - it's just bad.
