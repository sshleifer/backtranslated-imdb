It is not the sound of bees, it is the effect caused by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, ill-acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep, I never know. The reason is simple ... 3 thoroughly unlikely morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. This is even worse if possible. > I really must be a masochist if I could see this whole movie without turning it off ... or killing anyone.
