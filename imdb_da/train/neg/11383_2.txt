This is a really horrible "B" movie. It is unclear and often embarrassing. The reason, the basic routine of "doing business", is almost non-existent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups from 1942, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group comes by default three minutes, the exception being Mills Brothers, who for one reason or another justified two numbers. Ann Miller can't dance to the last few minutes of the movie and she has a little to do, but stiffens her stuff in the midst of a patriotic propaganda barrier. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most interesting moment in the movie arose in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to be playing in a train that is in awkward positions. (In the deep south at that time, the band was separated in railway wagons as they traveled.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last minute of the film, trumpet / violinist Ray Nance hurries down the hall to the camera and makes an "uncle Tom", bugs his eyes and winds his head as Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is really sad. Some movies are best viewed invisibly.
