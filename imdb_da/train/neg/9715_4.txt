This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to "rubber gun squad" many years ago. The entire squad consists of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades with the standards of 2007. All Vietnam veteran characters they have ever had have proven to be the killer unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer and he was put on it by his white boss. The only Spanish murderer was a "racist" who killed another Spanish speaker to hit a Spanish-speaking street kid for a crime committed (of course) to two rich white children. What a lot of propaganda. Hi, scriptwriters: Minorities and poor people also commit murder. Only on this show are most murderers overcrowded. <br /> <br /> In addition, the arrest of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago is a joke. No reality DA will push for murder one because it means the state will get stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would do their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will only invoke them for involuntary violence and they will not earn one day. The only real old criminals going to jail are either organized crime or ex-Nazis, whose senior beliefs strengthen DA's careers.
