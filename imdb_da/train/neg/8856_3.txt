Lee hosted 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talked about cinematic werewolves. He said something that his only brush with lycantropy was The Howling II, then he asked, "The less said the better." In fact, he was right, as this movie may well be the worst in its entire catalog of screen performance. The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject. It was a movie that had to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers thought for some strange reason that even more campy followers were needed rather than what worked for the first time (see CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles away from the first on each front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch-white through most of the big scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie worth mentioning (okay, I'll also cite Ferdy Mayne). Lee looks embarrassing as he says inane dialogue and does ridiculous things (check out who ends up with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what is drinking this is, which is a little more obvious than the two leaders who leave America to come to Romania. The story is not really worth exploring here, and you can bet there is very little history worth mentioning when you need Stephen Parsons and his band Babel to play through much of the movie at the beginning and end with the terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here, and yes, she occasionally fights, we get that scene again and again and again - a proofreader said 17 times (I counted ten - but perhaps has been so boring out of my mind at that time). I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it is 1 to Lee and two to Mrs Danning's contribution. Yuck!
