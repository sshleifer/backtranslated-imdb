I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is bad and the action is bad. There were many problems that could have been portrayed in a better way, such as protesting against homosexual marriage or finding the cemetery. The show cannot be described as a comedy show as it lacks humor miserably. I should say that this show was hardly successful in destroying the life of the Muslim community. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first. I had my hopes high on this show, but I was a little disappointed. I still appreciate the CBC to put such a concept in front of the viewers. Anyway, I wish good luck for the future.
