(Spoiler's galore) This is a totally horrible movie. First of all, it has that guy from medium. I think he has made a career without playing super doting dads. It was OK the first time he was trying to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly made it again! And then it goes, this movie moves in horrible real time. At one point I started imaging it was days later until I was reminded that the story line was only the next day ... in the early afternoon still! I'm not really sure who this couple should be. First of all, they are presented as a Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a child. But they are running an old blue Volvo. These types stopped running Volvo's decades ago. Today they run Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they still didn't drive Volvo. <br /> <br /> Then there is Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a little magical Wendigo statue and tells him about his magic magic. C'mon ... we still make old Indian mysteries. Just to drive it home, they pan over every Indian statue in their tourist trap upstate New York City. American Indians are portrayed in a way not seen for decades in this movie! Oh, and about Wendigo. In fact, he is not the cause of horror. He doesn't kill the baby's father, who is the most horrible thing in the movie ... he's just killed by a regular hick with a riot and a high-powered rifle. Wendigo is only late in the film to avenge the guy who killed his father ... oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was so angry with father, maybe because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo must have been happy that Dad was killed ... but ... <br /> And then it goes ... abusive, boring and indecent. There is no need to watch this movie at all.
