This show was horrible. For a George is not fun, and his kids are snob small brats. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Spanish speaker, I am very offended by this show and the way the characters are depicted. <br /> <br /> Plus the dysfunctional family thing has been done to death. For once I will see something original. What makes this show fun when other shows have done millions of times? I thought ABC would come to the senses and pull this piece of garbage out of the air, but unfortunately we have to stomach this until they "skip the shark". In my opinion, they already did.
