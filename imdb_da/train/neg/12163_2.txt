Completely worn slasher film does not have a redemption quality. It has Camp Advisor Angela (Pamela Anderson .. as the killer, her quips when she's wasted people are not even fun) on warpath killers who seem least creepy or oppose her speech for good behavior. We run the tip for boring, clich√©-dead kills, as slanting in the neck, for a child looking for his Freddy glove glove, a child who gets a chainsaw, a girl being drilled, one being squeezed into crapper (filled with leeches ), one that is burned, etc. It doesn't have an original idea to offer and is just a waste of time. It's unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen (who plays Ally) tits. Most of the violence takes place off-screen so even that will not satisfy.
