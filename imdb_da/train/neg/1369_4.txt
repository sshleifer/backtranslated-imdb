Amy Heckerling's second movie Johnny Dangerously is a parody of the 1930's gangster movies made in Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a medieval gangster looking back on his life with hard blows when he catches a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continued health problems so Keaton falls into a early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime master to Boyle and Keaton eventually runs through the series. Joe Piscopo has a fun trip like Danny Vermin, yes that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother became district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife and Marilu Henner play Keaton's minor. The movie looks cheap cheaply, so it seems like a TV show instead of a theater movie. The movie begins amazingly and then lowers as expected after the first half hour. Because of the combination of dialogue and gags, the film keeps its own in the first half, but then it quickly loses steam and goes down in mediocrity and vulgarity in the other half. Keaton hides the landscape with his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only unpleasant, not fun. Piscopo does "once" for many. Several supportive players are trying to keep the fort up as the pavement like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half develops into a hit or miss TV show type tone and never recovers. The final scene that utilizes The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as is the Call of The Wild Clark Gable movie seen in a tent earlier in the movie. I think Heckerling should have known better as the target audience would certainly pay attention to The Roaring Twenties' actual 1939 release date. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
