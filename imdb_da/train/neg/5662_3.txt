When I read most of the other comments, I felt they were too glowing for this movie. I found it completely lost spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen it's often best to just let things be. I totally agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer comparing FIRST Star Trek movies to the original series --- millions of tense fans waited and waited and waited for the show's rendition and were forced to see a bland and sterile approximation of the original. <br /> <br /> The reason is sometimes incomprehensible, it's terrible gory (though the recent New Zatoichi of Beat Takeshi is much more bloody) and lacks the heart of the originals. I have nothing against the blood at all, but some may be off (especially the cut nose and cut heads). Moreover, the time has not been good for Ichi - he seems like a broken and sad man in this movie (much more than usual) - and that's something fans of the series might not really want to see. <br /> <br /> This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi movies, this one is very clear. See one of the previous versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version.
