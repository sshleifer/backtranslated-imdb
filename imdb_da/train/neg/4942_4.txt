At any rate, each new line-up show deserves my "3 strikes and you're out" policy. I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, that is, 3 complete episodes. After episode 1, I actually said to the TV "Canceled tomorrow". It was so bad. I have now seen the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and have not yet managed a smirk. Not a look, a guffaw, a chortle, in fact no face movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by looking at all future episodes because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this show. I simply do not "get" it, but I think a comedy on a big TV network in prime time just needs to be fun; But there is no laugh from me. There is just no way that ABC would put the least fun comedy all the time at 8:00 am I know there must be an inside joke that just doesn't hunt with my brain. I've read each of the previous comments I "get" the social aspect of it, but where are the jokers ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a light bulb moment and hit my head and shout "Eureka".
