Kurt Thomas stars like Jonathan Cabot is a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game involving being chased by a group of ninjas, but these ninjas will not stand a chance, especially as Cabot is the gymnast! Taken as a whole Gymkata is a helluva bad movie, the thrilling spectacle, the God-fearing script and truly incompetent management makes quality under human standards, but this movie is so horrible, it really gets really fun. I mean by dialogue like "I know I want to wipe them out!" or "Ha !, your through!" Only add to the mock value that Gymkata gets more then. In addition, it is (wise) the only movie that has, hero a gymnast, who finds things to swing at the moment of heat.
