Elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to see this unfunny stink. Scene after stage director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less entertaining. Filled with unfunny deaths, trite gay characters and hack jokes, this movie is more desperate than entertaining. This is the kind of movie that makes a hope Kim Basinger follows Doris Day in early retirement. Let's remember her as she was (talented) and not what she has become. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents on every trip. The guy who plays Elvis looks more like Gomer than the King. The only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to see this movie at all is to look for Tom Hanks cameo. The cameo is not that fun, but at least it is not painful. One must wonder if Zwick has incriminating images of Hanks or something that would make him do this movie.
