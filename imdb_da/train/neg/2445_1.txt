Hey, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this site, but if you are a fellow of this movie: join the fan club! This movie was so incredibly bad I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a good way. Every clich√© ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it must be in the top 10 worst movies ever made.
