The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. Then it went from something that could be decent to some kind of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I couldn't stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that just stop and wonder if the whole role and crew just stopped caring at some point. What surprises me most about this movie is that it cost $ 22 million in the box office and cost only about $ 1.5 million to make. Congratulations on Lion's Gate for being able to pull one off.
