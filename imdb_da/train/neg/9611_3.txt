There are so many yummy things about this movie that I might not mention a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART's character: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it on. Boy does what 'Humphrey' sounds good.) 2. His long curly hair and silly sideburns. 3. His Black Bart get-up, complete with spurs! 4. Not sure which shade of lip gloss they have given him, but it's not too flattering. CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick doesn't make him any favors either. 2. The man is swallowed by his hat throughout the film! Couldn't they find a hat to look after him? Even a small one? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight at the back. 4. He blows the smoke off his gun too many times if you know what I mean and I think you do. <br /> <br /> If you are an informal Bogart or Cagney fan and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a Western, do yourself a favor and forget that mindset. EVEN HORSES LOOK EMBARRASSED! (That is, when they are not bored.) <br /> With all fairness, I admit that westerns are my least favorite movie genre, but I still have seen much, much better than this. br /> <br /> At a comedy level or as a high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise it is the viewer beware. Therefore, only see this if a) you must see all western out there b) you are a true Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments appeal to you. Woah ?? ..
