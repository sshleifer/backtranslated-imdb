I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an everlasting fan of horror, from cheesy 80s American slashers to European zombie movies, I told myself it was amazing! I can't tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be pretty much a gorier than it really is. After all I heard about this movie, I was almost scared to see it. The murders are boring. The play ... forget it, there's no acting! The story, even though we don't care, is incredibly bad. It seems like they were trying to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately this doesn't help in this case. Why? There is no atmosphere and that is the worst thing about this flick. It's just bad movie making from points A to B. Although it's extremely fun and fun to watch with your friends and many beers, don't do anything to get it. There are so many movies in this world, don't play your time watching Necro Files!
