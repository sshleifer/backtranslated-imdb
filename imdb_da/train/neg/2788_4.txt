Much has been written about Purple Rain, the apparently "quin-essential" musical biofilm, but I'm here to tell you that the film doesn't deserve the high praise. First and foremost, let's get one thing right prince is a great musical and music is the one area where purple rain excels. Even the score is fascinating, and if this was shot exclusively as a concert movie, it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not and as such the film has some problems. First of all, the horrible actor / writing, the prince's character "The Kid" must come out as some kind of mysterious wages with few words unfortunately it just comes out like corny and incense. A good lonely character should at least have some flashy moments, unfortunately, the prince's character rarely has a few words of dialogue in the movie, and it's hard to believe he would get the girl this way. Everything just looks a little here, which is a shame because you can tell this is a sign that is terrible conflict and lives a very complicated live, but we are never allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this movie is how much this takes place in a concert. The life of Prince and Morris seems to take a place for the performances here, which I think makes sense from a business perspective, but it is exhausting to have a 2-hour film, apparently half of it happening on stage, especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it. <br /> <br /> So to sum it up: This is not a very good movie.
