What a horrible movie. It sucked. It was awful. I don't know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from some reviewers with a nail up in his ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. It's not Roger Corman I hate, it's this god-horrible movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. Which is another thing CGI sucked high; I hate this movie terribly. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the gayest B-Movie too. That's it --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry I must have offended some geeks in these moments. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
