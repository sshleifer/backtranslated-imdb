Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even explain what a Geisha is about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a little closer to the broad western audience and help subdue the country where Zen, Samurai, the Geisha world from Kyoto originated. Some of the movie's most interesting moments are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings. The geisha dancers were not authentic. There was too much use of Chinese music. A minor but important detail: Proper use of incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
