Description: Corny, totally stupid and worthless. It is so cheap and easy it will make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people even wasted 2 months or so of spending a budget (I guess this ...) probably not more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was just hysterical to see with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save your time, life and money, DON'T know - I repeat, don't even think about watching this movie. This film is so corny, it will make your face turn purple with horrified boredom. If you have a single-digit IQ, please be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You can actually admire it. (As I said before, if you have a one-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With approx. 12 players, a few dolls you bought in a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee you want to make a little more entertaining home video than this absolute crap.
