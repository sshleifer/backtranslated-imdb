This television movie tells the story of outgoing Frannie, who suddenly returns to Silk Hope, to visit friends and family, but ignorant of her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but intends to sell it and move away with her new husband. Frannie strongly protests against the idea and promises to keep the family heirloom as it was getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> You will find beautiful Ruben and the two will soon fall in love (as you do) and it is from this time that I have lost interest .... <br /> <br /> There is more to Farrah Fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character extremely convincing when she sits down to it - and this is certainly proven here as well as some of her past efforts as extremities and sacrifices - a great achievement from the legendary Charlie's Angel. Silk Hope is the kind of movie that never shines away from its cheap and cheerful TV picture, and you know there was a budget limit, but it's not the worst movie ever made. The positive aspects are there; You just have to find them.
