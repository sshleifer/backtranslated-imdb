Now I recently had the victory to watch the hilarious comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughing until it just hurt movie types. So I would obviously see the sequel, hoping it would have the same laugh, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made of American Pie generation where it is tasteful and defeats the hollow purpose of the first movie. Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it does not appear in each scene. Also, the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but it could have been a little more original. The only thing is that I'm happy that at least there are no old actors from the original in this movie because it would have been cheesy or really silly. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but they are very happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother Todd is afraid Ron will take his job. So they go on a weekend to Miami for a bachelor party, and Todd has to make sure he catches Ron in a picture that makes Melinda change her mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The last temptation has a few laughs here and there, but over all fail to deliver what the first movie did. These guys, Ron's friends, were more uncomfortable than sympathetic, except Seth, he was a little funny. The only similar signs to Seth are Ron and Melinda, everyone else just gets more or less on your nerves. Want to watch this movie? Just watch the Girls Gone Wild, it's just the same, it's not trying to pretend it's a movie. Stick to the original Bachelor Party, this is the movie that will get you into the tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
