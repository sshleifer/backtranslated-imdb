I didn't like this movie at all! First of all I do not know why, but everyone here says that Clémence Poésy's game is excellent, which in my opinion is completely wrong! She's not like Natasha: another look, another character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress and therefore she couldn't play that role! She completely disinfected the heroine! It was really disgusting to see her game! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role a Russian actress because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a full man who has not shaved 2 weeks and defeated a fight where he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this movie there are some actors whose games were amazing! I assume that Alessio Boni did his job very well! I was pleasantly surprised! He is one of the few people who have read the book, which is very important to the game. Also, I liked to play our Russian actors, it was really wonderful to see them)) The only thing I liked about this work was the very beautiful views and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand a real feeling, the goal for which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 from 10
