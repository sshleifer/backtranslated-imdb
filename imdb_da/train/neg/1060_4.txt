OK, so it was written in 1996 before September 11, so you can give it a little credit to worry about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this convicted flight out of the sky before it Bringing judgment to the world is prescient. That is it. These are the good things. Actor ... fair. The reason ... silly. "Twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It is not as if no one ever thought about what to do when a plane is polluted. Don't you think that bureaucrats have a "plague" manual and how to contain them? Proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It's not sending them out to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the doorway open and the "shooters" standing there without protection? In fact, was it ever shooting her legs? It would stop her. But not so dramatic I'm a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end when I started it. But this was a waste of time and mostly predictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to see all the ads, it was a plus. It is a good example of why I see so little network TV. Never mind.
