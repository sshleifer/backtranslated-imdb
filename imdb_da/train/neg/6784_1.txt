I tried to watch this movie twice and even so quickly forward the annoying parts, but still couldn't make it to the end. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how this movie * really * has got good reviews. I think these people give such good reviews just trying to raise the film for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic, and it looks like an inside job, making things more pitiful. Movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not constructed !! <br /> <br /> The play is reminiscent of a cheesy porn movie and not in a fun way. I don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I found the protagonist to be annoying. His facial expressions and humor were barely childish. I thought it was appropriate to make women's conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very awkward (his managers overdone business speech) and unfunny sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything redeeming about this movie than some of the attractive women. Never have I felt that a judgment was this misleading. I was interested in its premise but scared of everything else. Of course, see it if you want, but I just didn't want anyone to get their hopes up or waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
