Cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap I've ever wasted my time watching. This show based on Geico advertising is less entertaining than a 30 sec ad for Geico. The makeup was half-robbed to say the least, hard to imagine a hollow man with prefective white teeth, even after going to the dentist. This show could have had the potential for a fun series if they could get the draft from the advertisements that in themselves make it a miserable show. Perhaps if the authors were the same from the Geico ads, this might have a chance, but instead the pilot lacked a good story. I give this show a 1 out of 10, I would have liked to put a zero out of 10, but it wasn't an option. I ask for a quick death for this show, I will give it less than 5 episodes before it dies a deserved death.
