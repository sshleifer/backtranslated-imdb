Deathstalker is directed by John Watson, and it is Rick Hill who is a kind of bodybuilder and famous about it if I have understood correctly? The reason follows when Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something back from the evil lord, and he must travel to the cave of the Lord. He meets many dwarves and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of the great success of Conan, and although this is very silly movie, it has many good trash cans and is recommended for garbage cans and tolerates movie junkies! <br /> <br /> There are no many movie merits in this movie. Pair scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates on showing is the nude and huge muscles of Hill. Women are usually helpless victims and very stupid too, so it is very macho film and therefore cannot be so many feminists! The battle scenes are nothing special and pretty boring, and the monsters are nothing special either. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very amateurish and poorly done, but what do you expect from low budget efforts like this? This tries to be as good as Conan, but fails quite a bit. As I said, it may well be Turkish cinema fans, but no one else. This belongs to the category, it's so bad it's amazing! Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be, and as a turkey movie I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, of course fun! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try it and have fun, but if you don't understand "pleasantly bad movies," stay away. And if someone can't hold a large amount of nudity, then get away too. There is more nudity here than violence, and because of these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise, this can be a safe PG family movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
