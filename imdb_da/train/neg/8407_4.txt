From the stupid "picturesque African native" travel book material with our poorly-directed instructors acting as narrators, to the horrible false ears that transform imprisoned Indian elephants into African elephants into the complete lack of any logic whatsoever to Maureen O'Sullivan's incessant whining of "Tarzan! Tarzan!" There is nothing about this movie that deserves classical status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
