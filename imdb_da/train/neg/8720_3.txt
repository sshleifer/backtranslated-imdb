Set aside a Dr. House Repeat that I had missed and a Desperate Housewives (new) to see this. I don't know exactly what plagued this movie. I never thought I'd say this, but I want my 15 minute fame back. <br /> <br /> Script, Direction, I can't say. I recognized the stake actors (the usual suspects), but thought that Herbert Marshall was a class extension and sat down for a good cheesy flick. Boy, was I wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where the "office girl" does with the 029 keyboard and puts the cards in a 087 variety. LOL @ "computer". I want someone to identify the next device - a 477? It is before even this dinosaur's time. <br /> <br /> And we dinosaurs don't have much time to waste.
