Rounding off the 1929-30 all-talkie "Our Gang" release plan, "A Tough Winter" has two stories. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, at home alone on a winter day, decide to do something taffy. Little Wheezer relays the instructions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from various shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Quiet moments arise when the rest of the time turns out to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house! The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / handyman in time, and his interactions with gang. <br /> <br /> "A hard winter" has never been shown on television, even though it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization, which shows a sharp, blurred and slow moving character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "talented cartoon" and used this "Our Gang" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is abusive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shrouded. Although there are some fun moments both with Fetchit and taffy, "A Tough Winter" is a plodding and meandering effort. If a positive came out of this movie, it was that Hal Roach Studios grew convinced and experienced making talks. The sound in the movie is good and some of the sound effects used are very fun. For this reason, this film partially paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 "Our Gang" films. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
