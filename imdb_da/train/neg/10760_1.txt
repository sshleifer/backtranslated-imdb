This "movie" is the culmination of all that is bad about modern movies. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary flipping / jumping / buzzing, unnecessary signs, unnecessary dialogue .... basically unnecessary. (Is that a word? Well, it has just been invented by me, Robot.) What happened to practicality? (ie car garage, skin spray) The only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the short stroke in the coffee shop. What happened to women? (ie Smith's character does nothing but break down the doctor for the best part of the movie, and yet she will still "have" him. Where is the excitement? I will tell you how good it looks and not admiration or common ground) < br /> <br /> What happened to a detective who registered? Smith did nothing but sit and regret himself, complain to other people, and when they said something that constituted a thought, he was off. It's such a bad way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (Speak several times in a row, what was "Snoring and not listening to you joke? Twice in a scene?) What happened to the little parts of a movie that was something meaningful? And not just a tool to save scenes Shia LaBeouf (the child) is in the movie for a total of two scenes, we know A-he breaks down women, and B-he at Smith ....... then off course we should care about him and whether he is hurting <br /> <br /> What happened to Hero? Let's just forget that there are people, women, and children everywhere who are attacked by robots and selfish saves the only person in my opinion that I'm familiar with. And why should he ramp up his bike through the air and show himself while the doctor could somehow reach the same distance in seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong I am all too acting, but I'm also too skewed of realism and meaning, I have to say that I never laughed so hard on a movie in a long time, so thank you, A lex. <br /> <br /> I ask for the social pendulum turn back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler everything else in movies ...... but mostly simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Movies: "So You Must Die"
