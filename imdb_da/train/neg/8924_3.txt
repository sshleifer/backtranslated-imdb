It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven script. <br /> <br /> While some of it is witty and hip, it's part of it boring, involuntary, and lifeless. Many of the gags just sit there, missing spark and energy. From the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch come over well. Roger Lord in the role of Rusty shines (too badly he did not make any more films). But for my money, just too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed hardly gets a fight. His character seems to skim around the sidelines and wonder what he is doing in this movie. The low user rating should give an idea of ​​public opinion on this piece. Vidal's original delivered a lot of potential that was largely wasted. Not even the "classic" movie clips did much. All in all, a pretty subparent effort, and it's not likely to get much better over time.
