I recently saw this at Palm Springs International Film 2009. This is the functional length direct debut of veteran Dutch actor Monique van de Ven and on the basis of my observation it must be her last. I hate movies that are so incredible that you choose each other almost every scene. This film will immediately leave you scratching your head. When it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend working for an international relief organization, having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-ruled mountains Afghanistan has a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They come out of their vehicle to see when talliban warriors equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, small arms and grenades carry all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is discovered by one of the rebels who lobs a grenade on those who kill his girlfriend. as they are with a throw distance, they cannot be more than 50 meters away, but he somehow comes away. His girlfriend is blown up, and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as this year's photographer for the photo. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as it opens. The following year, Bob finds himself tasked with National Geographic on a Dutch resort where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into his cunning underworld of international drug abusers. Avoid this movie. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
