Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There is often quite lame, moral dedication and just plain. Then this is the show! It has a dull cast, though A.Bynes is okay in its nice way, the rest is just stereotype crap .... as always. We've all seen it before and will probably see it all again when this show is canceled. Reason, let's look at it, it's a mediocre and self-righteous show. As most sitcoms are .... <br /> <br /> Now, in short. If you want to see good entertainment, you might rather take a twenty minute break in front of the mirror. Make some faces and continue .... It's more entertaining than this show!
