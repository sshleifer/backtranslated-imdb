From the beginning of the movie I had the feeling of being a movie about another Jason from Friday the 13th. And that's ... Dispute that the movie is starting to be interesting. But as time goes by its just a meaningless movie about subdued, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean, he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound that is not seen by anyone. He should be blind after failed execution, but he goes and kills people as he used to. I'm tired of it. For me, it's over the same. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. Well scene with tidal woman so impressive, but only in the first place:} To it and for exciting intro 2 stars.
