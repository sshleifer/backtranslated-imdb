Something that doesn't really go down with Al Gore (and his followers) theory is all about "consensus". <br /> <br /> If there was such a consensus, why is the "believer" in the omnipotent global warming feeling the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who asks them. Why is it that anyone who does not tolerate the global warming line meets with accusations of being either stupid or on the oil companies' payroll (apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you are on any payroll in the wonderful world ...) Why is there a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled when it is nature's nature to ask questions about assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to these questions, read Prey of the well-known oil-rich Michael Crichton. Oh wait, he's rich and not on the oil companies' payroll. He just took a great career risk by not tolerating the green and other Kyoto worshipers and telling the truth when he examined it. That way, did you know that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures, according to its own backers? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to stay away from, so he didn't get every penny of the environmental lobby if he decided to run again. So who's a stooge ..?
