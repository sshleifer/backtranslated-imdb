So there is an old security guard and a guy who dies, and then there is KEVIN, the world's largest wuss. Kevin will impress her incredibly insensitive, bratty and virgin boyfriend AMY. As he returns from work to ... a random house ... he finds his "friends", the sexually confusing, red-carded chile, and the truly disgusting ending DAPHNE. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the trigger-happy sex-crazed macho lunatic NICK. And there are titles of beings, horrible little dog puppets that kill humans by giving them their heart's desire. Kyle's heart wants to be prepared with a spooky, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's heart wants to throw grenades into a class school cafeteria - I mean nightclub. The wish of Kevin's heart is to beat a skinny gang with nunchucks. Amy's heart wants to be a disgusting slam. Daphne is already a disgusting sludge so she does not have a heart desire. Along the way, a truly destructive band sings a really strange song. Hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up. The "Citizen Kane" cannot keep a light on this true American cinema masterpiece.
