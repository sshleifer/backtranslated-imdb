There have been very few movies I have not been able to sit through. I made it through Battle Field Earth no problem. But this, this is one of the worst movies ever to be made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg has been trying to trade in it. I don't blame her. I was ashamed to get this on a CV. I think it's a rare occasion when almost every gag in a movie falls flat on that face. Now it happens here. Not to mention SFX, look for dino with the control cables hanging out of the rear end !!!!!! Halfway through the movie I was still looking for a plot. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of renting this and saving 90 minutes of your life.
