This is definitely the stupidest movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a fantastic cast. It is James Cromwell who ignoramus plays the substitute. I could go on, but of course I would spend more time on this review than anyone ever did on the script. The only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapsticks beyond any reasonable human's tolerance. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
