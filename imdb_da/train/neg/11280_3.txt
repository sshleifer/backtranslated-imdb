This film is about a man's life going wrong. His business fails and he cannot impregnate his wife despite several attempts. The reason is complete chaos. It just doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie means meaning. The story is so badly told that I simply couldn't understand it. It's a shame because the sets and costumes are finished well and are visually stimulating enough. The shoots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redemption functions still cannot compensate for the bad plot and bad storytelling. I'm amazed at the big names that agreed to steal in this movie. It is such a waste of their talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid it !!
