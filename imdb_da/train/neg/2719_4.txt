When a small world wave age stupid kittens land on the earth, it soon begins to take the course and emphasize. The only part of this pointless drive I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes it could slice and be sold to Swiss cheese. This thing actually made $ 20 million? And McQueen's salary was 3K? Everyone was very overpaid. The "monster" looked much like a big bean bag and "teenagers" looked as if they could have children approaching their teens. And they blast from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. The ending was pitiful pace; Of course, the producers left the door open for a successor .... and there were many. Thumbs down.
