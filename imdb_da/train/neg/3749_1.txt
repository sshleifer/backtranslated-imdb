Wow, I love and respect pretty much everything David Lynch has done. However, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt to make a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> To give you a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual film maker, but this had little visual artistic content (empty walls, "upset" with ceiling in the background) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch typically has great pride in sound, but in this you can even hear the camcorder's hum. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the thought, that he had something to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> This is a joke on David's side to force the fans to search their site (in hours) to find this drive. I hope so, for at least the idea is fun.
