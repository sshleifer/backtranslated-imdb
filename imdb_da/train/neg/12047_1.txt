I had the greatest enthusiasm to go into advance screening for this movie. After all, it is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say it was a big disappointment. They completely plotted a joke and turned the case into a long soap opera. The elements that were faithful to the plot were sprinkled on such a random way that the audience laughed many times at the stupid script that just paid lip service to this battle in all games. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of almost matrix-like powers, complete recklessness and male lovers in the original poem) turning to "Fabio on the beach" in the fate of Pitt (as with a good script and more effort could have made it the most complex and original war figure ever produced by Hollywood. Actors were actually decent and tried to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a light to them. Lots of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough combat scenes for a movie that is about a long fight and siege. I would not recommend that anyone pay to see this story drawn through dirt as one of the signs was (at least they got the right part).
