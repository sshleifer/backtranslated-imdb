Simply put, this is a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this will not try to be anything deep or do much with Hitler's character. Rather, from the first minutes of the movie, where we see that baby Hitler looks evil with evil music playing the background, we get a picture of Hitler presenting his as a cartoon-like supervillian, apparently torn straight out of a TV show on Saturday morning. The movie really wants to make its case that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? In the end, he makes such a one-dimensional evil character both boring and confusing (one has to ask how the innocent, psychotic character of the film cold ever convinces a nation to follow him or be called Time's man of the year). This film had a great opportunity to take a character who has committed some of the most horrible acts of the 20th century and try to dive into his mind. Instead, it says pretty much just, "Hi! Hitler was bad! Just thought you might want to know ..." over and over again. The big irony is that the film was still attacked to present sympathetic a picture of the character. Give me a break.
