I saw this movie for a number of reasons, the most important being Mira Sorvino. With her on the roll it couldn't be that bad. And it even seemed to have some mystery, and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at that time and he was pretty good at "incredible". The story is set in Spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you think of the same, let me warn you: this is a really horrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. The story is constructed with subplots that do not add the story. They are trying to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but not terribly. The turnarounds have no credibility, and the so-called study leads nowhere. The people are paper thin! I didn't care about anyone. More than that they are annoying and rather hateful people. The play is terrible. Mira what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! Keep some dignity! Her character was weak, but it is no excuse for such a terrible achievement. She seems to be wandering the whole movie long. Come to think of it, I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I used to think this woman was sexy. Now she's not here. If you want to look at any skin, try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And that accent? My god ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is just the worst. It is too painful to remember his achievements to describe this. Sorry, but I can't. Ive had enough with this waste. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way, it's a strange how it was done though. A miserable team to produce a miserable script and make some money over the actor's name. Don't fall for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
