In 1941, Columbia was a fully-fledged studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM, Paramount or Warners. It is the best that could be said of "Adam Had Four Sons", a leaden soap opera with almost definitive dazzling performances by Ingrid Bergman (top image for the first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchman (this was the era in which Hollywood believed that a foreign accent was as good as another), who was hired as Governor of Baxter's four sons and stayed (with an interruption caused by the stock market in 1907) until the boys are adult men who serve in the First World War. Just about everyone in the movie is so good-good, it's a relief when Susan Hayward as the villain joins midway through ?? she's about the only attentive person in the movie, even though she clearly channels Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; It is also the first in her long legacy of alcoholic roles ?? but the manuscript remains saccharin, and the end is completely preposterous. It is no wonder that Bergman knocked down the correspondingly planned "Valley of Decision" four years later.
