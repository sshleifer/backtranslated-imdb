not your typical vamp story, not the bram stoker or any other rice here. a truly original vampire story. These vampires are genetic mutants that sunlight does not bother. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. many of the actors are clearly amateurs. the two drivers who play van helsing and rally vampire chick are pretty good though. The film is extremely violent, which can disturb some people. Also it is filled with scientific details that many will find difficult to understand and can be bored with. I was sold on the clever story and the couple good performances. no one to tell how lucky this movie could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution
