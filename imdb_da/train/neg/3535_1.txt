Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you tripping your head on Ecstasy tubes? There were so many of you. Did you do it for a trip? Is that some kind of cool? Or did Guy Richie even sign up 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I will say this. Just because you don't understand a movie doesn't mean it's not amazing. Maybe you had a bad day at work or you sat down to watch a movie after you had a row with your wife and then not in the mood. Perhaps there is a more fundamental obstacle - as if you just don't have the mental capacity or a highly developed philosophical sense to engage in it. BUT. And this is a very, very big one. XXL elephant-size mega-but to finish all buts. <br /> <br /> DO NOT HAVE confusing incoherence for complexity, and please confuse this two-hour non-squirrel with an interesting movie. Really. You might think you're pretty smart. You can even think of yourself as something of a romantic figure: An independent thinker who masters a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. You do not. You are embarrassing for yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of time. If you thought about it, in a few minutes, you will recognize it too. It was a waste of the throw, a waste of the crew, a waste of the catering companies and certainly a waste of the precious minutes (you can't get them back, you know) of any unfortunate to sit through this unbearable, miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait," comes a voice in the dark. "You just don't understand, it's non-linear. That means the story doesn't go into a REAL LINE. This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTHOR. it first came out - didn't you hear? - Because they couldn't cope with the complexity, the humble pies now eat. Bet you hate Lynch movies too, Doncha? "<br /> <br /> Hate to disappoint you but I'm a pretty big Lynch fan. I like Memento, so a story told in an unconventional way does not necessarily fill me with fear. And although I've only studied it briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me a lot. I do not like Revolver for these reasons. I do not like it because it allegedly deals with heavy, large brained subjects, but deals with them in such an insulting superficial way of being ridiculous. I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works, seems to be a president four years old. I don't like it, because the characters, without exception, completely alienated me. "Aha!" cries Richie apologize. "Guy cuts his hat to Brecht smoothly!" Just maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can't write a proper script for caramel. <br /> <br /> Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is actually really educational. Fight Club has acid-tongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has obsolete fortune cookie rejecting one-liners that make your ears soft. Fight Club has a good twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened. Revolver, as far as I can tell, has several incomprehensible terms that do not give any satisfaction because ... it does not make sense. If you continue to pull the blanket out of people, they will kick you out of their house. And then they lock all doors and windows. And they never let you back. Ever. Guy Richie seems to assume to be philosophically involving repeating a mantra of small buzz phrases. For the most part, they are spoken, but often they flash on the screen with attributes. It's almost pathological. But what makes this movie particularly remarkable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can get married so nicely with all the tired gangster clichés in the world. In the end it is so insignificant. You don't care about anything. You don't understand anything. You go home. <br /> <br /> In fact, there was a bit, I really liked: the tense assassin who has a crisis of confidence. He's amazing. But I can't recommend watching the movie just to see him. He's only in it for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe in me. It's terrible.
