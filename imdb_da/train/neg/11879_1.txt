My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as a "recommended" choice if you liked "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous and with characters reminding me of people I have worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" because they are both movies. This is where the similarity ends. We probably sat through the first 50 minutes of the HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, no, * asking * that it would get better. It didn't. We couldn't take it anymore and stopped the tape. Thank God, it was a free rental. I would have been okay if we had actually paid for it. We must be proven to have to sit through it. Now, as we did not see the end, it may miraculously come together and release itself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is so bad, it's hard to believe it was ever produced. The movie is so unfunny it is painful. Just send the friggin letters already !!! The prerequisite is asinin. The jokes are terrible. We got the "printer not working" scene and had to stop. We couldn't take it anymore. This movie is a decoration for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Office Space ...... don't waste your time with this ride. 0/10
