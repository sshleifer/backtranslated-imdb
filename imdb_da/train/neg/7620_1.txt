I rented this movie because it sounded quite interesting, but for my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he must be part of the cast or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or any denied cult member, no one in their right mind would believe that this film had any potential. I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. <br /> <br /> Quote: "From the" Dune "inspired opening animation to the fast pace ... this movie keeps the eye moving and works so well that repetition of viewing is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> The animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting, and the fact that the film keeps the eye moving, is because you are watching any kind of excitement. I think giving me a break Halloween was shot with a $ 100,000.00 budget and a painted mask and also became a cult classic. As far as "repeat viewing is not unexpected," I think he made a style. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: "The act is also a strong aspect of the movie." <Br /> <br /> With all due respect to the actors, their performance is no more than Robert Napton's respective talent. The captivating tagline: "Beware of the hour between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> This is because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPAA rating "Nominated R for some violence / gore" <br /> <br /> The only thing you see is some red paint on a sheet of a dead body you never see. As far as I know, it can be a lump of grass. In summary, I have seen horror flicks from the 50s, 60s and 70s. I have seen what I thought to be the worst and some that were very good. The director of this movie also did not attempt, slept, or took a blow. No matter what I mean, the actors deserve applause for trying to save a very bad job creating. I would give this movie a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie.
