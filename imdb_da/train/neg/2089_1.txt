Of course I saw BG. I loved S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was ok, and loved the final. Yay, there's a spin-off show! I didn't even know about this, one of my friends told me about this. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of dirt! Teenage girl drama partying. There is no science fiction ... yes, almost none. At the end of each episode, we can catch a glimpse of a Cylon. That's all. Who cares about this? Have they decided that the next show's target audience will be women under the age of 18? Boring religious nonsense speeches, groans, bitches ... and more. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that there's nothing out there for the moment to see. Stargate destroyed, BG over ...
