"The 'Malcom' show on FOX really makes a killing ... can't we make our own version?" Of course, I wonder and rewrite of course, but in our hearts we all know that this is true, and that the only thing NBC added to the 'Malcom' metric was sex. And boy, they added six ... <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers it with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters her aunt into the shower and she accuses him of seeing her and turning off. He spies on the sweet girl in the next house from her bedroom window, and she knows he will see her topless, but she bothers him by smiling and closing the window. And that's all in the pilot. Take it from an adult man - a boy's puberty is so sex-run and testicular, it is impossible to make fun of an ordinary audience. The only times that have ever come close have been in movies, and you can count them on one side. So, it is not surprising that "Tucker" has the warmth and appeal of a strip-club bathroom. Did the network actually find us wanting to see the children intervene in puberty? Isn't that the thing people are in prison for? If you doubt the show's depravity consider this: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes broadcast; they then made the unprecedented movement of "burning" the remaining episodes by moving them at midnight so no children could see them. Chronic since the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to its general ambiguity, Tucker has an ongoing voice-over from the protagonist to educate the foamed writing. Even in 2000, it was terribly dated, with random music and super-sarcasm. I didn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes, and the jokes didn't come as little as a minute ... Shame on NBC for this dirty rip-off ... they're better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
