This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was kind of a remake, but then again, not really. I was very disappointed with the tools available to Tim Burton. He had great make-up and CGI available and lots of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got was just as good as the original movie made under $ 6 million? Heck no. So in that respect the film fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original movie, the statue of liberty scene was shocking, but there was nothing shocking in this movie even the scene because you could see it coming well. And by the way, if you think about it, and I did, you can find out how the ending could come. I just wish I had left the time I wasted, thought about it. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been brilliant and fun if it was in line with the first movie and adopted part of "Under Planet of the Apes". Here's how I would have written it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut (it should really have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care for a movie all alone so I would have put in three guys) would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter people (not mutate), a city run by monkeys, chased, made friends with some good monkeys, discover that they are on the ground finding some ruined ruins, end up running into crazy mutant people living underground, breaking a war between the mutant people and the monkeys and then .... well, let your imagination run wild about how you want to finish it. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there could have been so much more to this movie. Unfortunately, by Tim Burton really how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten instructor, who thinks of people. He is trendy, so he must be good going thought. Sorry but no. If anyone else made this movie, it would have been much better and would have been far more satisfying.
