If you like movies about creepy cities, hotels, houses, states (eg Eagles "Hotel California"), etc. There are people who "just go through" you read almost any Stephen King novel instead . If you like the "disappearance" option, you begin to read Kings' Desperation, but also check "The Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Needful Things." <br /> <br /> The crow motif, the desert, the family running in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired. Why didn't they just make the movie from the "Desperation" novel? Maybe they approached King and he nixed? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin are delighted to be reunited and they have both been well-behaved over the years, but they are still television and direct to DVD-caliber actors.
