Horrible play, bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in, I decided to fast forward to see if there was something redeeming ... It did not. (Except for a good chest shot) The film was apparently included in some furniture stores, and the same stock was used for at least 90% of the sets. You even see the same red chair in several places. If you want to make a movie, you rent at least one office building and one apartment, no store that will echo all your actor's dialogue. (Note to manufacturers) Renting a small office space and a one-month apartment is much cheaper than a fully stocked one, and both are quite more versatile and credible.) If you spend your money to rent this people, I hope you have it with a return guarantee ... You will need your money back ... I only spent $ 2.99 to rent this tonight and I feel ripped off.
