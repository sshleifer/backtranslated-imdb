The problem with the book, "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces, but beneath the surfaces, it was all an American man's way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with good music, sets and costumes, yet made by barnyard animals dressed in these costumes. So far from Japanese ways of thinking were the signs. The movie isn It is not Japan or true geisha. It is a story of a few American men's wrong ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misunderstandings. So what is this movie if it's not about Japan or Geisha? Is it pure imagination that so many people have said? Yes, but then why make it an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missing options. Imagine a culture where there are no puritan hang-ups, no connotations about sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie, Sayuri wrinkles his nose and grimaces with disgust for five seconds as if the man is trying to mount her, had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her steps. <br /> Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nix. A sign is said to be promiscuous, but all we see is her pushing her lover because it seems she won't be caught doing something dirty. Such a typical American puritanism has no place in a film about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy her first rapture of some old codges after her cherry was auctioned? Nix. She lies there like a cold plate of meat on a chopping block. Of course she should not enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they have given anything to her? Why should all sex be sinful and wrong? Behind Mameha, the president was Sayuri's secret protector, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won herself. Nobu did not even offer bids. So why did the president let the old codger win her, and stabbing the old man stink, slipping her fingers over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for it? Let's try to make sense of this. Being behind Mameha, the president has held debt to Sayuri's geisha training. To repurchase his debt, the rapporteur, Sayuri, had sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha, the president sold Sayuri's sexual favors to the old frogs so that the president could make some money out of her. The chairman was not her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story. Yes, the movie is beautiful, but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, prolonged transvestite whose voice, appearance and touch are exciting. But beneath the very feminine surface lies a creepy secret. Under the wrong Japanese surface of the film, the vicious secret lurks that the heart, soul, spirit, and core of this movie are American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie, distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: Japanese style ?? Refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG quiet ?? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Hair swept up. MOON geisha ?? Loose hair that must definitely have got it all in the thick paste of white makeup. Japanese Shaved Ice - Japanese is pretty strict about seasonal observations. Shaved ice is strictly a summer holiday. MOAG shaved ice - The president buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri is played by the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this treats during the cherry blossoming season. The thought made my whole body shake with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Trainer and skilled entertainers. MOOD geisha - concludes. Japanese Wind Clock - Used in the summer because they hear the sound it does, thanks to the breeze, Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime - a doorbell! If a person stood in front of someone else's house and made sounds with a wind chime, they would be considered a lunatic, not gaining entry. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Focus on human relations, group oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is my" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? Refined elegance. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG dance ?? Martha Graham freaking out at LSD while wearing a non-very promising white Japanese funeral dress. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place similar to a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha? <br /> <br /> Japan house four ?? Setting or even breaking a fire is worse than killing because it poses such a serious threat to society. Fires can tear through the wooden towns, cities and cities that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill so many people. MOAG house fire - Good complement to a battle scene, but there are zero ramifications, and because it is no longer needed, the out-of-control fire miraculously unfolds. Technically, the film ended here because Sayuri would at least have been excluded and joined his sister among those who never heard again. This is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall would be exiled. <br /> <br /> Enough. The movie stinks.
