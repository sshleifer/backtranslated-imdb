I will never forget the white and big comedy of ORIGINAL Vacation movie! The lines, pacing and timing of events in that movie are excellent! But this European holiday successor is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Griswalds wins a European holiday at a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the movie are a little more than mild, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, a Flight Attendant on a plane asks Clark, "Do you want your cola in the can?" Clark answers back, "No, I'm right here." It's really about the only line that's fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> The European holiday humor is strained. As if the authors borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, they tried to re-hash a script that had been done before and stood on a ridiculously slap-stick chase scene sequence towards the end of the picture just to kill time. /> <br /> Worse, the natural comics like Randy Quaid like cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie as well, are nowhere to be found. Their replacements are not fun, can't act, and just look like they're going through the movements most of the time. There are also a few raw sex jokes and comments that are not only fun, they are in bad taste. Griswald should have stayed at Wally World. The place made them legends! Don't join this European terrible adventure. Viewers should watch the original Vacation movie again instead of this! You will be glad you did.
