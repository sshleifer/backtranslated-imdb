When I looked at this, I saw first and foremost the ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It is a product placement after another. It is quite obvious how this film got its funding. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. Any Dick should never get a job because he plays the same lame character. "History" is only a basis for this very long commercial. I can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical releases. The longer you see the movie, the more you are embarrassed by everyone involved. The only less saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who hardly get any screen shots like Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed that I saw it all. I would recommend avoiding this one.
