This movie was almost unacceptable to sit through. I can overcome the fact that it seems that it was shot with a home camera and that this movie should span weeks in time, but the characters don't even change clothes, but the play broke the fourth wall to me. I've seen better appear in a 4th grade game. Apart from that, the plot is unrealistic. If the man lost the guy, he would have hit him. I was also very disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun, what kind of gore is that. It's not a copycat, the Zodiac didn't kill with a gun, the authorities would have known it wasn't him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when it is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. All in all, I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be made with a low budget at least not as low as they had, or they could have made sure they had better actors or more. Lots of people have gone the low budget route without having to use horrible actors watch the Easy Rider, which had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
