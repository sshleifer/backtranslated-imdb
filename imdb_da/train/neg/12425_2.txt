I don't know what you breathe, but please stop. This movie was complete waste. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was loving, sweet, sweet, loving and extremely fun to see. He had it innocent, but at the same time he was strong. <br /> <br /> This new kid, Alex? Annoying as hell! Just a blatant ripoff by trying to match Culkin's charm and grace, elusive in it. <br /> <br /> Villains, complete crap. Harry and Marv, they were such an entertaining screen team. They were comical, they were humorous, and just made you really want to root to Culkin even more, which is what a good villain supposes to do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who just bicker and again, trying to exploit the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not to say that they were terrible, but they were not memorable or even really enjoyable. More on the corny side actually. <br /> <br /> We got the actual movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Memorable. Perfect to look around at Christmas and bring a lovely Christmas meeting and bring out so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story and worry about the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Masterpiece of crap. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Everything and I don't know why people like this. I think people really don't know what a good movie is. It is a crazy sequel with several unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character child, whom I wish the robbers would at least knock off the shed. <br /> <br /> Run, run away from this garbage. And let's not even start with part 4!
