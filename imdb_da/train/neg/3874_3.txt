This movie was so predictable that you always hope that the obvious suspect is innocent and there is another great twist that still comes. But it doesn't. He just continues to act scary and she continues to ignore it. Mary found very incriminating evidence in his place and she still trusted him? And what was it that "baiting the trap"? There were no traps. She confronted him, he said, "excuse me. I'll kill someone" He left, and that was the end of it. They try to use other suspects (like the older carnival at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the setting is simply strange ... who's hanging in a recycling plant ?? Its notch and nothing is well developed. For example: When she leaves her place after having beer and he finds the pictures and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in the car ... what was that? Her reactions were not portrayed. In the car she acted scared as if it could have been almost rape - but then we see everything that she showered the next morning. booooooooo It could have been so much better .. sooo much better.
