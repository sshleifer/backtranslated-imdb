I just want to know that I don't often rate movies during a 5th. I was initially very excited to watch this movie. Its several trailer skins on TV for months made me really want to watch this movie. So the second night when I saw it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. Storylinet seemed exciting enough - some guys beat unsuspecting people on the metro. There is a photographer who is obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some pictures he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher and follows him around, yada yada. The movie had a way to suck you in, although the plot was very predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you." I say, sorry about the cheap tensions. The plot, though predictable, was exciting ... it's until the end. "It was good until the end .... Then it just got silly," says Jack_skellington_freke on the bulletin boards. And I totally agree. And here comes the spoilers ... See, I hoped it was something crazy killer, some psychotic people obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept beings alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've had amazing movies, but this one is immersed.
