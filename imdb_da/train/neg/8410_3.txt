This movie is all flash and no soul. The actors are passionate about the numbers, but these songs often do not have a connection to the movie and felt like stand-alone music videos. And nothing was done to make the numbers sound like they were right in front of you, every sound as if coming from a studio that essentially sucks the whole life from the songs. From the scene, the performances were all boring and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same anger, "strong" (she's stubborn and selfish) black woman we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth for her character, nor any of the other female leads. Although I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's character is facing tribulations because of his weight, it is really her own refusal to do the best for the team that lands her in trouble, which makes the end of the movie meaningless. The Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. As she sang, she exclaimed emotions (though often wrong, but it was the author's / director's fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to eradicate an already signed character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with a bow and he did a fine job but still not worthy of Oscar. The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively insignificant character and did something right out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth into, no drama or heart, or even laugh. The location of the songs was so bad that the movies sometimes seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one; The number when Hudson argues with the other girls is so long-lasting, if it had been longer, it could pass for a Family Guy shit. The film has no idea what it's all about, and I felt offended by the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and really is the worst movie I saw in '06, and nothing last year was really great at first.
