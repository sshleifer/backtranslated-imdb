What? It's fun to see his confidence in being fun. The man has no identity whatsoever ... I think you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he is trying very hard to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly, and what comes out are some parts where he looks a little like Denzel, with the macho attitude and then abruptly going to be Martin Lawrence, the fun and clumsy-stupid cartoon. There is nothing personal about everything I think he does not contribute to the personality he is trying to sell, and I am sure he has nothing to say personally. He is really Mr. Dull-boy in person. I really hoped for Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better off in superstardom, like. Don Cheadle, but perhaps the pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old one.
