Probably a movie that predicts the upcoming trends in British popular music, it is wrong on so many fronts that it is ridiculous. Tommy fast? Honeycombs? The movie DOES includes a song from the Spencer Davis group, two of the animals, and a dressed up live movie from the Beatles, making their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But all in all, an awkward exhibition of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman's Hermits.
