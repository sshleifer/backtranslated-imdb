As a sewing agent, I have pain that I have to give a below average rating to an overtly Christian film. There are certainly not so many that I want to deter filmmakers from a genre that is severely underutilized. Still, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typical low budget, low key, self-confident Christian movie. The reason is predictable, the real mediocre (I am friendly) and editing abominable. As a television movie, it may have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Continue trying guys. You need to have a movie about real Christians inside you somewhere. Can I suggest turning to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
