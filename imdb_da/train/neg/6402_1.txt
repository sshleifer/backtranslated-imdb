When I watched this movie, around 1979, it became the first movie I ever went out in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses fun and it misses every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the sketches. While I enjoy healthy humor where appropriate, these sketches were excessively vulgar. What was even more annoying was that this film was announced as "Robin Williams First Movie", utilizing its new found fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy". But his role turned out to be so small that you can't even see him on the screen.
