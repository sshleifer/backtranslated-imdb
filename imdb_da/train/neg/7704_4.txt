Well, there's no real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and free sex (which can also be fun, but it's not in this case). What more can I say about this ...? The action is when it happens, inventive, and there is a cool scene where two characters fall from a skyscraper (one must be several miles high), but generally there is not much to recommend "Kite". See it if you want, but you don't miss much if you skip this ...
