I have to say that in my childhood I am very proud of many of the movies I have rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the all-time scam movie in every actor's resume. Can you just imagine what Whoopie's fired agent should have told her to sign on this piece of crap? Hey Whoop you've ever seen, show dinosaurs, well, they make a movie out of it and you'll see Germany! "Then, this agent must have referred to Star Wars very much. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought out every copy of this movie and had it destroyed. I just wished that she could have done the same for my memory because my sister still gives me shed to watch that movie. I mean, I will even admit that I saw Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons why I gave up on both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), but this sticks to my mind as the worst of my childhood, and the greatest extinction state in my life, and it was 16 years ago. will do the math. <br /> <br /> When I think of my all-time list of worst movies, I don't even mention this because, as a raped step-child, I'm trying hard to suppress it ever happened Screw on Whoopie, just be glad that people only acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff.
