I watched this movie at Sundance 2005 and was stunned by how bad it was, even though I was thrilled to see it on the basis of the catalog description. Probably a "mockumentary" of two high school students who made a documentary on high school life, there was bad behavior, poor instruction, complete lack of engaging characters as written, and everything around is a total bust. I love good movies about high school, and it's not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-conscious "cool", even though they are supposed to be sold out. You get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting by making a planned bad movie to show their friends, but somehow it came into Sundance. Mystifying.
