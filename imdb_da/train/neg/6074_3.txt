What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you are going to make a movie involving baseball and showing scenes of baseball, then the action at least makes something realistic. Why did the crowd always play without any special reason? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie .... what was it? We have somehow thought that DeNiro has found his way on the court in a judge's uniform and that the game itself is played in a violent downturn .... one of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10
