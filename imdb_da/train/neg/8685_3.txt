Actually, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little comic book series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) Bush jokes. Apparently, I should have lowered my expectations even more. The scripture was completely pathetic. Aside from the Cheney-Chicken-Eating joke, and some giggly-small swipes, it was really boring and unfunny. <br /> <br /> The animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen year old Flash Project. It is shameful that they used Macromedia's product for this because it is capable of much more. <br /> <br /> I don't like Bush so much, and I enjoy a Bush joke as much as the next guy, but this was just half an hour's swipe on the president with several painfully u-fun moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did so much more with That's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "That's My Bush". You want to thank me.
