Contains spoilers The movie plot can be summed up with few sentences: Three guys are hunting in the forest. Two of them along other people are shot in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand in the clear, shout and do something without being shot. He's going to go through an old factory and have the evil people go right into his reach without a fight. The villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> It's the whole story, not summed up, but in detail. Everything is pulled out with a guy standing ringing a doorbell. We are waiting with him. Long shots of guys get bored in the woods and sleep. We can take a nap with them. The one shot shot from following a female jogger could have been redeeming if we could see her ass or breasts jumping. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is less than Terminator and it's not because there is so much action. The signs just do not speak. And then they don't even have something corny to say like "I'll be back." If my buddy shot this weekend, I would greet him because it is a good idea to find out the camera's control. Paying money to rent this as a DVD is completely inappropriate. The only thing that is a little fun, is the extra thing about the director telling how the local police did not realize they were shooting and treating them like a random guy walking around with a gun. If they would have filmed it, I would be sure it would be more fun to watch the movie then.
