Are we talking about the same movie? This film is completely ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely logic. It is a typical direct to DVD / TV movie that contains all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: Transcendental has been actors, sidetracked from the plot, which is not explained. The GIRL shows her T * ts (why God, why?) People do not respond to things they wanted in real life. I don't even want to disturb you with details it would take all night. Well, OK, only one: If two people were murdered in front of you while walking down the street, one of the victims almost dies in your arms, his blood leaping from his head over you, your first concern would be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
