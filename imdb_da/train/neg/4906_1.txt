Well, I don't know where to start. It was clear that this was made for television films so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the second hour's overall direction, but something before or after seemed to be a paint of the numbers kind of movie. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between tow lovebird detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I'd go deeper, but this movie doesn't really deserve it. Degree: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
