If your idea of ​​entertainment looks graphic images of people being driven over by cars (you see a woman walking under the front wheel, gets twisted when the car passes over her before she goes under the rear wheel - and they show it twice) If you missed it for the first time, this is the documentary for you. I did not look at this very worrying piece of voyeurism any more, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for television networks to start showing slush movies. Perhaps game shows based on self-abuse can be nice. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that terrible things are happening. I don't need to see the evidence on the TV masquerading as entertainment.
