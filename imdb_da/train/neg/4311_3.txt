I watched this movie when I was a young boy full of raging hormones, and it was just as sexy a movie I had ever seen - or ever should see. It may not have been a good movie. My guess is that it wasn't. I don't really remember much about it, to tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie has ever done it to me as the incredibly sexy Cathy did in this movie. I haven't seen it since the first time I caught it on television in the 70s, and I don't think I'll see it again, since I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones are not so rage and I have become more jaded over the years. When I think back on the shower, I can still remember how well it felt way back then. <br /> <br /> Added later: After watching the movie again, I discovered it is dangerous to come home again. What was once erotic is now pretty pretty. The older woman-younger thing still works for me, just not as much as it once did, probably because I'm no longer a 12-year-old. The older woman is now younger than I am. Moreover, the amateurity of it all was not perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it is better not to revise the past.
