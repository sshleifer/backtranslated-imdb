The script is good. Although the casting is absolutely unclear. No style. the costumes do not resemble some of the High Highbury community. Comparison of Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Mrs Beckinsale speaks English English better than Mrs Paltrow, although Mrs Paltrow's play is Emma Woodhouse's character. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp and insensitive as Mr. Knightley in the TV version. P.S. The spectator cannot see Mr. at all. Elton-MS. The Smith relationship's development as it was in the movement version, so one cannot understand where was all Emma's attempt to make an Elton-Smith match (beyond the portrait).
