I have to admit that I'm a big fan of this show so you need to know how disappointed I got when I watched this movie. First and foremost, the plot was terrible, I thought it would be more interesting than seeing what happened to Arnold's fathers or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a madman will destroy Arnold's house between many other places, so many people trying to stop this. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the plot was not so bad, but what really sucked was the steps Arnold and his friends make to stop this madman, they become friends of a spy; they run a bus (based on a video game for God's sake), and to worse everything they do on the bus, things that many people have already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga because they are experts in a video games. Honestly, my mother, my sister, was even very disappointed after watching this movie, because it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I have to admit that I used to enjoy "Hey Arnold!" It was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after this movie I'm not sure if I should see "Hey Arnold!" as I used to look at the past. <br /> <br /> Other things Nickelodeon with the huge number of dynamites can assure you that not a simple street would explode, I think the whole city could explode with that Oh, and please, if all your future Movies from good comics become like this, don't make more movies, you give a bad criticism to cartoons that used to be good. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show turned into this crap movie.
