Nearly the beginning, after it has been established that the crime John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is an egoic rape, another bandit from the 1930s is the corner of a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. Second Commander Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson) examines the situations, sticks a lit cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded .45 caliber automatic and stalks out into the distant house alone. Afraid, scared, scared. Purvis comes alone out of the house and carries the female hostages, the miscreant dead. All in a long shot. <br /> <br /> If you are fond of stories like Red Riding Hood, it should have a great appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it is mindless. Pretty Boy Floyd meets dramatically. More violations of the citizen code. Lots of shoot outs with Tommy pistols and guns. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> As a story, it stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, partly I guess because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in pursuit of public attention himself. <br /> <br /> The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He is the guy who had written it in his contract that if any animal was shot and killed during one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. Milius is the guy, a compleat pistol freak who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War-Writing quotes from Henry V - "Saint Crispin's Day" and all that. Exciting, yes, and finished waste. "I knew I would never take him alive, nor did I try hard." That is, kill them all and let God sort them out. <br /> <br /> You just want to love it.
