I cannot believe that this wooden plate written and straightened piece of clich√© film has been made. There are about four beautiful pictures (the instructor should think about switching to still photography), and that's it. A strong casting is completely wasted, scenes repeating repeatedly in the least interesting moments, and the manuscript does not say anything new. Save yourself this movie.
