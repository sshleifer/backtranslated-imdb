I thought they should have called this movie "Whites" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so self-confident and think their lives are so important ... give me a break. Such a lily white cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in it, screamed this movie out of someone really coming in and stealing it ... and then introducing it, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (I thought he was an albino at the start) who should be welsh! I'm still trying to decipher this accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of movie that is capable of fooling so many people into believing it's worth it because it has traps of something more ambitious. Better to fill the theaters with MI5-10 than with this pretentious crap ... must have been a better game because you can't fall off the floor.
