I question its importance for Queer Cinema, as it seems to be more about having a gay encounter through violent behavior than making clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are intertwined in a rather sloppy way. I tried to remove that messy tale for the first 15 minutes, it alone wasn't good for me. Weak plot points were infinitely repeated as if we might not have got it the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of padded dialogue throughout the movie. More like a 45 minute Boy's Short card rather than a fleshed out full length movie. It had some erotic flair, male nudity and sex appeal, but the total amount didn't sum its parts. First part: The Boxer / Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it also felt that it had been drawn thinly. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he facing him? I felt that their cat-mouse games were not developed enough to interpret their conclusion. We needed more information about them and the smaller parking lot / locker scenes with Tim and said relentlessly "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his friend Tony to beat him up while he goes out. Tony does not seem to mind, but he does not even seem interested in exploring the consequences of his gay erotic hobby - not even after they have done so. This story lacks the important transition from "I'm a straight boy who tastes my guy friend for fun" to "I think I can be gay and beat him because I want to spread his ass and make him S / M style. " A very important thing to leave. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these stories could have conveyed their points in half the time. The third part with the man and the woman who are around each other adds to that thinking. Moreover, it was unnecessary and added nothing to the movie. Yes, the actors did a good job under the circumstances and the four male drivers were very sexy. Make-up (bruises and cuts), however, was on a par with a high school talent show. There was not enough meat for this story to get any influence on homosexual policy. The film made no statement, wasted time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thought-provoking investments. Its fatal error is its amateurish approach, making it ultimately impossible to take seriously.
