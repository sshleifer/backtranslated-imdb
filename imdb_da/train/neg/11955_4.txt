"Visitor Q" is an unsuccessful attempt at black comedy that focuses on what may be the world's most dysfunctional family, including physical assault from murder to murder to incest to sodomy for the necrophilia of a nursing mother nursing her husband and adult daughter etc. The film is so monstrous that it has received some critical praise and established a little cult afterwards. But with home video quality and a slapdash production, "Visitor Q" just doesn't hold up as a curiosity. Genitals are blurred and hygiene devices clearly visible, makeup is terrible, and everything else is at best amateur. A waste of time. (C)
