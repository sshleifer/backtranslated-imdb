This movie has an interesting plot, but the play is pretty bad, and the manuscript is poor. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the protagonist is an exciting one, but due to poor writing and casting, this potentially winning achievement is looted. 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after approx. 45 minutes and the other 2 laughed at how bad the movie was. I put it to the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.
