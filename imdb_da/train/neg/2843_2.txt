Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, no mistake. But it's also an incredible fun. This is largely due to the amazing presence of a Chuck Connors, which is considered the lead in the movie, but really shines only in a few scenes. I suppose he should be a kind of Obi Wan Kenobi type ("The Hard Ninja Busters"), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of mental retardation, not of the highest concentration. <br /> <br /> But really, his two helpers, Sonny and Dennis, have such a horrible dialogue as "Brooklyn" that we call Colonel tends to shine in comparison. Particularly beware of Dennis' logic of 'genetic splicing' in which Sakura is involved. If you know anything about cloning, you will die laughing. And yes, this is a great plot point, people. <br /> <br /> A terribly fun movie, Sakura Killers is a hard to find gem. I won't spoil the "trick" that ends for you, except that it's a perfect set for a Sakura Killers 2. Too bad Chuck Connor's died. :-( Because he has a smoothest way to blow away ninjas.
