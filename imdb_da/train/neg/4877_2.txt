Frank Capra's creativity must have been about to be used when making this film. Although it has some charming moments and many wonderful artists, Capra's direct reuse of not only the manuscript, but significant footage from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is even lukewarm. It is understandable that he will reuse recordings from the climactic horse racing that is exciting. But he uses whole dialogue scenes with smaller actors, then brings them back to these actors and apparently does not expect us to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last looks, skip this and watch Broadway Bill instead.
