I do not give much faith in AIDS conspiracy theories, but it is sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the frightened and dying often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the political radical and sexually extreme demi-mon in San Francisco. The town, known for its beauty, has rarely appeared ugly than in this movie. A sense of darkness and degradation permeates every scene. <br /> <br /> Although the play and plot cannot be said to be well done, the movie's unique cultural context and repressive dark mood, at least partially saves the movie from being a complete loss. In fact, I found the most interesting achievement to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Politician. She is interesting, but not necessarily convincing. Highlights: The movie's use of the ugly tragic Turandot is an effective motif, and there is a sublime silent thumb of iconic performance artist Ron Athey.
