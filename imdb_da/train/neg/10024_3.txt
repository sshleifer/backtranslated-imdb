First lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just 'style' doesn't sell. I guess Tashan when translated means style. Second, if you're hell bent on selling style, it doesn't save you from having a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that could have been enough with some better instructors. But it's not smooth. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are storytellers at various points in history. But this setup is not utilized properly. There could have been a better mix and match of their stories. Action sequences are from the 70s. <br /> <br /> Choreography of the movie is horrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleeps, went through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar has scored a good score, but it does not belong to this movie. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the black Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the scanty grace of the movie. But he is in his stereotype himself. You don't want to miss this movie.
