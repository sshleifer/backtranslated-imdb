No need to bother renting this flick. From the opening circle I knew I was in trouble. It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie, but there really is nothing erotic about it. The prospect of sex addiction is exciting, but only to one point. Drilling sex scenes, bad plot and cameos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette is not enough to save this movie.
