Apart from the better than average action skills of the two leaders, this movie is really, really bad. The cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you will not notice that the production values ​​are cheap if they did not continue to try to convince you that they had a production value at first. Even for a B-movie genre freak like myself, this movie really sucks.
