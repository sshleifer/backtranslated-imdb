I have seen it. It is not "good" but interesting in a discreet way. The boys in it are quite naturalistic, but ................ the graphic / gratuitous final rape scene is contradictory and - yes yes - the arbitrary deployment of World War II recordings is offensive in the way It tries to compare true horror with this misogynistic controversy. Real cruelty is real - this movie is just awful. However, the film has a look that can draw you in. But it seems to me that it is "the Emperor's new clothes", but in fact the other way around. The movie looks good, but the direction, the story, the content and the final feeling you take away from this movie are vacuum. If a feeling can be vacuous- this is it.
