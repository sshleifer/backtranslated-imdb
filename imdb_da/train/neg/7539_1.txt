How oh, where do you start by describing the widespread misery of Neil LaBute's recent film production attempt? <br /> <br /> There are many kinds of movie fans out there, but by far the most annoying and superficial is Mr. Intriguing. You know Mr. Intriguing, right? <br /> <br /> He's the guy that no matter how stupid, lame, and incredibly boring a movie is, he says, "Gee, I don't know why everyone hated it, I found it exciting." He is the kind of guy who finds the smell of dog bites fascinating. Especially when he throws it in the form of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches on the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction, containing sparsely blurred references to Greek mythology. He is also the guy this version of The Wicker Man was made for. No one else could stop it.
