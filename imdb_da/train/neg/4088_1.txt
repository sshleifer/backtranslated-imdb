This was a water source event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was totally amazed at how bad it was. Movies like this make you doubt who buys the money and who owes a favor - a very, very great service. The special effects are absolutely first class levels that could have made them in every first degree. Toy rubber bats on cords without attempting to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the movie and look like an arrow you will find on a street sign and a ridiculous story. Ed Wood did masterpieces in relation to "Conquest". Every film student should see this thing just so they can know the very definition of a bad movie.
