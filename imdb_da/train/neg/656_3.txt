Note: I couldn't force myself to actually write a constructive review of Prom Night. It just can't be done. Instead, I went through what I was thinking about while watching movies. <br /> <br /> Things I thought about while watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of the dreams that these elaborate deaths will take only for the protagonist of to wake up just before she bites it. Of course, when I say "elaborate deaths", I mean slipping or slashing my stomach. Wasn't the whole "it's just a dream" thing ruined by Dallas? Talk about whether or not I wonder if a couple stinging in the gut will cause immediate death. The <br /> <br /> movie is only ten minutes in, and I can already count the horror clich√©s on two hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Just after meeting the protagonist's boyfriend, I'm convinced he'll die. Someone wants to place bets? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this movie is a teacher who is obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think "Donna" is a terrible name for the protagonist of a horror movie?) He spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds Donna celebrating his high school prom. Although there is no accounting for taste, I really wonder who would take the time to steal someone as boring as Donna. <br /> <br /> - High schools allow proms to take place in hotels and do not control students. Apparently, the students are quite able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please. I suppose if this plot point wasn't in place, the movie would be 90 minutes people bored out of their minds and randomly biting the dust as they walked to the toilet. I suppose the trade-off for their excitement is my complete boredom with everything. I've already played "count pieces of gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only in the 20 minute mark. How else will I entertain myself? <br /> <br /> -Also yourself: Don't forget milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> -The scriptwriter: You've used enough fake scares to get through this movie and any other horror generations this year. <br /> <br /> -The 1980s version of this movie was not that good, but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane or at least The Godfather. It had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many post-Halloween horror flicks, and it had a little "twist" in the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she would do more. <br /> <br /> -Apparently on prom there is not much dance going on. Instead, the girls fight with their boyfriends over where they plan to go to college. I hear that all these colleges are brought up by name and I cannot do without, but who these girls should cheat on at the entrance to the exam. <br /> <br /> -Manager must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and dry up in his mess between scenes. That's the only logical explanation why he could put someone to death on the carpet or in the bathroom, and when someone goes up to the hotel room, there's no trace of a fight. (On another side note: This is a very lazy murderer. Michael Myers was hunting for his victims. Just saying.) It is official: the entire audience in the theater reveals the killer. What triggered it? Was it when Donna went back to his hotel room while sirens went out and ordered everyone to leave the building? Was it her constant dreams, and where even after having gone through something dramatic in the dream, did she insist on restoring her steps to a tee? Or was it Brittany Snow's convincing performance? I have to say that it was all above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who had "he die of the screen in the third act"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> -Finally, the movie is over. My friend turns around and says "Donna wasn't too smart." It's the understatement of the week. One form of saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week-long power outage is a small inconvenience. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get on rat tomatoes and see if anyone gave this move a favoriting review. <br /> <br /> - I can't recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. It's just as lazy of a horror movie as anything, and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you're under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for theater consultants alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Rating: * Out of ****
