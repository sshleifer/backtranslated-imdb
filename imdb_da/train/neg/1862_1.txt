It is not just the plot itself that makes this movie an immediate end to the public. It is the terrible direction with a horrible script and the errors to the left and right that also make this disturbing to see. I'm sorry, but I can't see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing to the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well, I wonder how stupid the managers think of their producing company when this film was introduced. Probably as stupid as the sheriff who is pushing into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a yawning bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff is not only a bad actor, but also can push up an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed meat? I guess he was forgotten when he won a not so exciting victory over the snow.
