<br /> <br /> One would expect a movie featuring a famous comedian in the lead, to be a fun movie. This is not the case here. I laughed loudly once in the whole movie and it wasn't even under the final comedy scene (which one would also expect to be the funniest). This is one you can see when it comes to television, don't spend any other money to rent it.
