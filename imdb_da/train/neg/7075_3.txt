This is certainly the third remake of this movie, so if you see it, there is a feeling of deja vu, don't be surprised. All they did was change the story and tell it differently, but the differences are not significant. And it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawless at first. It never works. And like its predecessors, the play is mediocre. The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen the movie before, but the ending does not fit the story. Had this movie completed ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and been very satisfying, and I would have thought it worthwhile. But here are spoiler and that ultimately crime pays because criminals are not caught. I never like this message because of a movie.
