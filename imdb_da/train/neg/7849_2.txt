The film captures, after last year's remake with the military, electronic surveillance equipment in the desert, where the attacks in the first film occurred. The crew is not killed long before a group of soldiers on a training show to find no one around. You can fill the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a payslip image around. There seems to be no passion in any concept or in any behind the camera. This is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else. At some level this should have worked, it could have been a more horrible southern comfort (where the national guards run afoul of some people in the swamps), but instead it's not much of anything. In large part you can blame the script, written incredibly partly by Wes Craven, who hits the same old targets over and over again. Add to the root of the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lacking in gloss to remove any built-in voltage in any scene. It is not bad as such, but poorly made and boring. Let me put my feelings into the context: The reason I saw this movie was because a local multiplex turned up and drove this movie instead of the kids, smiled Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the outbreak (I mean, that the films have a lot in common - he says sarcastically). I am convinced that this movie will only scare those who like the last Mimzy.
