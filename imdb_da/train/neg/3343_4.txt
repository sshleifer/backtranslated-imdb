Interesting story of a soldier in a war who misses to save a young girl's life from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even though he saved many other captive children. The movie flashes his head and this soldier is now a high school teacher who is managed mainly by police officers patrolling times, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison, and most of the children pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays soldier / school teacher and decides that he will stop teaching and enter another field. The principal, however, asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film, when all hell is lost and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you have decided to see it!
