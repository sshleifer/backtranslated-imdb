A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all tied up in some stupid plot or something. It is easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone realize that this movie makes light of child murder? I suppose it's OK because it's a teenage boy - if we had one with a man who seduces a teenage girl, there would (rightly) be anger. Sorry, but having it done to a boy does not apologize. It's still sick. I realize Brown was old (he was actually 18 when this was made), but he solves 15. I just find it disturbing that some people find it OK. Plot aside the actor sucks (Kristel is beautiful - but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst children's actors I've ever seen), and the constant nudity becomes boring and is not even far erotic. I saw this drive at a theater back in 1981. I was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass to 18). He wanted to see it - I didn't, but I decided what was bad? We came in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were of course minors. My cousin thought was boring and the other three kids left half way through! Let me make it clear - three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity! It should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I'm surprised this was ever released. A 1 all the way.
