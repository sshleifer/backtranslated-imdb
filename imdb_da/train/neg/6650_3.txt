I think it would have been a much better movie if Cajuns had been portrayed in a more credible light. My family is from the southeast of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up talking to as these people did. Cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people and do not sound undeveloped at all when they speak the way these people did. All in all, it was an OK movie with great scenery and music. I understand that the authors were from Lake Charles and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, you must have the actors study the language, live among the people you portray and get an understanding of how they are before you trying to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you think they are the person, it is a much more enjoyable movie!
