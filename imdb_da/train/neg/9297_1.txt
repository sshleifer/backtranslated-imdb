I gave this a 1. There are so many plot phrases that you can never be sure to mess with. Total chaos. Everyone is killed or almost so. I'm tired of cross hairs and changing views. I can't give the plot away. Envelope and insane. If I had paid to see this I would claim my money back. I wish the reviews were more honest.
