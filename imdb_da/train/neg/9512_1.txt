I can't believe it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times. (probably because of how stupid it was) If someone paid me to watch the movie again, I wouldn't. The reason was so horrible, it had no meaning, and the play was so bad that I couldn't even tell if they were trying. the movie was horrible rating: F
