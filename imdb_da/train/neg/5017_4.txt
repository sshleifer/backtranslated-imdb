Just finished this movie ... saw it on the video shelf and be a Nick Stahl fan, I just had to rent it. Frankly, it should have been on the shelf. The concept was an interesting one, and there were several pretty clever words, but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they came together. And the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion ... if you have to suffer through a show of it, then you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> With a positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same kind of character ... too much Paul Finch from "American Pie" comes through to my taste. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie has to be January Jones' numb performance ... I think a beautiful face is really all that matters in Hollywood.
