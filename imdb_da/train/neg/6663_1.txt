I can't hold this show! Has there ever been another redeeming quality, a fun punchline or a plot line that "didn't" mean the average viewer will drown himself in a bowl of sucked cornflakes? <br /> <br /> The voices. Oh, those awful, miserable voices. Akin to repeatedly draw a set of fine cutlery across a dusty board is each character particularly annoying in his or her ability of sharp, nasal vocal. Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew, and Timmy's father makes every line sound like a bad look of a game show host (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" comes to mind). <br /> <br /> The animation is horrible; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the overwhelmingly poor artwork on this show. Each character has buck teeth or a square head or head three sizes too large for his or her body. And what about getting the characters to speak every single line with broad eyes and grinning, as if putting a picture up with the president? Then there is the fact that each character on the show is completely moronic. Not since the strange grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck of "Charles in Charge" fame have been depicted signs as so unrealistically silly. Usually, "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unfunny" and that is certainly the case here. There has not been so much slapstick based on cluelessness since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (and it's every episode so big time warnings here) was: Timmy wants something with his two "Just Odd Parents", something goes wrong, there's always a thorough reason for that he cannot immediately turn the course and wish away the damage, and then everything just fine in the end. Oh, and on a side note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they continue to hire her at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a children's show that contains the subtle message that it doesn't really do anything at all to tell about a violent babysitter is probably not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing a paper and want to quote an example of how far the quality of comics has fallen, "The Fair Odd Parents" should be a great place to start. An excellent example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at children with little or no effort, simply because they know someone will see it somewhere.
