I was interested in watching this movie because I knew it was Christian based. The director had a good idea / intention when making this movie, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone will still have feelings about who they think is the greatest love in their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mediocre, and rude. The protagonist apologized to his friends as they were the ones who meant to him. They did not understand at all, and they used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The protagonist or no one else did not know if ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married etc, but they were against him by solving old feelings that had to be dealt with. His friends were supposed to be Christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive, whether or not they agreed on his decision. So many times we do things in life where we do not apologize to those we have done in the past, and when he tried to do so, they were all against him. The ironic part was his new female friend accusing him of having stalking behavior just to look up an old friend when she did a really strange thing to grab his name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be stalking !. she didn't seem like a friend at all, but only looked at herself. God is love ... and I believe God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with, and I feel the movie did a terrible injustice by getting it to seem like God doesn't care about true love ... only what you stay with someone you've made a bad choice with. We make every mistake ... it's about what steps you take to make changes. As I said the film had potential, but I was tired of the one-sided view, it was constantly repeated and attached to the viewers neck of his so-called ... well-meaning friends. This film did not believe in the Christian belief in love, but I give it a C for its efforts.
