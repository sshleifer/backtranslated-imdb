This film is a good example of how to use media manipulation to sell a movie that is no more than a very unique television sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has written about the marvel in this movie and almost silent everyone else. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the form and content of the film and pointed out all its faults, clich√©s and bad writing. Just because a movie makes a part of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes, and because you can recognize actors and scenes, don't make it an acceptable movie.
