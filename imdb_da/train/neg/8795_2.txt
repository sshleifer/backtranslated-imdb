I saw almost no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's apparently crazy obsession for it ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe it's a decent quality. Overall, I found this movie surreal and ridiculous. The hand-held film production combined with slow motion and other movie gimmicks, I found clumsy and staggering, even disease. All in all, the music was terribly horrible and repeated to the extreme and reminds me of the American military's psychological war against various malcontents. The various vignettes that made up the film are random in their location and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and "conclusions". A depressing movie (not a real _film_, an expression I reserve for real art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe in the various people who try to turn this as a "romantic comedy", although there are certainly isolated elements in both of these films, rejecting content, form, and conclusion any attachment to this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest staying far away despite seemingly overwhelmingly positive views on IMDb and other rating sources.
