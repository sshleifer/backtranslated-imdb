This is one of the most hateful and horrible movies I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, I was asked to stick to it when Donald Sutherland's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility. [This is the last time that happens.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warrens characters were annoyingly whiny and stupid as they come. There were smarter characters than her who were killed in the movie. It's just one of many things in this movie that made me ask, "Where's the justice?" Why is sennat cable so full of sadistic garbage filled with pathological chaos? Most of these movies seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on being terrorized and murdered. This film could have been just as exciting without being sick and twisted in the process. All it ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with its illness and insulting the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Casting is misleadingly good. My guess is that they first beat Sutherland and used him to lure the others as lemmings in this. <br /> <br /> I am kicking myself to waste time, giving this waste a chance.
