I can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about a question like homelessness. Of course, Brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy land, so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often. Brooks' films have become worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
