Oh, love me! Rarely has a "horror" movie bored me, or made me laugh, as much as this one. After an exciting start with an exciting performance, it falls into not much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual sides. The usually excellent Alice Wars are wasted in this one, and the plot twists are ridiculous. Don't disturb unless you're really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
