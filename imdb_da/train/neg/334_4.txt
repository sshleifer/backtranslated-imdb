Bad movie safe. It is such a ridiculous fantasy with many bad special effects, many fast scenes (such as the airport) and a real unfunny time. (Charles Dance) is horrible as the evil guy and he is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) does a non-comic fun, and I heard that this submerged had already succeeded, great time success ?? !! I never understand why or how? In a TV interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, undoing it in a comical way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic stupidity that has made many RAZZIE films over the years, whether it's the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons that made me write about this movie. The first is that I will never forget Charlotte Lewis' long, fascinating legs, especially when she was on the bed before the evil attacked her house, just had a blue shirt and the OH BOY camera was deepening about her naked legs like that should be. But so weird! As I've seen her follow movies and she wasn't that beautiful again? !! Anyway, the other reason I found this movie title lately is on my list of the worst 100 movies ever! Bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
