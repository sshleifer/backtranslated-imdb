This movie has such relentless class B affordability to all its scenes, effects, etc. To make you believe they spent 80% of their budget at Connery. It's like watching some Wing Commander stuff after Star Wars (except for content). History can be described in a word: FLAT. And oh my God, I can't remember a villain so uninteresting since long ago. We also do not get a reason why he is so evil (a born defect we lead to thinking :) or any real conviction or flair to his evil. <br /> <br /> If you are out of Connery, rather, hire `Hunting Forrester '.
