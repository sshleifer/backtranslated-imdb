Seriously, there is absolutely no good with this crap party at all. Randolph Scott, a closet gay who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is in his most timid and tedious role. At 57, he was obviously too old for these romantic roles, although it doesn't matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years, and she is so nasty because of her chronic alcoholism and chain diving. Lee Marvin plays his usual evil role, but saving this waste is not enough. Thank goodness, they don't do westerns anymore, they are just dated, racist old movies that glamorize weapons and murders. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
