The entire Biker Movie genre must consist of the worst movies ever made. This one gives a lot of battles, generous amounts of blood, cyclists who fight Indians and a shanty town that is blown up and torn down a cabin at a time. The action is beyond terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just got away. This movie really blows, but if you haven't seen a Biker movie for a long time, it's good to see. At the end of the movie, you need to feel a little sweet because you've seen it!
