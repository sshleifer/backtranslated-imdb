This movie was screened as part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I had no expectations for the movie as someone else chose it for me. <br /> <br /> I actually like movies that take time to develop, movies that allow the characters to unfold and let the story flow. Stillness is good. However, this movie was just slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to the two main players. There was a sense of excitement between them as two very different people who really fail come together in a very awkward way. There were sore moments and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, and it was added to the intimacy of the movie and reinforced the inequality of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand the end. What was the meaning of it all?
