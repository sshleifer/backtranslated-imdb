WOW! I didn't know anyone would make this movie! It's terrible! I've written 5 things that can tell why you don't want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> number 1: "is the biggest rave ever" where is the rave? I could only see a few people dancing around .. <br /> <br /> 2. When they are on rave, they can only see blood everywhere, no people, two broken tents and one stage .. and what do they do! ? they drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his crew .. terrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people shoots a regular gun, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I didn't know that everybody in the world could fight like a pro! must be a new thing .. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the manufacturer was thinking! "This will be a big hit, it will be a classic" .. sure you are stupid s ** t can't see this movie anyway, it's a talk time. My eyes are still bleaching!
