Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal of GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic if Lambert had performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Too bad because the storyline is meaningful to us in life were the superb performances of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters superb. 3 out of 10.
