I can find very little that is good to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and the script looked so good on paper, but I'm scared of filmography and acting that I'm not expecting from some very talented ones. I would doubt that this is very high in their CV filmography. Michael Caine sometimes appeared in his role as a doctor, and in no time did I not believe in his character. The reason was incredible, especially with regard to the victims' son. Some of the scenes were reminiscent of other films that I sometimes wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller. The light at times was dark, and it was added to the feeling of seeing a low budget movie with some big named stars and wondering why I was bothering to even see it.
