Why is it that any movie about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in film making? Regardless of the attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of all of them, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seem to be on the screen as other than the champions of high school high school students. Despite lavish sets and costumes, this movie is just as bad as any Italian "sandals and toga" extravaganza from the 50's. This kind of spectacular certainly belongs to the big screen, why "Gladiator" went well, but "Gladiator" did not have all Romanesque romancex. Miss Varela has as little actor talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has the talent to save. Shame some of it did not wash off the others.
