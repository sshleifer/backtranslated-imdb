In the unlikely event that some aspiring directors read these comments, I would like to offer some advice (for free!), From a viewer's perspective. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a spear of exotic adventure movies, go ahead. Do NOT try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, if you have a foggy "comic relief" character killed and beheaded and followed it with a monkey shaking a tree and releasing a coconut on a cannibal's head, you just look like you had no idea of ​​what kind of movie you would make. This one is boring, chronic, cheap, racist .... you get the picture. A few chic moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten about the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
