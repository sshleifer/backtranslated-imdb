Hilariously obviously "drama" about a bunch of high school (I think) children enjoying non-stop hip-hop, breaking dance, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at Roxy - or something. To be honest, I was so boring that I forgot it! Even people who love the music agree that this movie is terribly acted upon and - as a drama - failed. We must find these children cozy and cozy. I found them bland and boring. The one I really hated was Ramon. He does graffiti at subway stations and it looks so good. Excuse me? He damages public property that is not his first. Also, these "big" children tap into the city's electricity so that they can hold a large dance life in an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we had to find a bunch of offenders loved and fun. <br /> <br /> I could forgive everything if the music was good, but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and they were nonstop! They NEVER play! It came to the point that I was fast forwarding through the many endless music tracks. (Cut out the music and you have a 30 minute movie - maybe). There are a few imaginative numbers - the metro dance game, a really fun Santa number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love hip hop here is your movie. But what you're looking for good drama mixed in - forget it. Also, how did this get a PG rating? There is an incredible amount of swears in this.
