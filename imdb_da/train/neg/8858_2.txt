Ben an out-of-town policeman is convinced that his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring the killer to court, but he is approached by Stefan, who believes his sister was the victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to bring an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> These are incredibly awful b-class stuff and I wondered how it even got released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, as this must be his worst achievement I've seen. <br /> <br /> It was very wrong with this real movie, ranging from the really hammy and wood performances by Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not forgotten Lee), cheesy fashion (the sunnies) cheap and lame special effects, poor use of lighting, humor ... if there were any trashy 80s music (with some of the movie just focusing on some unknown band playing), werewolf having orgies, which is a sight to watch and a tiring story with flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was so bad it would be terribly fun, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives were the location and the settings of the movie looked good, but it's about it ... in fact, I also add Sybil Danning short stripping scene. End Credits The band plays their crap-house song during a strange montage of scenes from the movie, which I look at the question why? <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
