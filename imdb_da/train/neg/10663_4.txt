The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between. But the women thrown gave a pretty good show than the men who were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really stared in the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in the bed that involved Krista should have shortened, but she made it so clever and sexier than anyone could. Christ really is one of the best in such roles. She also quietly filed as a baddie in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good and it wasn't his best as an action star. He could have chosen a better script than this. Really he thinks he did for money.
