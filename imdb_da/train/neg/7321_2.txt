Maybe not my genre, but plot horrible, which was acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of being seduced here (on marijuana? Why would it be necessary to include this weakened plot significantly). Also Farentinos charac. would have been better if she had more respect for a relationship. Would that movie try to say? little.
