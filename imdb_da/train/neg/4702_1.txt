I hate this movie. I hate the show. I almost hate everything about it. It's so annoying and stupid. everyone says that night and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they have to make it big. WHAT kind of drugs are you taking ??? !!!?!?!?!?! night and alex will end up as either hobos or ends as Jane Hudson from "What ended with Baby Jane?". I could only get through not even 20 minutes of this, barely 30 seconds of the show, and I managed to survive about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. days before the movie premiere at Nick, most of the teenage girl actresses at Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in a commercial influence of brain dead young on how awesome night and alex wolff are. first, they didn't, and I thought enough that night and alex probably either pulled them or paid them lots of money to say it and obeyed convincingly because I can't see how anyone could find this show / movie entertaining . the music is just awful. Night song sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movie / tv show character ever. he is not funny, he is annoying, he is really weird and he thinks he is warm and knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he ever manages to be laid. you know this show is false when you find out that some of the characters (in fact) don't even exist !! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin Jesse Draper (they must have some budget problems). Their father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear on the show, making Wolff's mothers less mothers. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, the naked brothers are going to be in deep sh ** when their "fans" find out that whole things are staged. 0/10
