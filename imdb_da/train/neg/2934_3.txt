Simon Pegg stars as Sidney Young, a stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit working as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. Having had a very lucky break, he starts working on the highly respected Sharps magazine, which is run by a reliable form at Jeff Bridges in New York. It's More The Devil wears Prada than the Dead of Shaun. The unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for laughs, but they do not completely clarify the screen ablaze with their passion. Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to determine if he should forget his journalistic principles for getting material in the magazine. Of course, he is eventually seduced by the glory and glamor of the celebrities world, especially the young star Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself has ever experienced similar feelings in reality with this movie and to a large extent run Fat Boy Run as one of Britain's best comic talents destroyed by the United States . /> <br /> All in all, this is an unforgettable comedy. Please come back to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
