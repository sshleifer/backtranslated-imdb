Having come low expectation, the opening of new recordings (clocked in over five minutes) of 'Men' came as a pleasant surprise. I would not say that the new recording was Class A material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what "could have been" a good all-original movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was assembled in 1955, during a time of one day shooting plans. After the new recordings, Jules White decided to just thumb stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' to this short, giving a not so smooth story transition as Jules and Felix Adler are trying to fix with a quick bit of new recordings ending, giving us the old , worn end of boys (Moe & Larry in this case) are shot in the butt. <br /> <br /> 3/10
