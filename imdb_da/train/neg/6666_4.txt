I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I don't want to spoil this movie - don't worry right from the start, you know something bad will happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this movie was put together. Cowboy and "Twig" ride up the back. Cowboy has a handle bar mustache. Cowboy and "Twig" enter a shooting and drive halfway down the back. Cowboy is clean shaven through the rest of the movie. Meanwhile, between the gun battle and the trip down the mountain, the cowboy has had time to shave in the dark on a horse's back. To be fair, the play of the four main characters is solid.
