I had actually hoped for this movie since I have seen Kari in a few other things and think she has some talent. Alas, this dud is a case study on what not to do in a manuscript. Absolutely undefined characters without a forging of equality, and no plot at all. Is it a road / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, nor do we.
