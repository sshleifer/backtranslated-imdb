Fans of Goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they record this movie for his usual pants of blood that slammed, because there is a little bit of a blockage in blood filming in this movie. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell the bizarre story, relying on special coupon dealers on a budget that could probably have doubled if the cast had beaten their pockets for change one day. Strangely, while cheap and very badly acted (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the overall outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout. Imagine what this movie might have been like with a decent budget! Overall, it tastes like champagne on a beer budget.
