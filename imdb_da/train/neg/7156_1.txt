Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well it certainly does after this endurance test of a movie. How on earth did I manage to go on without pushing the fast forward button that master only knows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I don't get the prerequisite for the movie ... or maybe I don't appreciate the alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the film has as much mysterious atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> Also, the character was all terrible and there is more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing it? why do i see such a step? It's enough to get one to run away and join a monastery or foreign legion !! YAARGH !! An absolutley horrible movie in almost every respect. Apart from that, it's not bad.
