A class-Z horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most productive directors operating in the low budget gory mayhem field. A mysterious black garment figure is violently murdering guests who live on the family mansion. Unfortunately, this film is almost bloodless. You actually do not see the murders except with shadows and a few blood spots. The pace is dull and the plot is quite uninteresting. The action is just competent, but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous 4 out of 10. Just beware: Don't miss Monson's movie with Andy Milligy's equally weak "Legacy of Blood".
