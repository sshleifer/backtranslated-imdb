A very weak movie, mainly due to a bad story, but also bad acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and the irrational behavior of many of the characters. If you are a person who likes to change your mind and just watch a movie for its creativity or play, then you like this movie. Personally, I can't do it with a drama and found it too slow. <br /> <br /> I am particularly annoyed when a protagonist, who should be an intelligent person, continually acts as a complete idiot. In this movie, if the main character seemed like a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> The first very unlikely action is when the protagonist, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves a party and happens on a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who screams her car has been stolen. They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he bestows her to accept a trip home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about her strange father, who belongs to some kind of strange sect and does crazy things. When they come to her fake cabin in the poorer part of town, they notice that her car is in the driveway. The house light is also lit and some objects in the house have been broken. Things are very strange, she's strange (looks like a tramp, she dresses in front of him until she's completely naked? Oh Yeah!). Also the father is strange, the house is a wreck - everything must have told Magruder, "Hey it's too strange for me, I'm from here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then motivated by his story and sex he takes care of trying to get his father obliged. It's all screaming up! <br /> <br /> So, the top-flight lawyer is that he is arriving late in the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before (a fact that all the women on the office message). Is it likely that a successful lawyer would act as a 16-year-old? Magruder has disturbed the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police and claims his father is terrorizing them, the police ignore him. I could have thought begrudging assistance. But no help at all - not likely! <br /> <br /> It's just too unlikely.
