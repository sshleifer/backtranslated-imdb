What a horrible movie. I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes in my life and looked at this remake. Tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer were in this movie? Mehki Pfifer is great in E.R and Ving Rhames probably didn't know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The music background I have to say didn't fit on ALLLLL with the story, and it's great how to find those directors who absolutely have no life in creating a well-balanced movie. I hope that no director in the future would be as horrible as this one could ever ruin such a great classic movie. This movie should not have been made in the first place. An advice for anyone who has seen it, tell me I'm right because I couldn't be the only viewer who didn't like it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10
