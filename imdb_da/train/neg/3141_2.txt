I just had the evidence to confirm my suspicions. A bunch of children, 14 to 22 put on the DVD "Titanic" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they had all seen Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most felt that they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic began, they began to be restless, some of them left asking the others - "call us when the iceberg appears". Over an hour and a half in the movie, only the two girls who had seen the film were still there. They started shouting: icebergs, icebergs. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed and released Ohs and dad outs. So, as I thought, the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? An hour and a half is waiting for the bloody thing to sink, but what about the rest of it. Dr. For example, Zivagho had a similar running time, but think about how much is going on in that movie within the same time period. In "Titanic" Leo Kate learns how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of supposedly cream de la creme in the ship's first-class dining room. Look at the historical details if you can find them. The story is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings into a ship that is about to sink. The real sink here is movie standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and opening weekends. The movie continued to become the highest-selling movie all the time, so what do I know?
