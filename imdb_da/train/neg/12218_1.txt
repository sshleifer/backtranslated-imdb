Very bad. Very, very bad. As a guy who strives to do, be in or - at least - turn the catering table into a movie set, I find it hard to criticize independent people who have actually got a movie of every kind made. But this movie ... Oh, dear. Realizing Frightworld does not strive for anything more than raw exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to try to do so in accordance with more general standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it's more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not too much. So I won't try to criticize, just let me ask for some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the point in the movie, shouldn't you be able to see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you rent, three sound men should make sure at least one knows how to use the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your wire giant should be frightening than a smurf. Difficult I know, but really ... 4) There are many talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of whom you can hire really cheap. Get one who knows how to hit a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he has to do it every two seconds. <Br /> <br /> 6) Kudos to get the girls to take their tops out, but next time, get girls who are tops we want to take off. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood. At least in this kind of movie editing should sell gore gags. A chainsaw that suddenly appears in a sign is not scary, it's sloppy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all actors were bad. Jack was quite good and I liked Acid when she started fighting back. There was some nice imagery, unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without any rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like Moxie from Frightworld. Next time, now that they have a movie of their kind under their belts, I hope everyone involves striving for something better than Colman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
