During the Christmas holidays, a group of fellow friends will be behind to help prepare the dorms for being demolished and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the work a little harder, a murderous, chucks-wearing psycho walks in the dorm halls that characterize the group in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of the 74 video nasties performed by the United Kingdom in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built up for it before the first show. The term "video nasty" hits some pictures of some very explicit gore, violence, sex, etc.: All the things a horror fan dreams of. So after hearing all that information, I decided to go to Pranks (everything Title), which expects a sleazy slash experience. . . And that was what it was trying to be, but almost completely failed. Visually, the film is not amazing. The camera does (except for a few scenes) and the overall direction fails. It is simply not fun to see. The unoriginal script is missing and often throws in random things without any real reason (such as the opening kill). There are some cool death scenes, including a beautiful, beautiful face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but it is about the positive ones. The action is pretty bad, the story seems insignificant, the killer is not cool or scary, and it suffers the only big mistake that any slasher flick should always avoid: it's a bit boring. All in all, for a movie by a couple of UCLA movie students to $ 90,000 (which would be more than twice as much today), Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a complete mess. It has a few good things, and it's pretty reliable. . . But as a slasher girl seems to be on par with movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . It just can't be compared. Don't expect much and you can at least be entertained. I hate to say that, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that would actually be better with a remake. . . and yet they go after great works like black christmas. Oh good. . . <br /> <br /> Mandatory Horror Elements: <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some brutally cool killings and gore is okay for it most. . . but nothing special. Also they foreclosed some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unpleasant (for me) nudity, but not so much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Nah. The final monologue (s) of the killer made him / her quite incorrect. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A jump or two, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I suppose, yes, but I just didn't fit enough and it's just as obvious as the nose of the killer. / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
