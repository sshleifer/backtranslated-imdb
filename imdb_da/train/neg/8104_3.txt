yes cheap shot I know, but this film is a good example of how a collection of significant ones of depth (political turmoil, love / desire) can be randomly combined into great critical recognition (see also 'American beauty'). kaufman's film team along with free sex scenes tense with often painful dialogue sequences (in one scene I counted three different 'generic European' accents touched by the actors) and state shows can run amok, but fail to tie them together in the coherent meditation customers offered. and in its over three hours, it almost completely shines over franz, the missing fourth in the love triangle, which is at the heart of the plot, thus sacrificing the key mechanism of the novel to show the spectrum of emotions and of power relations achieved in love relationship. It also does not allow to include the token screen time for Tomas' son, which is used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points customers made in the novel. combined with the overwhelming soundtrack, these errors in this movie make three hours unbearably weight in tone yet light in content.
