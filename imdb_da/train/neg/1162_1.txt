I went to watch this movie at our college theater 30 years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson) it's still the most boring movie I've ever seen. It just went over and over again without visible points and so - it's just finished. The lights came up and I looked at everyone looking around in confusion. Did the projectionist miss a coil? I've never wanted to find out. All I can remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the completely mystified audience afterwords. Fortunately, this was only an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
