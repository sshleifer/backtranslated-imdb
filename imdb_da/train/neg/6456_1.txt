Well, what can you say about this disaster? I saw it because it aired on cable. I'm sorry I'm wasting my time, but at least I'm not wasting money. <br /> <br /> Being the cheesiest you can get! Please, you must be very generous so as not to be alarmed by the cheap Halloween costume. Oh yes, there are also screenshots of horrible plays, f / x and dialogues. The confrontation with creation is incredible, you can't get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get from direct to video flicks. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movie look like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, please. The only "positive" thing about this bin is the sexy women.
