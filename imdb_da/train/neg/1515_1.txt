I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the cast of Gere and Danes, and because history's synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the WORST movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never posted online before, but this movie was so horrible that I had to do it. I suppose the problems begin with the script, which was so amateurish, it's incredible. History makes no sense, and the dialogue is so tired, it is nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As for Gere / Danes on the screen matchup, due to the terrible writing, one does not believe in any character for a single minute. I bet Gere would like him to buy back the negative, was such a thing possible. It is a shame to see the talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what you're thinking. How do I really feel?)
