WARNING: THE AUDIT NOTES MILD SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A few years back, I managed to see the first five movies in this franchise and planned to make an overview of the entire Elm St. series. But only two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them to do it ?? I suppose they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I remember, some of the followers ?? Dream Warriors in particular ?? was not as bad as often done, although the original was not classic. Generally, the predictability of the assumption (if people fall asleep, they are murdered in their dreams) does not require narrative excitement. But while I can't remember many of the first five movies, I know they never plumbed the depth of Freddy's Dead. An indication of how bad Freddy the public was at this time can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the death of the character. The fact that the film's conclusion is not even hidden, but in reality is the whole purpose of the film's works to illustrate how idle, fun and cynical this was. <br /> <br /> With the moral dubious idea of ​​having a children's master as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's incomparable laughter interpretation laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of teenage parents was less directed at the signs than at the teenage audience who could ever see this tripe. It's like Englunds crying out "we know this is garbage but you pay to see it, so who is the one laughing?" And I am sure that victims of child abuse would be discouraged to see such an insensitive depiction of their situation. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a pair of "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr ?? has to have resin" and that is it. If this was the only Elm St. movie you had ever seen, you would not know the character at all. Although the character before death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-lift pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie exaggerated, misplaced and not at all fun) irony. <br /> <br /> It's almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer takes over with his gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the movie sinking further into the bog. The script is also absolutely miserable, almost completely without profit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a driver's license where Noel Coward-like Freddy has written "You're f ** ked". When asked for the card, Carlos responds "well, the card says we're f ** ked". Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> What about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing improved to painful levels? So Freddy bothers him by threatening to release a pin ?? a potentially lethal sound as all sounds are magnified. It's strange that Carlos screams at the top of his voice for him, not to lose it, seems to have no effect. "Nice hearing from you, Carlos," says Freddy, hoping that some better lines will come together. It is also worth noting that dream sleep does not occur immediately, so being beaten unknowingly would not give immediate access to Freddy's world. Although part of the story contains a human computer game, and a 3-D final plot logic is not so high on the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teens who throw thrown this time are really the most unpleasant, unlucky group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one to greet Freddy with "close up, man" and a kick in the scallops. And was unnoticed pop music always a part of the ingredients? Freddy's dead. No laughs. No scare. No interest. Not funny. <br /> <br />
