The wife and I saw an example of this movie as they watched another DVD and thought "Jon Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach, it must be better than summer shakes, so I ordered it from the local library." Lawrence Welk "would laugh more than" Mama Boy. "I actually felt sorry for the actors for reading the script in the privacy of their own home and I couldn't imagine what it should have been for them to actually say their lines in front of a camera, maybe, at least maybe the next time they are offered a movie of this kind, they just want to say no!
