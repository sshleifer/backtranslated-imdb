There are lots of comments already written and say exactly how I felt about this movie, so I keep it short. "The Grinch" I thought was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a truly talented physical comedian and a versatile smart actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, gets his laughter by being annoying. I used to like him a lot in his "Waynes World" and "So I Married an Ax Murderer" days - but I've never been fond of Austin Powers and "The Cat In The Hat" is just finished. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated that they have not amused anyone for 50 years! The reason was messy, messy, messy! It's a shame really because the kids were very sympathetic as was "mom". They could probably have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it wasn't for Myers ugly, outrageous handled depiction of the cat. <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers just look at a script? Was there one written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to wing it! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and props were amazing !!! But unfortunately they can't save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr Seuss - The man was a genius! You must not ruin his reputation by adapting his work in such a lazy, messy way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
