This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie has nothing positive about it. Some of you guys really like this movie! I've seen many Dracula movies, and I've seen everyone as I've seen, but when I saw this movie, I told myself, "What the hell is this?" What a silly movie. Now they have Dracula, as he is, because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrays Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty that he hanged himself. It must be your joke. It is the stupidest reason I have ever heard of why Dracula became evil. Who asked for a reason anyway? What a piece of sh ** this film is. Who ever came with this apologetic excuse for a movie must be beaten. Even Dracula is terrible. If you ever saw this movie, you wouldn't even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should that title impress me? Don't waste your time or money on this bin.
