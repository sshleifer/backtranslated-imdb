This is a very poor western mostly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like it was shot in a California trunk instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado Territories and Montana. It dictates everything known about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". Scripture is horrible; There is very little direction and miserable acting. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as her wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage line superintendent. He was feared by his local towns for his hard drinking. When he became drunk, he would start fighting and causing other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To make sure he could never terrorize them again, lynched Jack Slade after ignoring their warning of leaving the city immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can't recommend anyone to watch this movie out to see how Hollywood is hitting the story, even today.
