The original "Cube" is a fantastic B movie rich with paranoia, fleshy characterization and fine over-the-top performances. It's scary, cryptic and cool. And it stands perfectly well, alone, without a stupid successor like "Cube Zero." <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie in the Cube series is partially reproduced (most of the booby traps are unfortunately reused), part aberration. It takes the bold step to explain what the dice are - something that was never revealed in the first movie - but since the explanation is bland, I'd rather keep it a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the community that exist outside the cube, but they never evolve beyond hints of a kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, what little social comment is, feels flat and unfocused. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The action is purely amateur hour, pacing is slow (how much of this movie is made up of two geeks looking at a screen?), And the gore effects as they revolt, fail to convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a "Cube" fan-fic, a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that absolutely didn't need a sequel.
