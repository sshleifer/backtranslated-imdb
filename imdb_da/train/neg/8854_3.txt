We had STARZ free weekend and I switched on the station to see what was on. It was this movie Howling II: The action was horrible, but the eye like that was amazing. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candy. I was very laughed at the few scenes I saw. My friends wonder why I will never go to Horror movies if they saw this movie, they would know why. I would be thrown out to laugh so hard. Just a few trivia notes: Reb Brown, who played Ben White, had played Captain American in a made for television movie Marsha Brown was Mick Jagger's inspiration for the song "Brown Sugar" Mick has really good taste in women.
