Lolita is a rebellion and she will share some small sex stories between sci-fi and fantasy in our broad eyes. Now this Surrender Cinema production is not very good: very bad acting, horrible music and a story without any history and any line. BUT the sex scenes are pretty well done, many lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House of Wax, give us a very good last and very hot strip show. To Lovells fans only.
