Hey, hey. This movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks a lot of time. I remember the day I first saw this on the MST. The sun shone like a good day. Then I saw this product by Rick Sloane, which consisted of horrible plush dolls that cause destruction in the crappy 80s party country. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard, fights with rakes and many more things in this very bad series of pictures. No plot or story is needed. Obviously, no action is needed when the film proves. An army guy and his six scared girl will make you jump off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kick off phone sex will make you say, "He has some nice red shorts". Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart. When you think it's over, wait for the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> Having seen this movie, I recommend a good month to regain senses and health. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick for the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.
