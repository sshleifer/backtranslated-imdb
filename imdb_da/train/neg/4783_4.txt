This is another bad movie that you probably should avoid seeing. The plot can be much "thicker" than it actually is and would be better made as a movie film. <br /> <br /> The action leaves something to be desired, even though you can't quite put your finger on what it is. <br /> <br /> This is one of those you see on sennat TV, maybe in the United States, simply because you can't get to bed. See it if you want, but don't expect too much from it.
