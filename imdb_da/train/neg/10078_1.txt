Boy-girl love affair / sequel with songs, only this time she is punk and he is the straight arrow. Movie buffs out there actually like this movie? It has fans? I must say, the mind rolls ... "Fat 2" is a real lame company that doesn't even have the courage, moxy or pure gal to commemorate its predecessor down in flames (like "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it collapses in slow motion and plays often die. It looks and feels cheap, with a big cast lost in the messy direction and unfocused handling. It was the first time a large audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer, and even though she didn't scare herself, it is worth forgetting. A misfire at the lowest level. No stars from ****
