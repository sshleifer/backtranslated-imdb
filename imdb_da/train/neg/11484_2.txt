Is it just me or is that child very annoying? <br /> <br /> Hideos sister spends most of his time running around for the disobedient little one and so. As for him, I know he is a child n everyone, but his acting ability is about wood as a dead tree. So far I am only halfway through and fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope it gets better at the end, as I can't know what it is all about. Although some suspected cryptic messages in the writers on the wall and a notebook indicate that everything is backwards, ie. However, God, Live is Bad, etc. ... just seems a little obvious at the moment, but no one mentions its obvious meaning (Yet anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I update this post, but if you Read this as well ...... See the above statement.
