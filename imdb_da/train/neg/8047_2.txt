Simply horrible slasher, cast from I VID, what you did last summer type of feed, have beautiful wealthy college students spend spring break in a Florida condo being murdered one by one. A misfire in any category that can be imagined from properly built excitement to the executed death sequences. Nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures that you row to look decimated as quickly as possible. Del Tenney (the curse of the living cross, I eat your skin), of all people, executive producers, co-author and stars as a priest in a crucial role, whose relationship with the killer I believe matters to why he is psychotic. The revelation of the killer is horribly handled and ineffective, probably not surprisingly a soul that sees it. There are many attempts to scare jumping, with a sign jumping out to scare their friend who could not even produce a few cheap tensions because they are then calculated in such a lukewarm manner. Most attacks occur on the screen with bleeding throats (.. or pools) representing the only real display of violence. The long-standing finale, where the killer continues, the actor desperately trying to make his villain as devilish and demented as possible, is embarrassing and unhappy. There is not one positive thing to come from this clich√© and boring exercise with the beautiful caste that makes a little effort to get past their one-dimensional roles. And for pity, at least they could have let us see Joey Lawrence be beheaded or something to resist the misery of sitting through this junkhung for 90 painful minutes. <br /> <br /> Dorie Barton, the heroine final girl, Beth Morgan, who the killer seems to be obsessed with, could not be more vacuum and uninteresting (oh, she was in rehab and taking pills for her nightmare, such an exciting exhibition). Chad Allen, cast against the type as a very scary "friend" for the group (... that happens to disappear from the movie first and puts the idea that he is the first victim), has a hard hill to climb with his role, so he stumbles eventually stumbles, rolling uncontrollably without end in sight. Jeff Conaway, who needs some money, I believe, has the besieged FBI role, whose daughter's murder motivates him to seek the killer and lead him to Florida. $ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$, <br> <br> Jack McGee $$$ $ $$$ $$$ $$$ When you get the answer, you will wonder why you bothered with it anyway.
