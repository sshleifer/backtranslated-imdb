I'm not from America, and I know what 'wife prey' is. When a show came out of that name, I was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a really sucking fool. I was offended by his title name, it has no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (broad cast cast Hallmark channel, and I think they edited / mutated such content to clean it). <br /> <br /> A show that gives a picture of the current American / Western family status, overweight lumpy people, contaminated teenagers and their sucking family walks. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each other's homes and reshuffle each other's family routine with their new own rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or even poorer. At the end, each mother is brought back with their husband and tries to conclude what they did for each family in the last days. It is the sucking part of the program where each competitor fights for their rights. I was eager to see all these instead of seeing some cool adult sex art. I mean who makes this program more than what is called "Wife Swap"; It is better to be called as "Mother Swap". All in all, it disturbs all the great things that the real Wife Swap stands for! <br /> <br /> Wife Switching = Average Sucking Reality Show.
