If you are under 6 or 7, you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she sees it. As an adult I can't stand it !! I'm ready for successors .... when they have a decent story. But it's not close to standard. Forgive me to slate what is a child's movie, but when you have to sit through it almost every day when your kids love it so much, you will understand why. My daughter wanted to watch the movie over and over the same day if we let her down. <br /> <br /> I have given this movie 4 out of 10 solely because it keeps my youngest entertained.
