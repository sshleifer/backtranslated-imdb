It is my opinion that when you decide to recreate a very good movie, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a new point of view. Now 1963 Robert Wise's tale of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and reinstatement. I was left shaking my head and asking why? The action is wood, the story is irreversible, and the whole point seems to be replacing the original jail of the original with so many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was poor; but could not believe it was so bad considering the source material. I was mistaken. Having seen this and told my wife how terrible it was, she said; "Now they have your money!" She's right, don't let them get yours. If there is no profit in making miserable re-makes, they may stop making them or come up with a higher standard that does not offend their audience
