Ok so here is the basic plot. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who has lived quite a long time. The film opens with its birthday, celebrating by drinking a special elixir, which (although the film never mentions) prolongs its life. Well on this occasion, the elixir is lumped by an assistant (Kato if you remember Pink Panther movies) and he orders his minions, then find 6 rare things to make the elixir. This creates a global man hunt where his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing in London to meet with Dr. Fu's nemisis, a retired Scotland Yard Detective Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers trying to stop him assumed to be a witty comic adventure. <br /> <br /> This was apparently Sellers' last full-length feature film he made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Merchants who are such a gifted comedian and have had memorable 'fun' roles in the Panther movies and especially in the movie 'The Party' are something but that in this movie. This movie was absolutely torture to sit through and I couldn't even finish it. He judges completely, and I continued to cringing while looking at Sellers' performance. Having come out of the great work that is "there" a year earlier, how do I mean how can he do it and how was this thing even made ??? As a person mentioned the first 10 .. 15 minutes is ok, but then it is ALL DOWN ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 out of 10.
