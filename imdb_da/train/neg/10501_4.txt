Some say that Steve Irwin's Larrikin antics and gregarious personality are just an act. Watch this movie: It's obvious he can't act. Steve Irwin, dangerman star on the small screen in his * Crocodile Hunter Diaries *, * Croc Files * and the eponymous * Crocodile Hunter * series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?), Rocking his bigger end-combatant to the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * (yup there is a particular tendency for words beginning with 'C') - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * mashed along with a B-Movie. <br /> <br /> On a mission to move a big hook to rescue it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and wife Terri are unaware that the hook is being tracked by American spies ( Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom), to restore a spy to which it has been extinguished. Will it hurt my credibility to say "They're on a Collision Course with Wackiness"? (What credibility? - Ed note.) <br /> <br /> The reason is irrelevant as it is Steves animal magnetics that propels the film. If you find his person trying, the movie is a failure, but if you are a fan of either him (like a businessman, a conservator or a simple ass-klown) or his television shows, more of the same expects a broad-screen budget . <br /> <br /> John Stainton, faithful lie, best companion and helmsman of Crocodile Hunter * oeuvre * (can it be called a straight face?), writes and leads with the same provincial swagger to make Steve a household wildlife . <br /> <br /> The most devastating aspect of this movie is that Steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation marks he speaks) and Terri (Steve's 10-year-old spouse hardest allies and closest friend treat it as it is one of their documentaries, break the fourth wall and speak directly to the camera, while all the other characters behave as if they are in a bad movie (well ??). It wouldn't be so inconsistent if Steve and Terri were kept separate from the rest of the characters ?? but when the bad Americans constantly threaten Steve's life, we must confuse viewers asking ourselves why the indifferent camera crew member does not at least call the police if not trying to poke the bad in the eye with the bombers or running in screams in shrub ?? anything but keep filming randomly with great lighting, sharp sound and seven action angles. Although Terri is unfairly painted as Steve's mildly incompetent sidekick (her play consists of boldly scary line reads and adorns herself in pear-shaped furry jeans - for the last time I don't complain) Steve goes about his business as usual with show-and-tell with creatures, Who intends to kill him, does all his stunts himself, because it is good for him that they are not really stunts, just a day at the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, after the tragic death of September 2006, this madman's coo-coo adventure sees a strange detachment during the case. But for those of us who have never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter * series in constant oscillations) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile graves. The lack of reality of his absence will only be evident to the nearest him. And I really want them the best in following in his oversized footsteps? <br /> <br /> So enjoy this diversion for what it is ?? a semi-baked movie with a full legend. He died doing what he loved ?? interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film when he portrayed him just that. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
