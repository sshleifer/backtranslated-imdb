The movie is pretty confusing and ridiculous. The reason is terrible ... but on the plus side, the play is pretty good, with a few good shouts and rant. Sharon Stone is OK this time ... not even half as good as the original mind. Nor are the murders as bad as the first, which is a shame. It's not the unpredictable mess that everyone says it is. Sexy is pretty graphic at times, while others are clear it's false (they are fully dressed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes of scratches and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The reason twist a couple of times, but the end is horrible. The excitement is always constant with a huge dollop 'Oh my god!' The chase sequences are brilliantly controlled, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise rush movie. Sharon stone is also a bit old for this. The bits where we see her breasts were in the first a treat. This time, they are too terrible to describe. The movies themselves are pretty average, but it's worth going. Mainly because the movie deserves some good buzzer ... with the opening sequence as a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave it. Don't destroy the race. You will be glad you left this stone unchanged.
