- A movie staff shoots a horror movie in an old, apparently damned house, where over the years, seven people have been mysteriously dead. One of the crew finds an old book of magic and it seems that it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes of their movie. It is justified that the bars in the book are better written than the script they use. But when the book is read, the cemetery comes to life suddenly. Now the castrator and crew are exposed to real danger. <br /> <br /> - IMDb shows a maturity of 90 minutes. In the first 60 of these minutes nothing happens. Too much time is spent on the movie in a movie. Should we be afraid of the horror movie they shoot We already know that their movie is not "real". These scary ones just don't work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses. The action is terrible. Most of these "actors" would have difficulty making a primary school game. The result is terrible. It is very similar to a 70s TV series and gives no atmosphere. Talking about atmosphere, except for a moment at the end of the movie, there is no one to talk about. Character logic is anything but non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect signs to behave in a certain way. Here I do not think I remember a scene where a character does not choose the most illogical avenue available to them. And finally, there are the first 60 minutes of the movie, which I have already mentioned. Can you say BORING? <br /> <br /> - I did not rate The House of Seven Corpses somewhat lower due to instances where the film (probably accidentally) actually works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The open title sequence shows the death of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie. And the end scenes on the massive staircase that zombie penetrates the movie crew are somewhat effective (what a ringing endorsement). Overall, these moments are not enough to make this a good movie.
