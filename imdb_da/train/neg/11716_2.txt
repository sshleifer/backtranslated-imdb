Having seen this, I thought of myself who are either too few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> At least it's a horrible movie. Terrible in a way that it is not fun, but makes you grin your teeth and shake. Make you shout "this is wrong" in the movie. Immersion is zero. Today, most of you are probably used to the terrible errors / notifications in movies that have computers hackers, etc. In them. This film is so in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily who plays brilliantly by Eliza Bennett. I hope she gets big and does this ... something at least worth something. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't look at this. There is not even proper action in it. Total waste of time.
