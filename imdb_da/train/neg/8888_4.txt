I rated Basic Instinct 2 highly, but that movie got less than a 4 rating. This movie only got 4 from me, but it has 7.3 from over 600 people. I can't see a reason why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring because it hardly ever leaves these rooms in the big house. And it only has a total of 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours long, which is completely unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The movie tone is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The movie can only be shortened to some sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsia, one is just as boring, the dialogues are equally dull. It also has a high rating! I had to stop looking for the first story to finish. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks passion or excitement.
