I was really looking forward to seeing this because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It jumps as quickly to the main plot as they are attacked by a group of strangers, and Dyer is hit extremely badly while Anderson is raped. They then decide to go for some revenge. That sounds good, doesn't it? Well, it's not. The story becomes dull and sidetracked, and some things become really weird. I don't want to give any details, but things happen that I don't want to see first. I like to give all movies the benefits of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It just didn't work. I give it a 3 out of 10, mostly to the actor.
