This movie is phony incarnate, a straight 11/10 on the phoniness scale. The recording of the accents as well as the density of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. Yanks, though the real Scotland might be as colorful if you ever go there, don't expect much of a chance to "dance" controversies with the locals. You also should not try to hover the local meaning through the otherwise fine tap dancing. <br /> <br /> There are a few infectious song-and-dance scenes, but the plot is far too cheesy and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt if anyone will be stuck in a timewarped Scottish village in the 18th century in boondocks rather than gay New York City. Perhaps it was not so great a victim of the priest that he had left Brigadoon, perhaps he just tried to get out of that dump. <br /> <br /> See the fine alternative reality look at what a Christopher Streed Day parade in Scotland would look like at LSD. Apart from that, I would only recommend it to Hollywood musical completists.
