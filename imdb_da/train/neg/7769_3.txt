A real head scraper of a movie by Bill Rebane, who seemed to get worse in his trade through the eighties. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a distant hotel to compete in a last-person standing competition where the final contestant gets $ 1 million, provided he or she does so far. A number of lama pranks are drawn on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances, namely to be shatfaced in the hotel bar. Most scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts, including an open dance number, a crossover of American Bandstand, encountering geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation, white people could not dance this scene, hammer the last nail into the coffin. Pay attention to the nipple. This continues for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane begins to throw darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene, making this one incoherent mess. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots are in full control until they are not. The hotel is obsessed with a supernatural force until it becomes even props. They are dead until they are not. Even the narrator at the end answers that he does not know what the hell happened. I defy anyone for justifying where Rebane went on this. The actor is a dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day job at the local Stuckey. I give it a few points to the scene where yuppie wide opens the closet and a skeleton is inside the skull humping itself. Let's see Gone With the Wind do it! This Chilling Classics collection really gets me in the way. Path, get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
