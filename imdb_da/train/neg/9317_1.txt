I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said it was so cheap because the disc was scratched to sh * t, but failed to mention that the reason for it was so cheap was that the movie was a bad action that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a hotel room home video. Speaking of home videos, since it has been fair game to release them as movies - I believe that movies used to hire actors and technicians and screenwriters, and so on - no more - just gather your friends and lame ideas together over the weekend lavishly the production with a budget of 8.00 DKK and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then slam it on the shelves, for some bad sap (me) to go home in lonely desperation. But here's the clincher - I jumped fast forward most of the time and threw it to one side, ready for the hammer ... until the next night, while watching a Darren Day horrible 'Hellbreed' (£ ​​1 99 to go home and keep from another Blockbuster). Now this movie made 'Grim Weekend' as The Exorcist, so I turned Grim Weekend back on to catch up on some of the moments recorded on the wonderful IMDb boards that the alleged viewers were fun. Sure enough, when I had come across the misery, the pain and horror of realizing Grim Weekend was a complete cod on the toast I could enjoy, enjoy and even come down to the fun stuff. And there is a lot of it. Check the boards. Then check the girl. Hell, it can even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
