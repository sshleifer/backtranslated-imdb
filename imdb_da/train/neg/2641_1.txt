Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and impossible. It carries no view of a true human story, dead and boring. It is a parody of Hollywood, with trumpet music pieces reminding you of a Denzel Washington movie, wobbly camera images and focus, racist stereotypes, absolute unnecessary and comical shots and movements from famous people in the clothing catalog make up. It is made to meet the many zombies whose significance in life originates from seeing celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and the funky song that comes with it. I want an idiot to see this, save yourself.
