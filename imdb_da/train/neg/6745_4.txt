This is a low-budget "Scream" style movie. "Maddy" is a new employee at an eye-catching unnamed office where she meets and starts a relationship with her colleague "Chris". During a hot tub party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they belong to a "Murder Club" where everyone has killed anyone for kicking. When Maddy loses it and kills someone into reality, he works. <br /> <br /> The movie looks great and there are prerequisites for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly larger stars than cast), but after the credits you roll yourself why you have spent 80 minutes in your life watching it.
