Tobe Hooper may be the greatest fly that the horror genre has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think that to put your name in front of a movie title, you need at least more than one hit movie. I can't really think of any other movie that Hooper has done (on his own, doesn't count Poltergeist) that really influenced the horror genre or movie world. And this movie, Night Terrors, just supports my point. Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least doing a good job with the terrible material he got. He did what he could. What about the film itself? Clean drudge. Unnecessary naked scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written in ours, and really just awful nature, music and movies. Nothing in this movie can be redeemed. Do not waste your time. Overall 1 out of 10. I'm sorry Hooper, his career seems like it was over before it really got going. I hope he is able to pump out at least one good flick so he can make his cult status a little fair. <br /> <br />
