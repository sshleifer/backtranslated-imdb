I saw Phat Beach on cable for a while, and I liked it. The fat guy is the best character since he seems to be a good guy. The rest of the characters are just different stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to see these low budget films taking up a period because they are almost like a documentary for this year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also fun because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have the "local babe" quality, and you can tell the babies in this movie the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was fun to see how the "young" went wildly over what was essentially a much-used, high-quality shank. There were also some cute ones. It's the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of dogs and some real cheeks! I checked some of them on IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if anyone ever managed to make a "Where Are They Now" book on all the cuties that have appeared in the history of the movie and then they never returned. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost all movies who seem to have a lot for them, and yet years later when you watch the movie again on TV, you wonder what ever happened to X? In any case, this movie is blowing, but it has some fun moments.
