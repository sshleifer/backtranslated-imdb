This movie is like real life, which I mean - not much happens in the vacant 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot appears from the often invisible cast (their invisibility is due to the "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers) . <br /> <br /> A great bore. It's not a big surprise that Altman heals this - he's a very variable performer (yes we all loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" someone? Kansas City? Dr T. and Women? Aaargh), but it The fact that raw material is a John Grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will experience through the collection of disgrace from your demanding slumber - really makes this a masterpiece of bad movie. And no, it's not that bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
