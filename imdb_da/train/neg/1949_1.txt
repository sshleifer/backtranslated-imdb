The animation looks like it was finished within 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. I didn't think much about Scooby Doo animated movies (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full-length movies.) But some of them were pretty cool and I Like most people found Scrappy Doo to be annoying, but this series is pure waste. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters, (and I use this expression loosely), I spoke. Mystery Inc. was also a team, and without the whole crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening a box of chocolates to find someone has already eaten the best, and the only thing left is those who do not want to. What's New Scooby Doo was better than this. If you need a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that made the series so long lasting. The whole cast of characters and quality animation. They need to put it back under the rock from which it came.
