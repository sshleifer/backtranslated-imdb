OK, I admit that I watched this movie on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (as I'm a big fan of), but I'm not one of those who automatically gives a MST3K movie a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies they play and some are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I've actually been able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That said, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (It is no wonder that the MST3K authors themselves commented that this was one of the worst. Don't believe me, see their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is a good example of what NOT to do in filmmaking. The dialogue is very poor, the play is worse, the cinematography is pathetic (while perhaps it is the best thing in this movie) is bad. Pacing is the worst part of this movie. A few times in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. While minutes may not sound like a very long time, it may be in a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was supposed to create a mood, but I was just very sorry. It really felt like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "suspension of unbelievers" means "almost falling asleep during a movie" then it has enough of it. But the SCREAMING SHOULD be just as awful, I may not have got anything interested in something that actually happened in the movie, and thus the "suspension of infidels" was actually nonexistent. <br /> One of the worst and probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
