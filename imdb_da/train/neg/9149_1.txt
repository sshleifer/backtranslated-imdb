There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the smallest scrap of talent. No one in it has ever tried to shop before, even extras in the coffee bar seem to have been glued in place. Nothing looks exercised. The film quality is horrible. Most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman framed as an afterthought, swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' when delivering their lines. No tripod and no proper microphone, nor the sound quality is horrible. Even 'Manos' prices better than this, at least they had decent equipment. Which plot is simply lost in the production mess. Stick to home movies, preferably made by a 5 year old child trying the video feature on dad's new camera phone. You will be in a long search to find a movie more inaccurate than this.
