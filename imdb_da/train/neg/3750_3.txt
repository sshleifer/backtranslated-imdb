I finally got a look at this experimental Lynch shortly after waiting so long .... and unfortunately it wasn't worth it! Even for a door-to-door Lynch fan, I found this very boring .... Nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful breaks where nothing happens, long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing ends with the viewer not knowing or caring what the hell was about what happened before and what happened afterwards. <br /> <br /> There was a Mulholland Drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very much Diane and Rita-esque and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to a significant event that happened but cannot be spoken clearly . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's all very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it's very forgettable, and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget that I've ever seen it . Excuse David!
