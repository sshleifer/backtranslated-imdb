This series gets 2 stars only because it puts some of Dickens' Bleak House on film and maybe someone will read the book. Unlike what was probably received, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. She was lumpy and wood. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I interrupt myself and respond to all the people who say, "I haven't read the book so I don't have to take that guy's mind because he bases his evaluations on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is poor in her role due to bad action, whether or not you have read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is an acceptable Jarndyce (although it is too old). The series does not fail because it is unfair to compare it with the book, but because the different plot lines and characters just don't unite to create a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and entertaining entertainment. It's boring and flat. If you want to make a good Bleak House, use 20 hours of movies in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest that manufacturers, etc. Leaves Dickens alone (even a Christmas Carol). Tv kills Dickens genius as manifested in his brilliant plots and unforgettable characters.
