I am an incomprehensible skeptic and agnostic and therefore expected to enjoy this movie. However, after seeing it, I honestly believe that I could have made a better documentary myself. Its arguments seem to have only four fake sources (despite being listed in the credits on IMDb, I didn't see Richard Dawkins anywhere), it edited ugly with ridiculously amateurish computer effects, and it doesn't even make the slightest attempt to think impartial. The story is imbued with all the time with a sneaky, almost youth anti-Christian feeling that destroys any possibility that the film can actually change the minds of others as opposed to just preaching to the chorus (ie me). Although there is an interesting discussion about Jesus' historicity, the film strikes an unbearable snare as it begins to become heavily resident in the Christian school that the director attended as a child, an institution that apparently scared him hard psychologically as it occupied him this day . <br /> <br /> Of course, although TGWWT had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent comment on the very dubious roots of Christianity. There is certainly a lack of skeptical reminded religious documentaries on the market and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to offend our intelligence with this waste, which ultimately seems to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he does not have to submit to an audience for his handling mechanism.
