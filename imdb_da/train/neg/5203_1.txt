I've seen poor movies in my time, but it really takes biscuits! Why oh why has this movie been made? There is just nothing here at all. Please trust me, flip off the button and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... that can take approx. 5 minutes to show on the camera. This is the key issue, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... whatever) allows in no way to be padded for 80 minutes. And so we have to sit for over an hour to see people walking around. That is it! Throughout the first half, absolutely nothing happens, except to see someone go to a store ... and then 3 guys go through a tree. This time maybe it might have been used to developing character ... but no. And then there is absolutely no connection to people on the screen, and so when they start shooting, we couldn't fit less! In fact, I was eventually vouching for baddie so the movie would end! Besides this, the camera work is really terrible! This director / editor / author / producer, Ti West is bad. I hate hitting a guy, but really, his work is pants! These boring shutter ups continuously, and then take long singles after the people as they go - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring, I just wanted to stop the movie and split my wrists! How this man has been brought in to lead the next cabin fever film is beyond me! To be finished, the play is also sad, which applies to the film as a whole. Keep your beauty, stay clear of this pile of total excrement!
