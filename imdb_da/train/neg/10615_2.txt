Strange, where less than 2 hours can work as a lifetime when sitting through such a flat, uninspiring drive. If a story is as personal as this apparently was to Sally Potter, wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance? Her plays were completely detached, and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been burning considering the nature of the dance, were rather awkward and painful to see. Clearly, revealing such a personal story about movies can be daunting, and as such, Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness.
