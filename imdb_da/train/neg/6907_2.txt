No artful writeup here because it doesn't deserve one. Not an art movie. Not even one of the 'hidden' pearls. You know just like the movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie in the center, where they show all the good self and art films. <br /> <br /> Just pack it into the Christmas boxes and throw away quickly.
