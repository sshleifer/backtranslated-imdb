I enjoy quality crapness and this goes up there with some of the finest. CG is out of this world, or at least predicts our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot block in a rat outfit chasing people is ridiculously bad. I enjoyed it very much, but the play is so terribly terrible, and even the compulsory key scene has no bap in it. just a waste of time if I ever saw one. I don't know who wasted more time, I looked at this or the poor saps that were drawn into doing so in the weak hope that this would start their play. I can assure you it won't. But on a brighter tone I managed to cope with 6 degrees by Kevin Bacon from this movie, so I thought it was almost worthwhile to see the 91 minutes of it.
