The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, nothing! The action sequences seem more like a series of random Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up commercials stitched together. Very influenced by Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I don't expect many expectations, but looking at this movie is a terrific experience that makes you wonder "What were these guys thinking ?? !!". The only thing you may remember after seeing it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. The reason I didn't give an assessment of '1' is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood shows me wrong.
