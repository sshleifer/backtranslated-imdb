Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit into the same year's PUBLIC FEMIUM. She will not be remembered for this strange little story of a girl's girl who finds out that her past will always be with her. In some ways, it seems somewhat antique in 1931, almost as if you are looking at the 1928's renowned LIGHTS OF NEW YORK. But don't be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photography is still in big scenes, there is plenty of movement, indicating distraction to the movie players in their setup. But in competition with the fast-paced things that everyone seems to have done at Warner, this attempt to bring the woman's point of view into the genre does not seem like a towbar and Mae Clarke is also not the actress.
