Boy what a dud this mess was. But it only lasts an hour and I only paid a buck for it, so I will live .... unlike the whole cast of this 1933 clunker, there is all the dust now. <br /> <br /> Still, a small village begins to have organs that are drained by their whole blood. The local yokles start talking about vampires of course and a little higher after each body is found. The city's sheriff or constable or whatever he is played by the amazing actor Melvyn Douglas is trying to tell them otherwise. When he mentions the fact that the dead have a large hole on either side of the neck, instead of two holes close together, the locals say it's a huge vampire bat. The constant insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human sinner who does the killing. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn doesn't look worried either. He spends most of his time trying to get into his sweet songs, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix, the city is simpleton, played by Dwight Frye, who already seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did. He continues to play the cities by catching bats and drinking his own blood. Lionel Atwill plays the city's doctor who apparently tries to help the constant solve the crimes. And boy does he stink anyway as an actor. A will is so close to cardboard in this role that he could get. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing .... many big names are such a pile of guano. <br /> <br /> Apart from the horrible mis-title this movie has, the alternative name "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this movie is also boring and plodding and just stupid. <br /> <br /> For me, the high point of the movie looks at Frye, he nails the freaky town weirdo, but apart from him this movie didn't give much. And then, when you find out the cause of the strange deaths and see the special effect that required all this blood, you will really have to be let down. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi did a lot of horrible pictures, but at least he was fun and interesting to see. of this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi, and you get a sense of how miserably bad this mess was. <br /> <br /> If you can't make a good 1930's horror movie, at least put Lugosi in it.
