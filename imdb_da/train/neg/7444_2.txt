Unless you are petrified by Russian people or boars, this movie is a snorkel. In fact, I fell asleep about 40 minutes and had to fight for the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of a lovely Saturday night. Even "Silent Hill" was scary. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was scary. I'm still unclear about what should be scary in this flick. <br /> <br /> Initially, I am very fond of movies using "pidgin Russian" as it did in the opening credits. It's embarrassing for me when I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all cringed. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you too), this movie has already escaped my brain, and I went straight out of it an hour ago. So I have no specific, just scary visuals that go nowhere and a slimming-now-dead hope that something would happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can't believe it got such good reviews here (that's why I saw it) and ended up being so completely devoid of not just Horror or Suspense but Total Entertainment value as well. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 because yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up & did not leave.
