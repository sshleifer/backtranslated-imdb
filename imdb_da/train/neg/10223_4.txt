I remembered the title as well. For me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in the role. And that was Vincent Massy's voice from behind whiskers. Good Flora Robson was good. Her next signature, for me, would be "55 days in Beijing". The same role, but with various lavish dresses. And the same voice. As for Armada, it was a subtitle. I like black and white movies. Was everything done in Elizbethan times in the evening? It was talked and hard to understand, at times. I couldn't tell what was the interest of love. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I don't think Elizabeth would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent to Armada. Apparently it worked for the empire, but not for the script. This could have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts. And I missed daylight!
