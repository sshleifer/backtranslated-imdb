This movie could have been a decent B movie if 3/4 of the movie wasn't so much focused on sex scenes. I mean, he is a sex addict and I am sure there is much more that goes on with sex addicts without having sex on a constant basis. Michael Des Barres did a great job considering what everything he had to do, which wasn't much. At some point one had to laugh at him because his character was so pitiful. Nastasia Kinski was okay in her role as the concerned sex therapist she could have done more herself and I do not suggest that she have sex. The person who stood the most out of me in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and worried wife. There is something about beautiful interior and exterior that strongly appeals to me. She played that role, and when you saw the movie, you start to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict", while not Oscar material or a modern classic for any sense, is quite informative and does a fair job of showing you how one's personal demons can take over and destroy The very things in life you think high about.
