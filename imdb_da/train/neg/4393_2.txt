I didn't like Frosty back and this one. Both films are absurd with badly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been done but frosty returns were worst than this because of the uneven snow white they drew. Frosty winter winterland was great and it was also the original heartwarming drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty; doing, but everything else was poorly written and poorly animated and I hardly got the plot. I watched the DVD cover in the library about 2 or 3 years ago, and the art looked crappy so I didn't pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching, but I played this movie. It was a hassle of bad art figures like the DVD, and it was just awful what happened. I saw it at night and found it boring that I fell asleep on the whole. (Wait, I always do it when I see something while I go to bed). But this movie was totally boring. Overall Rating: Grade -C <br /> <br /> This is like another holiday special bad rip-off in frosty returns and this one. This is the bad 4th sequel as home alone 4 well I thought the movie was ok, but home alone 3 was fantastic. But it is like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate such. My sister didn't see it so much when she came into my room to see 2 and a half of it, she went away like "I hate the animation!" I accept her like the 3rd one Frosty returns. Ordinary horrible!
