Comeback begins to look promising, with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing a killer. The mask itself is also pretty cool and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990s movie "Granny". From then on, the movie is mostly boring. We get some more deaths, which again are good, but there are not enough of them. The reason why the deaths are so good is that they are frenzied and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and would have worked very well if it hadn't been so boring for the most part. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't avoid this unless you're a die-hard collector - there's not enough here to make it an average slasher flick.
