It is the best way I can describe this film that centers on a newlywed couple moving into a house haunted by man's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances. It sounds good and good, but what plays out is one hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning in the beginning of the movie that promises anyone who dies of scaring a free chest. Good confidence in me, no one has ever taken them up with that offer, unless someone out there is afraid of plastic shells, peacocks, strange gardeners and doors are being turned on. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music that sounds like it is played by a sixth degree. And you will find out the horrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking. Someone dies as they run and hit their heads, and the police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end, this is slow (which is really bad considering that the movie is just over an hour), boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person. Apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person.
