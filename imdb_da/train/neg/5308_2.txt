Nothing can prepare you for another miserable bimbo excursion! This time it is brought to you by the inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As far as movie exploitation goes, don't click it! As science fiction, it is commonplace unoriginal! All we see is an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the Earth and show all that is hard to resist! Give me a f --- ing break !!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, why not dust the old SI swimsuit from the ceiling to a change? This would have been much better if it did not put the sleaze factor on very high but it would still not do this well. I would like to highlight another movie called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, similar to the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why the top-notch 1-person "femme fatal" action movie doesn't translate well in America. Sorry, fellas!
