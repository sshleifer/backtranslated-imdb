!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think a story involving Archie Gray Owl - An Englishman who makes up a red Indian - would have a massive amount of humor involved. In fact, I say the only way to treat a movie like this, where a remarkable man breaks the happy public is to treat it like a comedy. But Richard Attenborough commits himself to a crime by making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he also made an extremely grim movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role, and the romantic sub-plot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the same tree Annie Gaupeau) lacks any on-screen chemistry. But to be fair to them, they did not throw off the manuscript that fails to portray Archie as the naughty chappy he is fooling everyone into thinking he is a native American. The producers and the scriptwriter have made the biggest mistake of having the film center about the archive's interpretation that Archie is Englishman - that's why I wrote "Possible spoiler", it's actually not revealed until late in the movie that the title character is English, but it's obvious that anyone who saw this movie knew that in advance it is absolutely no surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is great and that it has a deep ecological message that is not a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major environmental activist in the 20th century to tell the truth. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (And possibly TO TOWERS, if you want to classify it as a green message), there has actually not been a large organic film. In fact, most environmental-conscious films suck, and that includes GRAY OWL, a movie that surprisingly had a serious problem finding a distributor
