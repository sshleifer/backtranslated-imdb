How this movie could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original film is truly remarkable. An incredibly thin and unengaging plot, ankle-deep characterization / motivation and a really horrible soundtrack (replacing the high-noise tensions, replacing the original musical references of the original to digitized crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original that are just " plastered on "over the cracks ... horrible. In a world where grimless, brain-dead American remakes by The Italian Job (a tear emerges), Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have faked our screens recently, one takes the proverb Biscuits, pristine nonsense How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder ... Dirty.
