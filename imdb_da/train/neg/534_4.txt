This crap is like watching paint dry. I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it. <br /> <br /> There is simply no meaning to this movie. If it was never made, no one would notice or care. It is hyped up because of all the big names in it, but if "no one is" in, no one would give this movie any love. Anyway, I was at the point where halfway through the movie I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Hurry up and die already!" This is like "Joy Luck Club" without any of the friggin's joy. It's "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a big-name cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic ... oh, until finally it is over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they will all be nominated for Oscar's ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for movies and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk .
