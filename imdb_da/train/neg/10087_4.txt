This is probably the first entry in the "Detective Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat" detective series; In subsequent O'Leary films, he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by famous character actors) gather in an old house (on a rainy nite of course!) to speak to a wealthy relative who enters the coma. <br /> <br /> While waiting for him to recover, all kinds of mysterious assaults occur, including a couple of murders. <br /> An eerie movie; worth seeing!
