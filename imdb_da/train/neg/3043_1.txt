This film should be a "noisy" tale of Santa Claus and his "magical and mysterious" wonders. But instead, it seems like being absolutely scary. Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as terrible are 1) The way Santa looks. - Have you ever seen a more horrible looking Santa Claus? and 2) Satan's "evil rep." Pitch is simply unusual dances just diseases to see. Only watch this movie if it seems to be the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can't believe it's a children's movie.
