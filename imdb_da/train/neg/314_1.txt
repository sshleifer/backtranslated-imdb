I downloaded this movie for $ 5 dollars at a discount bookstore, Adam Sandler is a great actor and I figured it would be a good movie, yes it wasn't. There was absolutely no story whatsoever, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Word" every other word he said, curse doesn't usually disturb me, but it was over the top. And even worse than the lack of history were the parts where Sandler would just start talking into the camera in random parts of the movie. It reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn around and look at the screen and ask questions. And last of all, when they randomly inserted bikini shots of girls in random times in the movie. In my opinion, don't buy this movie, it's a waste of money
