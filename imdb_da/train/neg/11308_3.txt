<br /> <br /> Get your brew skies out and enjoy this flawed action. Speakman's significant kempo skills (nice spin kick, decent with sticks - poor sofa!) Is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad plays. The reason is not half bad; just done pretty badly. But if you see this movie for something other than martial arts, you are missing the boat completely. And for a movie that was to take place in Koreatown, too few Korean players (just extra).
