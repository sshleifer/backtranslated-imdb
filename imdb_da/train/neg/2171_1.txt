This movie has probably one of the strangest themes in history - right up there with Ed Woods passionate defense of cross-dressing in "Glen or Glenda?". The topic: play bridge. Park Avenue set plays it; Bohemians play it. The Russians - who speak very questionable "Russian" and have most convincing accents when they speak English - play it at the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in the bridge - even in spite of the great cast - is not likely to be very interested in this bizarre movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - as Luke is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishist script.
