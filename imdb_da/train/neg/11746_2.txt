Now this movie has probably had a lot of hype; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to the gushing reviews on CBC Radio. A refreshing, crazy, hilarious indie film apparently. I had been looking forward to it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I just say this? It sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. At best, it was mildly fun and at worst coma inducing. An amerterish script that is poorly directed and sharply edited to a ramshackle root. <br /> <br /> And what was the music 500db higher than the rest of the soundtrack? It was about the only really strange thing about it. <br /> <br /> To see a real fun, bizarre movie with foreigners, try Repoman. There is no comparison!
