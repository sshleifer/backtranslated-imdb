Wow. The only people who review this positively are carpenters apologists. I know many of them. The boys want to watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid and snap out a movie and proclaim it a horror masterpiece. This "movie" is completely crap. It looks and sounds like a porn (good gentleman, the soundtrack is terrible ...), and has subparent pornography, which is shocking, for normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when this was done. Most likely, "Prayers, prayers, prayers ..." until someone fed him and rolled him up in a blanket for the day ... They say nothing about the abortion at all, as they could have had a very interesting central theme (how religious Anti-abortionists feel when it is the devil's baby?) But instead, they chose to have Ron Perlman and his terribly acted children kill a lot of people and get the horrible thrown doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. Not a single person from this episode or what do you have to get away unharmed. It's just awful. Like, Plan 9 from Outerspace horrible. Like, good god, please, if someone knocks it off before I am horrible. Try to see this and The Thing the same day and your mind will implode.
