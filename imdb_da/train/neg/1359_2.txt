A good casting is terribly wasted in this slower than molasses and random greeting comedy. Peter Ustinov is trying hard here to bring something to life, but the result is a dour borer who misses all the right beats that could have made it sail. Regardless of the positive comments here, this movie is horrible. Poorly corrected. Badly edited. Poorly acted. Poorly written You have to sit through a hundred movies to get across such a bad one. The confused and eerie laggard plot relates to Ustinov, who leads his way into an American insurance company to hack their computer and subdue millions of pounds. How he does it goes beyond secrecy and credibility (he just learns his computer skills overnight by reading some brochures, and hoodwink computer expert Robert Morley enters South America and steals his identity). side plot, Ustinov romances brother Maggie Smith, who just happens to be his secretary by chance after he gets an apartment in her building. She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart, who doesn't go anywhere, while Ustinov goes about grafting bit by bit and trying to step one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he forges Smith and they fly to Brazil, which has been finalized by almost all British capers comedies since (Nuns on the run? A Fish Called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The surprising twist of an end is more ridiculous than anything that came before. In the end, I thought I really had to be out of my rocker to keep out of the drop like this. Even a como by Cesar Romero did not help. One of the most unfunny, disadvantaged "comedies" I've ever seen, and certainly the worst caper. Do not waste your time. If you love this, you should see better movies.
