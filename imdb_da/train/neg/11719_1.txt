With the words of Charles Dance character in this movie, "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Full of things that just don't happen in the real world (since when were British police officers armed with small arms in shoulder hollows?). Full of bugs (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. And the management / editing is horrible - wobbly handheld camera shots that don't add anything to the movie except for a vague sense of seasickness; confusing cuts; no structure. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipe's character is completely unsympathetic - why should we take care of what is happening to him? Direct to video? Direct to the trash bin!
