Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth watered. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable. 30 minutes in, I had trouble keeping awake. 60 minutes in and I hit the shooting button and fell asleep. Finished it looks the next morning. Shouldn't have bothered. What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Day of Life ..." Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue awful. Continuity is non-existent. Camera work could have been done with a handheld Super 8 and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
