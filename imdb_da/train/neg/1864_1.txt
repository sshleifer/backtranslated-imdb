I must not be a critic, but here is what I think of this movie. Well just looking at the movie at cinemax and above all I just have to say how much I hate the story I mean, come on, what makes a snowman scare over small children, second, it's pretty funny, but I know since the film is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical voice is bomb !!! Good attempt, and the successor will suck twice as much.
