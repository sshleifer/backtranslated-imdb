Yes he is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to dress up his actors and publicly show their interests. Pintilie is the naked "emperor" - so far ... <br /> It is great time for someone to tell the truth. This cheat is a voyeur, an abruptly locked in an old man's body. His abundance of naked scenes has no artistic legitimacy at all. It is 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by letting the actors strip in buff and look at their will. And if he does this in front of the audience, he can probably get a tough one on the road! Did you know that on the set "Niki Ardelean" he used to scare the poor Coca Bloss by telling her: "Oh, Coca, how will I get you!" She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became indescribably shameful - to his petty satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences, so many people are still so stupid to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! Will anyone have any decency to postpone the truth of it all?
