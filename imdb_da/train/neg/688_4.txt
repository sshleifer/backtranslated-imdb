I always wanted Fred MacMurray and even though her career was tragically cut short? I think Carole Lombard is fun to see. Join these two great and attractive stars together, add top supporting players such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour, and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, join them with renowned director Mitchell Leisen and get a mediocre movie experience. <Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet sweet" during his visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks in love. Skid is a great trumpet, so he begins a musical career that is predictably meteoric in both the rise and fall. During his ascent to the musical star, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start again after he hit the bottom. Oh yes it is the true Hollywood happy ending that no one comes early. Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow that it's hard to see at times. The early stages of Panama are so bad that they seem to go on forever, and later an alcoholic ski wanders infinitely in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the tired script and the S-L-O-W direction just don't give them a chance. Even the final scene where Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, just doesn't ring right. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen once to see some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard. But I guarantee to see it seem to take about 48 hours.
