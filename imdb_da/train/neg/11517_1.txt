I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unfriendly <br /> <br /> to it (at least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Poor <br /> <br /> acted, a whitish script, cack handed direction ... Watch this movie was <br /> <br /> like seeing a car crash - you want to look away, but you continue to stare <br /> <br /> because you want to see how messy it is going to get. Well, the car is <br /> <br /> destroyed and there are no survivors. On the plus side, the kinematics were <br /> <br /> lovely, made me go on holiday if I only wanted to clean myself from <br /> <br /> this unholy
