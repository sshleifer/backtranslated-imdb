This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing and managing) 2) this is so bad I have to leave a review and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It looks like it was shot with my flip video. I must also believe my friend who told me to see this has a vendetta against me. I noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; Must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. Hopefully the authors and the director leave the business. not even talented enough to make advertising !!!!!
