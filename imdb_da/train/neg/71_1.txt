This movie was so incredibly bad I could hardly believe I saw it. The management, editing, production and scripting all happened as if they had been made by high school students who do not know much about film. There was no narrative that made any sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (like an early between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as suggested at the beginning) come completely out of place and are not created as if they would have been more elegant and effectively made movies. The signs are unfortunately underdeveloped, which makes it difficult for us to have any kind of connection with them. The play is surprisingly not quite bad, but the horrible writing cancels the relatively convincing notions. The film plays as a particularly bad T.V. western / epic, and unfortunately, the fascinating (true) story reduces as it tries to tell. I've read a lot of reviews that defend the movie as important to the Australians because of the subject. It's all good, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon, DO NOT MOVIE GOOD. No one says that the subject is not good, only the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historic event for Americans, but that doesn't mean I have to defend the film and say it was good because it was still bad. A failure around, although Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
