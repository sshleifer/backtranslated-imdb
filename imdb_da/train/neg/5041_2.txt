Ye Lou's movie Little butterfly throws a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the Japanese forces in war-torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after an adventure meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Parisian reviewer. The film replaces a chronic, semi-historical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to worry about the signs or their causes. The sudden time shift does not help, as it seems completely unjustified and meaningless. Normally, I don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the barking shaking camera recording and the generally bad movie making methods really make it a tough movie to watch and be interested in. a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic filmography ", but I don't think it helps the movie. The background for the movie is one of the most potent events of the 20th century, and I do not believe that you can do it fairly by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. The excessively melodramatic moments do not add to its durability. <br /> <br /> The actors are all appropriate melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited tone, as she uses the whole movie to do what she thinks does best in all her films, spreads and looks generally annoyed. However, she adds at least some variation in this role to chainsmoking and engages in the worst love competition since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in Terminator. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disappointing movie, especially looks like how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2.10
