I am very open to foreign films and seem to believe that I understand what they are trying to achieve, even if some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this movie was boring. I often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or period that really didn't make sense. Now that I've seen a movie as such, I no longer think of these lines. There are tones about society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. And when I look at South Park it actually moves me to feel a feeling. The closest I felt to a feeling during this movie was the gab I experienced after the first five minutes. I judge the typical movie seven or more because I love most movies. I gave this movie one.
