It is, of course, illegal. Pedophiles ask for things like this. How did they get away with making such a movie? This movie is summed up in one word, SICK. Where do people come from and look at these kinds of movies. When I saw the movie, I actually didn't think they would allow this kid who might say 12 if it actually sleeps with this woman. Sorry if this is a spoiler for you, but I wouldn't have rateed this. Where are these people's beauty gone? Perhaps the film's decision makers are pedophiles? Our society today is filled with all kinds of sexual predators that pray for children, but filmmakers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked. This is a child here and someone asks something about this? What's wrong with this picture?
