I didn't want to say this totally sucked, but if it wasn't for Netflix, I wouldn't even get this in my house. Steve Martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat. He's just not fun. He is another in a large number of SNL rejects who can only find work that is accruing to the next SNL movie. The birth bus with Elmer Fudd lisp is about as fun as it is original. Amy Poehler simply goes through the same movements that she would have for a 7 minute SNL crap that is as fun as SNL lately. The only thing that goes for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes. The end was predictable as soon as you heard that her character could not get pregnant. The topic could have opened up to other comic experiments, but it seems simple to simmer together, not really entertaining or creating laughs.
