This film shows us nothing original. Every idea or (action) scene can be found in many previously released films. Fabulous Nick is quite common here. Patton herself will be quiet and evil or not good. Sir. Duvall is ok but has a very small portion. It also does Angelina, so how can we determine her newly recognized stardom? Overall, there are too many characters, so nobody and nothing are particularly detailed. This makes the movie easy to forget. Too bad, don't you think?
