As a mother of 2 young children who is or should I say, has grown up with Scooby's many reincarnations, I feel well prepared to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If you are family we hadn't seen any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby get a clue we could have had it as a lightweight, no special Saturday morning cartoon. But it's essentially the problem it's in the current format, so easy it won't have long life for the "old" Scooby and gang. I'm sure it can succeed with a quick monetary return, but I'm sure the long-term purchase of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. My 6-year-old son, who saw the new version, was really unhappy and said, without any kind of thing, that it looked really bad animated and why was it not like the last series (Where are you). Scrappy Doo was an irregularity but still infinitely better than this. Let's hope Get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers.
