"I'm curious: yellow" is a ragged and pretentious steaming pile. It does not matter what one's political views are, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, it is not true. I've seen R-rated movies with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere because they don't exist. The same goes for these crappy cable shows: schlongs turns in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And the pretentious indie films like The Brown Bunny, where we are treated at the site of Vincent Gallo's broken Johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or suggesting) "double standard" in key issues, the mental blunt should take into account an inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on the display when the actresses appear naked and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you will generally not see female genitalia in an American movie in something that is not pornography or explicitly erotic. This alleged double standard is less of a double standard than a rather depressing ability to express culturally with the inside of women's organs.
