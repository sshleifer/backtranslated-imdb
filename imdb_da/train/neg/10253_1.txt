Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I try to see all his work. He has been known to store movies with a single hand with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This movie suffers from a low budget and its production values ​​are disruptive. Please ... for Christopher's love .... avoid this movie!
