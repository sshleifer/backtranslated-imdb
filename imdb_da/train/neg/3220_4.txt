I absolutely hate it when a movie completely falls apart near the end after you've already invested an hour in it. And that's what happened to this movie. I was fascinated by his actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his source story. I haven't gone to read this story, but I can't imagine it ending up as this movie ends. Fortunately, I didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (especially wife was so perfect) .but milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! Now it was fun. I have not researched its production, but it played as the director lost his marble or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Before this time, a story and character developed a series of nice plot points and there was not too much time wasted. but ooh the last 1/2 hour - if it wasn't the scariest, most worthless insult I've ever witnessed, I don't know what's going on. I just hate it when one's faith is as corrupt as such; It feels like an act of violence.
