Savage Island (2003) is a lame film. It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid trades. Not only that history and script were miserable. I don't know why this movie was made. I've seen many flicks in my time and those I really hate are movies that make me angry. This made my blood boil. The situation was scared at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short one. Really because these backwood "idjits" would not have been in the picture. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cover on D.V.D. I am an avid aftermath of poor cinema. But this movie is almost unmatched. I don't care if movies are shot at D.V. But if you want to do that, make the movie fun, no tired retread of superior horror movies (sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental shop, you pass by. <br /> <br /> Movies that make you really angry get an automatic 1.
