Usually I tend to like low budget ggon movies, but Darkman III is so horrible that I don't feel disdain for it. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show and a very shoddy one on it. The sets are sparse, the light flat, the score and the effects are uneven, and the camera is movie school 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are one-dimensional, and the actors sleep asleep. Most of the casts seem to be making soft core porn ..... Actually, the only reward I got from this mess was spotting the outrageous squint towards Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager ) without her Klingon bumpy head makeup on. Her skin color is about two shades lighter than it is in Voyager; either she was bleached for this role or answered Voyager. Very strange either.
