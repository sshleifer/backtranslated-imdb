A really scary movie. Feels like it was made in the early 90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gay people are good, normal, mainstream aspiring people. Retrograde for being offensive, the LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred pathway to salvation for sad, lonely, sexiest homosexuals. Wow! There you can just see? The supporting characters are caricatures of homosexual stereotypes (the bright buffaloes, the bitter, lonely queen, subjects of interest, etc.) and the protagonists are milquetoast, the middle class, middlebrow clones, of little interest. <br /> <br /> As for the romantic and ideological struggles of the most important couple, there is little to say: we have seen everything before and done much better.
