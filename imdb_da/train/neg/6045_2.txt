This is an interesting idea that has gone bad. The hidden meanings in art left as traces of a serial killer sound exciting, but the performance in "Anamorph" is terribly slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the movie too boring. The death traces are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that links them is boring. Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as an investigator, but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the border. Several supportive character actors are wasted, including Peter Stormare as the art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a medical examiner, and especially Deborah Harry, who is on the back of the DVD case, but only has a few lines spoken through a cracked door. Not recommended. - NOTE
