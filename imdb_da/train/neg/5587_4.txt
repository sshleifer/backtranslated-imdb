In addition to his "Tarzan" series, the lush Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, but apart from the popular "At Earth's Core" few of them have been filmed. One exception is the novel "The Lad and the Lion" which was screened as "The Lion Man" (1936), a persuasive, static, old hat, slow and rather boring movie, despite being filmed on true desert places. In fact, "movie" is the wrong word. The story does not move, but continues at the snail's pace in a steep series of jerks. For example, at least five characters are given deeper opening scenes and then disappear only. Even more frustrating for the avid movie fan, are the characters that give an impression of varieties (such as the lass that puts Hall with grape wine), but are adopted by non-credited players! The credited thespians are generally worse than the unknown ones. One exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues the young master. Admittedly, most of the cast are sitting with the horrible King James dialogue to be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is the tongue-in-cheek, a stratagem that doesn't seem to have taken place in a single movie's roster of no-talent players. Maybe director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. Still, it is sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to trade lines with Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (her suitor). Sir. Although Hall lives his lines with marginally more conviction than Mr Carlyle, it is no recommendation.
