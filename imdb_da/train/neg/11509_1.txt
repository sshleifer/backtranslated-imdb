I do not know what some of you smoke, but I suppose it is powerful. <br /> <br /> To ring swept away, it would be an insult to the very concept of horror. The action is horrible, and I do not choose Madonna here, we all know she is useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her suffering is contagious. My back literally hurts to cut so much on badly delivered lines. Editing is so sloppy, it begs description. Photography and composition (as in this era, the competence should be GIVEN for any movie with a budget) is amazingly unfortunate, even the lighting is horrid and unnatural appearance. These are BASIC elements in film making, if you can't get them right, look for another work style. It is as constructed as a Class 3 production by Snow White, except not far from so well made or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written with stunning images - You can practically taste the sea salt and feel the wind blown sand in your hair. The sexual excitement feels real and immediate ... those of you who found Guy Ritchie's version regrettable should see it is truly one of the world's cinema landmarks. <br /> <br /> Those of you who thought remake is a kind of masterpiece should have your minds examined.
