I do not believe all the praise for this movie. Toys and movies were a ripoff of Sleuth. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier, and Reeves wants him to be Caine. Caine even had the nerve to make a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one who did the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This film was made during a time of Caines career as it was obvious that he needed to pay gambling debt. He would do anything for the money. He wanted to star in such award-winning films as this and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be praising this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better than being remembered for this miserable movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in $ 5.97 bin at Walmart. Along with gems like "The Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
