After reading the book, I loved the story. In the film I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies are different, but there were two different stories, only the names and part of the book's history remained. Read the book and you get a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are very interesting and make you interested in them. The location was actually consistent with the book's descriptions. Some characters are not included. Televisions have microwaved so many good books and stories, this is a perfect example of that. Input from the author does not always ensure a good movie, but it can sometimes help.
