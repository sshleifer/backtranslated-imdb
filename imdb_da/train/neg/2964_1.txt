Scared a lot - because it's so incredibly bad - sorry people, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's low budget, yet: the actors act like playing in a soap , the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time i have seen such odd pictures was on a garbage bin at a teen video festival ten years ago. I greatly appreciate the fact that people gather and shoot film, but at least a certain amount of quality must be achieved. But at least one good thing: The first three minutes of the film were quietly interesting and so okay - and the score was really worth listening to. The DVD cover promised a lot, but it is by far the best thing this movie has to offer ...
