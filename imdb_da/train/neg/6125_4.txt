This is the best movie the Derek couple has ever made, and if you think this is a recommendation, then you haven't seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: It's just as badly acted as their other endeavors, we can see Bo's disrobe or audition for wet T-shirt competitions quite often, the story is just ridiculously idiotic, and the movie takes itself too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But it has some things going for it. Bo looks good, the production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) are pretty good, and this greatly improves its rental value. In a strange way, it is actually quite fun, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
