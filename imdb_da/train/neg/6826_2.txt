It's been a long time since I last saw a movie so badly. The action is very average, the story is terribly boring, and I'm lost to words with the execution. It was completely unoriginal. Oh, and it's just as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood is a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV show - where in the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% let's see it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career renewal, then I think this may never happen on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and clearly should be an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the others. I'm sorry, but if you ever consider seeing this - I strongly recommend that you turn to something less traumatic, because it is not only a total loss of time, but also a faint example of what a poor cinema looks like.
