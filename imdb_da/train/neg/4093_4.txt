The reason and signs are ridiculous and barely qualify as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is that everything is dark, out of focus and blurred. That Fulci filled the whole movie with fog doesn't help. On the other hand, whole things are quite bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite entertaining, one of the protagonists says he has no friends, but he locks on the new guy in a minute's screen and has quite a few women on the side. Though he does, he shows his antisocial tendencies by randomly placing an arrow in some poor b ***** d who just think of his own business! Images of blood or gore float more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn't really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth renting if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for swords and wizards or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone who is sucked into a pit 2 meters from your head and screams for help?
