The saddest part of this is that these are 87 minutes, I never come back. I knew this was horrible from the go, with the guy dressed as a lunatic Indian chief on top of the roof. (See if they could get away with it in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is really in baseball right now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Although he seemed to enjoy some of it, I had to ring when I heard all the unpleasant foul language. Bad, bad movie. This was a terrible ripoff of Bad News Bears. Totally shameless and completely predictable. I don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well, but it certainly wasn't.
