I was so disgusted with this movie, I felt obliged to warn others. This movie has no history, plot or suggestion of purpose. The movie starts after the standard "let's be scary" movie intro, which now all movie guards have become accustomed to. So we can completely ignore the beginning. We are soon introduced to the greatest actress and from this point it becomes clear to everyone that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better looking static. (Unless you've seen white noise - EEK), it's a shame and everyone has to return to the travel pantomime where they came. That said, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely aware. Their bad notions only contribute to the disaster. Sinful violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another unwanted "eccentric" writer who probably considers himself an artist, has resulted in a movie that will test your patience. It was not until my colleague turned me around and said, "We've seen this for 45 minutes." I realized that this film is so thin and tasteful as a cup of tea without a tea bag. It was clear that something was missing and unfortunately it was not the audience. Instead of suggesting what the movie is missing, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (Surprise Surprise), Victims, Bad Monster-guy-Things, Approx. 2 minutes of history stretching over hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit sour in some of the scenes, but expect to see her face ripped off for the rest of the movie!
