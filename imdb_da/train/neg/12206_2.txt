I can't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of "A Season in Hell" who was recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, taking pictures of the US prisoners who believed To be still in terrible camps and to return without engaging the enemy. <br /> <br /> Better chance. What if he didn't do more than sneak in, take pictures and sneak out? Who would come to watch the movie? <br /> <br /> It's actually a party of Stallone's muscles. In preparation for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and dented throughout.) There are ritual bands on black leather, ugly weapons and even ugly knives. The black weapons are cleaned, fitted with high flaps and almost as oiled as Stallone's muscles. Bow is tested, and yes it has enough pounds to run a bolt through the enemy forehead. The knife is sharpened with slender snicks. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of Washington's suits, cynical politicians you can bet on were never in a fist fight in grammar school. No gut, do you know? Just sit with your feet on the desk and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The movie does what it stands to do, but what needs to be done is meretric. It deliberately collects the myth that was popular in the mid-1980s that there were countless many MIAs who were quietly kept in miserable camps by the North Viet. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free Our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? It was never quite justified, but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force - in a country that has absolutely no resource other than work. Or perhaps for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world. As a prisoner, Rambo is treated in a medieval way in northern Vietnamese. Dipped to the neck of the swine clip and then pulled it out by his wrist, his muscles still on the screen. Then, not satisfied with subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer - "Vee haff ways to make you remember." A high-tech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pork dump. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to operate without a hitch until "this country loves us as much as we love it" to educate another myth that veterinarians returning from Vietnam was uniformly spit over and cursed, and therefore we assume we have chosen so many for the congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. The last three lost presidential candidates were among the despised groups. At least Rambos speechless driving left room opens to a successor who arrived nearby. <br /> <br /> The action films with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others became soured by wisecracks, but Rambo is humorous. It marches dully through the imaginary ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
