Take your basic Frankenstein flick, inject some reanimator (but not the good parts) and you have Dr. Hackenstein. It was clearly inspired by the above mentioned films, but it never materializes as something special alone. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife so the whole movie takes place during one night as he tries to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut off body parts from some women who have been stranded and randomly decide to stay at his place at night. I can't really say that the play is bad, nor the control. Everything here is just too standard. What little attempt is there on humor that actually works (check out the scene when Hackenstein stays hidden behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very sad if she saw him squeezed a woman and a needle), but it is hardly enough to recommend this movie. The music is decent, the blood is decent, and the throw looks good. And for half the time I was even entertained by this movie. But I never felt that this was anything more than a time-consuming one. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
