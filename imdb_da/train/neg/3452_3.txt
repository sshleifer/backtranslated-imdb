I chose to watch the film at the latest Dubai Film Festival because it was selected for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious competition department. I was surprised that Cannes could be so marked for judging the quality. <br /> <br /> The movie, some reviewers, has noticed not too much of a shot - but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your young son ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain cup to prove loyalty. There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copolla's "Godfather" who seem to return here in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, but the quality of the two is so distinctly different from chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for violence junkies .. there is no big cinema here. At best, it can be considered better than the usual Run Run Shaw production value production.
