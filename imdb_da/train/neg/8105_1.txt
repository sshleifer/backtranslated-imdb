Hard, yes, but I call them as I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most horrible, boring movies I've ever forced me to see. <br /> <br /> Yes, the cinematography is nice. The Czech options are truly amazing. The political background is alluring, but unlike similar historically set stories (eg, Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this policy failed to make politics relevant to history or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this movie manages to make just "erotic" scenes plodding and slow. I'm too romantic, but this movie was so boring, I began to hope the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I would read the book, the story would have made a little more sense. But life is too short to spend more time on this.
