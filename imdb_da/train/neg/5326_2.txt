"Smithereens" is the kind of worthless flick that just hangs out among the cable channels that occupy space as a cheesy dime novel in the public library. A worthless sad and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman, the film is full of bad acting, poor sound, poor camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the movie. Many better movies never make it to the market, and why junk flicks like this one never seem to go away is one of life's great mysteries. (D)
