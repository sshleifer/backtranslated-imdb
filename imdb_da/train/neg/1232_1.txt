It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this "movie". No wonder she doesn't have other credits for her name to write or correct. She made a serious professional mistake by choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. The basic thing wrong with this movie in addition to the ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the obvious and complete lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** When she leaves the mall, she is approached by four bullies as she surrounds her. Tell me which woman would aggressively see a potential attacker while he was surrounded and offended them orally? I do not mean after an attack had already started, because of course, it is quite normal for someone to fight back. But she pushed that guy and escalated up to the next level. No woman would do it unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) trust to know that backup is very close and it is relatively safe from damage, or 3) the attackers are so young and weak to see that she is Pretty sure she can take them. None of that was the case in this situation, so she appeared just as a person who asked to be raped or curled. And by the way, when the security guard approached, just as he came within sight of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't she immediately run towards him for help or screaming? <br /> <br /> ** As she drives off when the security guard is shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of the city and crashes. She had a good three-minute lead on the pursuers, instead of just running out in the diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out of her Red Toolbox and begins to tear under her hood. I understand she was trying to repair her car, but she should have driven. <br /> <br /> (I didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because I cheat people who do it in their reviews, but it just happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so incredible stupid to comment on it). Why should she have a high Red Toolbox that she is trying to sneak away in the dark? When she gets caught, one of the jokers requires her to open the toolbox. First she resists, then it opens in the end. And take a wrench out. This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect, I have to break it down, it's one of the stupid scenes in the whole movie. When she is asked to open the box, she first opposes herself as if it were her plan that one way or another should cause it to open itself to anger after she had not opened it in the same way as someone in a action movie could have a device that an enemy requires the person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and when it completely refuses to open it, the enemy takes hold of that device, only to have the device deliver it automatically chemical / shoot him in the face he unconscious, which was the hero's plan all the time. It feels like what they were trying to do with Kim Basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and sends one of the carpets and somehow walks away from him and the other three gays. <br /> ** Throughout the rest of the movie it's basically what you see this suburban house wife sneaking around in the forest as she wears her Red Toolbox and takes out various tools that used as a weapon to kill her ATTACKERS. <br /> <br /> ** When she ran away, how did she end up moving back to where the fines were? I think it was the scene where they had the radio that played high in tribute to the dead guy. She shot them somehow when I thought she was away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole premise is so weak, because the whole reason she is being chased in the first place is because, from the perspective of thugs, she witnessed a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the fines himself said, they might just have left the city and return to the city they drove off, none, but she had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate. Though these options would not work to their advantage, how does hell breed and chase down someone to kill those who improve your chances of getting away with the original murder?
