I fired this movie. The original Phantasm had such a wonderful mood and mystery. Like many 70's horror flicks, it looked and felt like a bit creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this lovely attention to mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just awful. It slowly explains all the strange happenings in the previous films, which reduces rather than propagates their power. It shamelessly breaks down the imaging from the first Phantasm as a cheap restoration of the original. There are so many flying areas in this movie that they seem more like domestic pests than threatening mortals. Hundreds hang from the ceiling as Christmas balls sway in the draft. Didn't anyone - the master, the DP, the editor, the director - notice or care that they looked so crooked? Even worse, Phantasm III presents a corny, unfunny joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first movie. The original Phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to create countless cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: several refer to the movie's "flying balls" haha, I have, bullets. Maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they are on us.
