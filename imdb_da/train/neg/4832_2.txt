I was thrilled to see how a little-watched 2008 movie had somehow won Oscar for the best of 2009 and went to The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I got for the two hours invested was the bleak confirmation that this movie had won prizes exclusively for the screens. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weakest things you will ever see. When it is not yet to be another Bourne Identity tribute with gloomy, annoying "shaky cam" images, it shows all the characteristics of a second installment of daytime papers with regard to lenses. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is careful, the characterization is about as well-developed as rejected the Beetle Bailey cartoon ideas and the dialogue - in cases where the film is about to be "minimalist" and without apparent reason doing one or two soldiers on the right chatterboxes - are some of the worst ever registered. In fairness, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to hide how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has the feeling that it is intended as a kind of "mockumentary" that they were bitterly intoxicated with humor and thus re-edited as best they could to transmit it as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours on this movie, the two hours you will never come back, and two hours wasted that you will regret the rest of your life.
