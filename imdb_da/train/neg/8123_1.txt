(spoilers) Wow, this is a bad one. I took a double time when I saw an old Star Trek episode the other day - this was where everyone gets infected by that roomy man and then walks a little nuts - and there was Stewart Moss, also the unlikely 'hero' of It Live at night! He played the first crew member infected, who dies of terminal depression. All I could think was that he had seen his own movie too many times, that was what caused the depression. This movie is full of really unlikely people. There is no redeeming character in the movie, not one. It's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck's transformation into a bat (or what he really turned into) because you just don't like him. And you don't like his sharp, bony wife, or the unpleasant sleazy Sgt. Ward or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest time or energy into this movie? Where there is no empathy with the signs, there is no need to care about it. Not to mention the horrible filmography that made it look like they had filmed the movie through urine and the five centipede effects, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. Not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but down there at the bottom of the row, for sure.
