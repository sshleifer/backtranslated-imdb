I thought the movie was ok but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true picture of their life. I was so anticipating to see that his mother was a real Jamaican, that it runs me crazy. Just watching the movie's beginnings told me that the movie was not correct. Which I completely lost interest just a few seconds from the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a biography of Mark Anthony and having Arnold play that part. I don't know what the author thought was missing a valuable piece of the movie, which I am sure his mother played a major role in his life. I would say the movie was OK besides the great Fla !!!!!!
