I'm from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was far away as far as making it look like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of a scene! Texas doesn't have mountains. I think it happens when a movie to be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The centers are also very bad. They should have gotten Texas actors to play the parts. There are many sought-after actors from Texas out in Hollywood. The movie is really sad because it's a true story. I ask that the killer is found and convicted. The one good thing is the bc of her death, we now have the Amber Alert to help find missing children soon after they are abducted.
