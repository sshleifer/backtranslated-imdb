I didn't think this movie was a bad script, bad acting, except Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, stupid man, and unfair divorce options. If you've never seen this movie before you don't even disturb it, it's not worth it at all. The only good thing about it was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a solid and wise defense lawyer who has won many cases and even got guild killers away. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just a distress. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Nice girl hello. Yes, she's a real peach, not. She is also no day on the beach either.
