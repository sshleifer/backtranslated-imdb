I had to give this movie a 1 because it's so bad, but don't mind thinking I didn't enjoy watching because I laugh and laugh and I even had a few questions. So half the time I was laughing, half of the time I said "what the hell is going on?" or "why would anyone do this?" et cetera. I have most enjoyed the terrible fog effects, the 80's style nude scene / battle / dialogue / nude scene, and the way the warrior's sword claps in the wind as they ride their horses. And there are some crappy model effects (they shouldn't be real trees, are they?) And I still don't understand the guy they find in the cave, what the hell is he? One of my friends told me about these movies, and I thought I'd give them a try and I liked the movie as people like Ed Wood. I have no real enjoyment of what the movie was supposed to be, I look at it in my own fun way. So don't let it distract you if you really thought it was an action movie, that is, I just liked it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than the Evil Dead, so it can actually make you think like you're wasting your life by seeing it (which came into my mind a few times). I think the best thing for most would be to have a few drinks, have some friends around and laugh at this movie. Maybe it's a little hard, but I don't think so, rent it and you will see. Yo.
