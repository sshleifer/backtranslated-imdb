Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictitious statement on Bettie Page's life to go along with her own problems with men. As typical of all her work, any major male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling or twisted. To add to her fiction, she designs ideas and issues that are not true, according to Bettie Page itself. Bettie did not leave biz because she believed it was morally wrong or had religious problems (although she was born again later in life, through the influence of her 3rd husband - a minister). She left it because she was in her late 30's, she was performing in no place and she felt she lost her appearance. Hints of violence and rape have been unqualified and rejected in Betty's own words, and the director's attempt to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been the victim of men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all of her shots (not handed over to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager, who made many famous Bettie footage, also made many "naughty" shots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest for her life and the people in it.
