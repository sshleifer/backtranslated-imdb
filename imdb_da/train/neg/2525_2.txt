This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than church." Maybe I don't understand well enough and I thought it started well, but after (SPOILERS START) Hermann Braun was sent to prison and Maria started working / sleeping with her boss, it just started to pull and I struggled to stay The wave again symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (SPOILERS END). In the end, I fail to see why others think it's so big when I found it very boring. By the way, I didn't look at this movie by my own will, as I was obliged to watch it for a movie class.
