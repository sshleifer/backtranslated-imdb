This movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared ... as in, "was it so stupid as a revolver?" I was also in the Toronto International Film Festival audience last night, where a room full of over 2,000 people went into a creepy silence after being completely dumbstruck by 2 hours of pure nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been great if he had only one purpose. Within the first 10 minutes he has received a suggestion from Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Sopran's fame) which makes no sense! Then there is some shot, and then Ray Liotta is wearing embarrassing bikini panties, then there's some animation, Ray Liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, teeth gnashing, art house will be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that provoked grin at every show. .What I'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they are wiser than the average bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks he's incarnated Yogi Bear. The story lines may have been gone nowhere but the position was out of sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is whether Madonna herself was in it.
