Okay, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was big or even good is either misleading or knows the director, author and producers and is trying to increase the buzz on this movie. I saw the movie because one of my friends was working on it and it was terrible. I am an actress and have worked in the industry for some time on big movies and even independent, and this movie bored me to tears. The reason I'm so tough is that this movie was clearly another view of "Of Mice and Men" and they had to sue because it's such a terrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creative bankruptcy ... for someone to take a classic book and movie "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new spin, insect me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialogue and the direction were amateurish and the writing was gloomy. I think if you have to spin a new spin on an existing story, make sure it is as good or better than the original that the new spin is justified. Couldn't like this movie at all.
