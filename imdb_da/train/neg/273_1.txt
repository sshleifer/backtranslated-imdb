The sign of a classic movie is that it ages as a fine red wine. This movie is not the Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us at night in sit-coms and the dialogue is style and sermon. But let's look at the film's outdated theme. <br/> <br /> With the review of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so-called reality story "Julia" from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most obnoxious of a host of Western-based Soviet apologists, it is obvious that her theme in the drama and film was to touch America into action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists who just had proven their military superiority in Spain. As a reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American game and movie, as Lillian went to his grave an American abominable communist. This film chronicles the well-known silly stupidity of the intellectual elites who made up the American left then, just as now the proxy to the left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore bought into the conspiracy theories and again provided help and comfort to those who would destroy America .
