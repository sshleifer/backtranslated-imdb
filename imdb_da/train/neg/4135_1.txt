This movie was so bad I had to speed up most to get to the good bits. Hah what good bits? The only bit worth it was the end (those who watched the movie will know what I mean). I was expecting much of this movie as an underworld that meets the dead dawn and meets Freddy vs Jason, but what I got was this crap. The story was forgettable, the cast was badly used, and what the director was thinking when he did this. This could have been good, but I turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. OK so what if there was a good bit of T and A, I was after gore and I was bitterly disappointed. Don't expect a movie that is good, but if you want a bad cheesy horror, look at it all and see how a horror movie shouldn't be done.
