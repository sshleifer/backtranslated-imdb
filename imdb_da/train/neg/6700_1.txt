Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmental movement? To a budding young socialist participation in the circus must seem as frightening as entering into a real circus. Although such people usually outsource their brains to Hollywood for these important issues, Hollywood's teachings can often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of enviro mentalism. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of winging your finger in the face of someone without losing your brand smirk. You will learn to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments for fear. You learn to stop any human activity that doesn't interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon. In addition to learning to lie with a straight face, you also learn how to shove off accusations that deflect your way, no matter how much a hypocrite you are. You can use as much energy as Al Gore yet while you have people who treat you like you were Amish. <br /> <br /> The second season was even more useful as we could visit other Hollywood gods, sacred be your names, and review - ie. judge - their lifestyle. NOTE: This is the only time it is appropriate for an enviro-fascist to judge another because it allows the victim to buy up on all expensive and trendy eco-mirrors to turn their finger into the faces of others. <br /> <br /> What does Ed have in store for us in season three? Maybe he teaches us how to be judgmental while we sleep!
