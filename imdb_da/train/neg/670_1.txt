Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho-killer trying to kill her on her prom night. And by killing her family, friends and her enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I begin to tell you, you've been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialogue "oh my God" and talk about gasping things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing you are tired of is the United States, which surrounds Asian, Japanese and Chinese films. It's pretty much summed up Prom night, but I'm still not done with the review. The only reason to see Prom Night is to crush a laugh at the killings. If not, don't look prom night. You never see the killers, one only hears screams and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way, death repeats as 24/7. So not only are they scary but it is uncomfortable. When I met, I think I was ready to throw. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'oh my darling. That's our prom. I understand it's fun, but seriously it's too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /> <br /> If I were to put Prom Night on the worst movie list in 2008 without seeing the other movies, I would also be the first. I'm not going to be surprised if it is released on DVD for cheap and fast. Don't seriously spend your money or the time for boring action, cheap scares and a 'Night to die for' when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS if I could give the movie zero stars I wanted).
