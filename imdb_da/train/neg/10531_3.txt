This is a kind of genre thing, which means you either as the 1950s musicals or you don't. If you do, you will love this. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dancing talents Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so on, but the songs of the 50s, slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all shut me down. <br /> <br /> This movie is a case-in point. The first song was okay, but the next three didn't do anything for me. Then the story didn't have much appeal either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she stares in that I liked, including this one, where the good two-shoe English teacher she portrays uses half the movie threatening to leave Siam. (I, as she had!). <br /> <br /> I separate myself from similar and dislike, but there is no denial of this Rogers and Hammerstein production has many appeal to many people, especially those who liked "The Sound Of Music" a decade later . There are similarities in the R&H musicians. So if you liked the Julie Andrews girl, you should also like this. <br /> <br /> This is a lavish production with yes, a capital "L." These are the kind of big-producing musicals that you rarely saw for that generation. You also get the baptized singers, unlike today, where the actress can't really sing, so Marnie Nixon will save Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady. "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and is the stereotypical traditional, the friendly filmmakers always portray in a negative way. He is not "progressive" as the left wing as it says, but the education teacher (Kerr, as "Anna Leonowens") puts him straight. Today's secular progressives place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! But Yul is good in this role and even uses some comedies along with his more bark-end-bite character. He is rightly the big star in this movie. Brynner had magnetism. Even in "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the only cowboy to fascinate the audience. <br /> In summary, it's a great movie for its day, and millions of people enjoyed it. I'll leave it by that.
