Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among the players that I am always interested in seeing despite reviews. I've always found Mrs Ryan to be a charming and wild actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" largely because of this movie. First of all, Meg Ryan does not play a sympathetic character, she plays a weak willpower who starts to gnaw at your nerves shortly after the opening credit and does not give up to several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less sympathetic. So even though you usually like these two actors, I recommend giving this movie a pass.
