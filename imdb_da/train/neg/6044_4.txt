A well puts the entrance into the serial killer's genre, which unfortunately gets knocked down in its own pretentiousness to be truly satisfying. Willem Dafoe is great as a NYC detective trying to track what seems to be a copycat using the same renaissance art-related killing techniques used in a series of murders he resolved years earlier. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear so that the two cases are easily linked. Clea Duval is a friend of a former victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of art dealer / mentor to Dafoe ... it's a bit difficult to take, although of course, Stormers are never boring. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Quickly look at Deborah Harry as Dafoe's less than forthcoming neighbor.
