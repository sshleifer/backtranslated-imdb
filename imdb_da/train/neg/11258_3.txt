I have said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, but it still won't give you anything. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a good eye for the 30s art deco (which I love) and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and such could be the wave of the future in film making. However, it is obvious that the director became so interested in the digital reproduction of his film, he forgot to film many scenes that would have tremendously helped this surprisingly diluted plot of movies. (SPOILER) To cry aloud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK, they have one, but he has been dead for 20 years at the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point of having a villain. As far as action goes, let's see Sky Captain (Law) shooting down a robot, two or three of the fluttering airplanes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down !!!) and a couple robots, however, mostly spend their time throwing and getting others to fight for his battles for him. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is wasted in this movie (the reviewer commenting on her and the law's lack of chemistry is so real) and I for one got a little sick to see repeated shots on top of her camera shows that she only has two shots left, both of which she subsequently wastes in the movie, an unusual, quite funny, even though I saw it from 70 years away. No one except Law and Paltrow has any significant time on the screen and that is the movie's real mistake. An audience does not identify with robots, they need a hero to rotate and a visible, despicable villain to hate. Without it, plus a good engaging story, every CG in the world won't help.
