I'm a big fan of the old westerns, and don't think Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie that carries almost all of the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter became good guy. fallen but skilled woman, confused urban people who have to turn to the warrior for salvation, etc. I cannot help but notice the first name of the author and the young "actor" playing Granger's son. Any nepotism there? I have seen better plays in high school. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I reached the 1000 words yet?
