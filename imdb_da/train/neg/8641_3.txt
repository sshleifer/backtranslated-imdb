Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br/> <br /> This mediocre 'B' mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as a director. Surely he could have watched another Red Skelton movie or two on his schedule! Anyway, Grand Central Murder is a shameless rip-off of The Thin Man movie minus the whites, charms and chemistry of the leaders. We are treated to a paper-thin plot that can hardly support its 73 minutes, bad actors and tired gags. Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Charger, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a PI and she is his wife and sleuthing partner. They engage in "humorous" scales with each other. See? It's quite different already. Heflin is the only one here to talk about bigger and better things, even though he is really close to being a shake in this. Virginia Gray was in another thin man, but again, let me emphasize, THIS MOVIE IS NO AS THIS, NO MR. And just as we begin to think that this movie is definitely not like another movie (says THE THIN MAN) we actually like, Sam Levene turns up as the main detective who is weak and must have Van Heflin subtly lead him all the important leads. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quickly, the "murder" is that of bitchy schemas Mida King who likes to act on rich men until she finds one even richer. She is played by Patricia Dane, who is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There is a wide variety of crazy suspects, all with their own motivation to have Mida dead. There is the type of society, the hard-talking ladies, thug, ex-laws and a shady theater impresario (Tom Conway, here sat with the unlikely character name "Frankie Ciro"). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, jittery type, something I think he might have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiotic policeman who, in a running gag who won't stop, can't stop thinking about the piece he's been waiting for him when this case is wrapped up (that's right, Millard Mitchell, the swordman). Finally, all the suspects in a completely groundbreaking narrative method, as we have never seen before, have gathered in one place where they tell their stories (like flashbacks) to the detective that Rocky takes mental notes to eventually guilty person forced to dramatically showing a confession. <br /> <br /> At the top of the actual picture is a dud, I naively thought about going in that there might be a few placement pictures of the actual 1942 era Grand Central, but unfortunately no. There is only a very short shot at the start. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So to sum up, a little bit of formula, but Heflin was okay. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out of 4
