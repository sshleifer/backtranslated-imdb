Have not seen children movies for some years, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (Never saw "Bad News Bears", although in the 70's I worked for the guys who arranged funding for the movie "Warriors", "Man Who Would Be King" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" among others.) Now I can like to see old or small movies and find people who have gone into great careers even though they are in a smaller movie than early. Only a few minutes in this movie I couldn't take more and jumped to the final credit to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things - at least looking at his appearance would create interest as the plot and play did not work. Look, I ate Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electric gaff. He had already made two or three of his early shocks, but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped out in this picture. More surprisingly, Fred J. Lincoln was in the cast credits as "Aesop", a crooked sign in the movie. F. J. Lincoln, from the 70s to a few years ago, appeared in and produced adult films. He was associated with the adult spoof "The Ozporns" and precisely that title is more fun than any "Tigers" attempt of humor combined. Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a children's movie is an indication of how the people who make this movie should have slept by the wheel.
