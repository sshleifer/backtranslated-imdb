Weaker entrance into the Bulldog Drummond series with John Howard in the role. Usual fun scales and antics, but not very plot. Barrymore gets something to do as an inspector, swap aprons to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenny on a wild goose hunt (mostly in circles, perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to save poor Phyllis, being held captive by humans, who will lure Drummond to his death. Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's baptism. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fishermen to interfere with The Angler's Rest, but a little of it rises stupidly.
