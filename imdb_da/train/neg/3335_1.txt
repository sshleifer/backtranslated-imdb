This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the party, and it is a positive proof that a five-minute fable is not a full-length movie. Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor is made to look so stupid, it's hard to see him. As the sweet tailor, Robert Morse doesn't have an ounce of charm. Not even his rude nephew (Jason Carter) "The Songs" is terrible and only slow, what is of the plot down. The direction is practically non-existent and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is beautiful as the Emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been called for some reason, a fate shared by many of the smaller players. And the film creeps at a snail's pace. Hans Christian Andersen must have turned somersaults in his grave, as this appeared. To be honest, at least in this movie story, it is not surprising that it went directly to video oblivion.
