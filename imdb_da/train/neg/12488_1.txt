0.5 / 10. This film certainly has nothing good about it. The action is among the worst I have ever seen, what is truly amazing is that everyone is terrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly obvious, the score is awful, I would not say that the movie was edited, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase. It combines serial schemes, voodoo and tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. It is not at all scary, the special effects are hopelessly paralyzed. ridiculously bad all the way through. Scripture was terribly bad. The cinematography is really inexpensive, and very grainy sometimes, and the camera work is terrible. Again, what really makes the movie is how bad all the actors are. Cheap.
