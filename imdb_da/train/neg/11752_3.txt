I like animated shows. I enjoy the Nick ticket pretty much, including Hey, Arnold. But moving a TV show to the Big Screen is not easy, and it just doesn't feel big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and it just didn't move well. Judging by the construction of the children we had with us did not score well with them either.
