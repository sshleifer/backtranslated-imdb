The film opens on Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten running blood in his waiting mouth, from which he holds it, approx. two meters above him. It was so provocative, and I thought, "Here we go! A good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then it died. It was literally the only scene that caught any part of the imagination. It was slow, incessant drive then. I was very disappointed when my previous experience with Sands' plays was quite entertaining. But this attempt was of course misdirected, and the manuscript left much to be desired. Even Julian Sand's questionable performance couldn't begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie. <br /> <br /> It ranks 1.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
