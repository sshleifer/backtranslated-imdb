Yes, I am sure it could really be a nation. . . if four of them all stood on the four corners of the world and the other two cloned a few billion times. Man, I'm really glad I watched this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of the George Romero movies, and I'm pretty sure if he saw this movie, he'd throw up while laughing too much. I mean, what was with the raccoon girls posing like zombies and walking around like Charlie's Devils? It also helped that the music composer chose the silly fashion show music, as the zombies went up to their murderer, especially the part where they enter the warehouse, which constitutes as a furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / whatever room it was with. the background and the living woman argued about the closed furniture store. I couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent showed some more nations didn't help either. Oh yes, what can I expect from a movie where they throw into a random battle situation without good reason in a warehouse where they apparently send ships with air around the world. So for all those who worship the Mystery Science Theater 3000, or if you can just hold on bad C movies (C for Craptastic), then this is the movie for you. . . or not.
