An illegal immigrant resists the social support system that causes serious consequences for many. Well filmed and acted, even if the story is a bit forced, but the slow pacing really puts the end. The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively communicated. The little person who is lost in the big community is something that we can all relate to, but I cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie.
