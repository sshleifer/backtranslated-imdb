Earlier today I came into an argument as to why so many people complain about modern films, where I came across a curious statement: "The character development of newer films is just not as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the movie or movie in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven Hollywood wastes such as War Of The Worlds, but in case of over-the-top, uninteresting attempts to social commentaries and a desperate struggle to Put "art" back in the cinema, it's movie like Dog Days that is due. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or pointless I find them (from good, long as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I have considered painful to sit through a lazy Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I close this movie away from 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I should actually have. I was not interested in any of the characters at all and found nothing significant beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about society's dregs, this film falls too easily to self-giving, thin and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Permitted, I have seen many disruptive films on the same subject, but there are so many better films out there about depressing, pathetic people (Happiness, Rubber, Children, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters with great emotional depth and personality. Dog days did not have more than an eighth degree deviation for society and chose to ignore any true intelligence about how people actually are and instead choose to be a boring, terrible and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art. This is not a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation in society's dregs, it is just boring and nothing worth worrying about.
