It is one of those dramas that is so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the manuscript is quite fierce, really shaking, lighting purely accusing, the only thing that lets it down from a true so bad it is good is that the sound design is only pretty bad; It adds no tension to the story, even though it tries hard, but at least does not destroy any speaker. There are continuity issues with seasons of out door shots throughout. And finally, but not least, the action is appalling. For a professional production, it has the very feel of a university's media project, you have to apologize for the excuse for anyone who had to put their names to this.
