The idea was amazing, the actors were incredible, the story could have been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I couldn't really get into this movie. I couldn't feel the signs, there were many cliffhangers, and the movie just ended very strange. Was it a happy end? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? Again I do not know. You let the theater feel dissatisfied. The movie had so much to give, but couldn't. Just because you can edit doesn't mean you have to, don't you? I don't really recommend this movie because you just can't say you left the movie feeling like it was finished. You just get confused. Believe me, you will thank me if you do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
