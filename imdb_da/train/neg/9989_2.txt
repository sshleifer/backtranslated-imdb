I had the misfortune to see this rubbish on Sky Cinema Max in a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just junk. This is even worse: it is one of the stupid pieces of crap I've ever seen in my life. Horror movies? Yes, there are terrible things in this: the play, the script and the special effects - Gosh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to get a flick for 90 minutes. In fact, it would have been a cartoon movie I would have given it a 5. Don't even think about renting this unless you want to mock the producers. Voice: 2 out of 10 - did not vote for one because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
