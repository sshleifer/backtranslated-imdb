Man, even Plan 9 From outer space is better than this movie. This flick does not have enough plot for half an hour, but they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in the exaggerated battle scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are much better than this enchanting one that would be better left unmade.
