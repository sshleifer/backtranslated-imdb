This show is just annoying !!! I'm sorry the actors have to try to be fun (especially Bob Saget) and the laughs are trying to cover the sad jokes and the "Awwww" track is coming up in the most unnecessary times. The over-dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also this show is cliché city. If you were to look up the word cliché, it would read "Full House". Each story line has a "life lesson" to be learned at the end. A juicy speech does everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden recognition of the goodness of the GASP too badly, it couldn't be possible in real life. I don't know how anyone could see this show without feeling badly about the behavior of the characters or the slat track. I find myself yelling on the TV and saying, "IT'S NOT FUN / SAD / CUTE" If life was really that way, the world would fall apart.
