Whoo-boy, it was definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen all summer. Granted, it was on Sci Fi, and I don't see much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a razor thin plot and two-dimensional characters to the maximum. The characters were stereotypical and overdone, the plot and setting were incredible, the vampires were less scary, more fun, gore was unnecessary, special effects were lower right terrible, and the end? Now the only thing was unpredictable at the end, when suddenly tomboy becomes lesbian and starts doing it with the woman's vampire, which by the way is not really so hot considering that it occurs for about. three seconds when you are closer to "What the hell?" so "man, it's hot." If this is ever expressed in reruns, God forbids not to see it.
