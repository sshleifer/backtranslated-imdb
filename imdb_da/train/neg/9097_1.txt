Who has actually created this piece of shit this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's such a waste of time and money. I hate how they create low budget successors with D-Lister actors and a story similar to the first. I found this movie in copenhagen sitting right next to the Wild Things 2 and Death To Supermodels for $ 2.99, what a fool I should actually think this could be good instead, I looked in disgust as malforming stereotypes torn off the story and the script from the first. <br /> <br /> Who thought this straight-to-video production was actually a half-decent movie you should be on crackd or something because I think what most of the people have seen this movie, thinking what is a lot of CRAP !!!!
