I was not at all a fan of the 2005 Gore Party hit "Hostel" and most of these lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - but Live Feed has managed to keep me a little entertained for about the first 30 minutes. Started with lots of sex and cunning settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese organized crime fight and a 7-foot leather disguised butcher ... What put me off the movie was the tough 'hero' with pistols and grudge rescuing The day ... I would at best call this movie mediocre, as a performance that mainly involves nasty young people slaughtered in a seedy porn theater, doubling as a shadow for the mafia, attracts me. If only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, then my judgment would be very different. Unfortunately, most of the horror scenes are gathered together in a scene where the rest of the movie ends as a revenge scenario. So basically it's just a low budget "Hostel" rip-off with the redeeming use of free sex, almost constant in the first half of the movie ... Overall, I would say don't bother with this.
