I enjoyed the former Ittenbach movie I had seen, "Burning Moon". But while that movie was pretty gloomy and uncomfortable, "Premutos" seems to play it mostly for laughs. Although it is admirable how Ittenbach made this movie without money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worth seeing this), I found myself constantly not to speed up the next gore scene. Well, that's good and if that's all you want, go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: There is an immense amount of lama comedy and boring history exhibition. Many compare this to Peter Jackson's film, especially "Braindead". But look at what Jackson did on a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach lacks a thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and abundant effects and to get the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
