The cover of the box of this movie has Kyle Minogue's name on it, but she has the same fate that Drew Barrymore did in "Scream." It is the first thing that makes this movie lame; They are trying to market a movie with someone in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must have this movie feature young hip college kids who are unaware that there is a killer going around. To top it all, Molly Ringwald from the 80s teenage movie is the fame star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money to make a crazy film in Australia, so she won't be ridiculed in the states. Somehow, this silly movie is a stupid horror movie that was never finished because this stupid creature kills everyone in it. In the whole movie we have to guess who is the killer. Long story short, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or does she? <br /> <br /> This step is simply bad, rent it if you want to torture yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you look at it. Do not spread the horror.
