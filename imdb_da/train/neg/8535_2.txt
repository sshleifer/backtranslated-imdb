As I said, the book was pretty good and it could have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead. What kind of accent was it to be anyway? It sounded the same as her terrible Russian accent in another movie I've seen her in. Every time she opened her mouth, I screamed. It took 3 attempts before I could see the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the beach scenes. They added a much-needed brightness to watch Melissa Gilbert's depressing depiction. I think they could have used San Francisco views more to their advantage though. It looked like night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I can't remember the sign in the book being so depressing. <br /> <br /> Keep Melissa Gilbert out of future movies that require an accent!
