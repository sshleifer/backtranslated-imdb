The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid performing. The first major departure I had was the way Pacino attempted to portray a Georgia accent; at times it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. Dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot. Support support made an extremely perfunctory job of keeping the film interesting, and within an hour I still didn't see any signs of a solid plot. The story in general is a real bore, and I had to relax my face a few times to keep me awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will certainly drill you too ... avoid at all costs.
