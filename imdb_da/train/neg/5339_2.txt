OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets, and I want to go and see most things, now the multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old "flea pit" single screen cinemas and I'm the healthy side of 40 ). In England, this film was released as "Liar", it is a dog. It's a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photography and only sets.
