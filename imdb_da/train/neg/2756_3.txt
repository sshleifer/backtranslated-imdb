I wouldn't believe in them at first, but I think that's what people are talking about when they say the South Korean cinema has eaten and maybe even goes downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") in 2006 - actually managed to make a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre - successive Korean blockbusters have become increasingly generic, even though their budgets (mainly used on special effects) has become increasingly amazing. Will South Korean filmmakers really destroy all the audiences and investor goodwill built up by their industry since the 1999 break-out movie "Shiri / Swiri" by making a whole host of budget-budget films like mainland China? <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can understand to make this movie is to tell investors to fund the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean / East Asian styled dragon, I have seen to date for the final scenes. Now, if they had introduced this dragon at the beginning and gave it more personality and purpose as in 1996 "Dragonheart", the movie might have gotten some more redeeming qualities apart from having lots of digitally animated dragons. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? Has no one learned that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use because they just killed a big international interest in Korean draw legends with the way they filmed this. In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how the Koreans felt about having their folk music "Arirang" played at the end. As a creative feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10, whose special effects or action sequences would have been worth it, but I have seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just minor dragons).
