I understand the jokes quite well, they are just not good. The show is terrible. I understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. The only cool character ever on the show was one oboe in one episode, but then I see the second episode of that episode and the show is terrible. It's not fun, not fun! I don't want people to say "Only smart people get it" because if they are so clever why do they judge people they don't even know and say they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "heaven is red" but never looks outside. But still this is definitely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are awful, I mean you can understand them, they are just awful, her controversy is very paralyzed, her jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really stupid and usually consists of really bad plays. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment.
