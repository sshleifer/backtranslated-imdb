How can there be so many corrupt police without anyone slipping up? With enough police to run a mini-war involving such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone wrote to a weekly coupon, overheard someone who said "thank you" to a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> You will never get your 90ish minutes back. Life is too expensive to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the big named actors who made the mistake of making this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, you feel free to rent this movie. He has a very big part in it, so fans like to see him. <br /> <br /> But I think most of his fans are young girls who can be turned off by the violence in this movie.
