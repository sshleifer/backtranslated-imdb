Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the author (also one of the stars?) He fictionalized his own screws and added incredible fantasies of drugs and murders to make it "hot". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts, it is badly acted upon, stereotypically and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been made before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: Look at Showtime, which provided synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway through before I realized that no one was an undercover fight. Even the other stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened.
