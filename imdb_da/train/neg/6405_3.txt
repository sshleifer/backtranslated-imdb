No real plot for this one, just a series of short sketches that perform some very old jokes. I chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin. But even in just 73 minutes, it is worn out, it is welcome too long and becomes obsolete and boring (with some nudity sprinkled here and there to keep you awake). Still as bad as this movie is (and it's pretty unheard of), it's a comical gem compared to just about anything by Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Date film, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans) Also, the song is sadly crazy in a sad way. Eye Candy: 11 pairs of breasts, 3 bushes, 3 donkeys <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> Code Red DVD Extra: Original trailer for this movie; and trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
