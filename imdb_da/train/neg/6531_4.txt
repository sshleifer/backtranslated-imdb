First of all, let me say that the user's comments left me with tears in my eyes from laughing. One comment that bad SF movies are good comedies is right on the mark. The MST3000 made it live by it. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the feverish dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader from 1959, you have the handle of this sucker. All the elements are there: pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often hilarious infantile. The young youth's attitude towards gender, with the "gigolo" captain (good call on one of the boys!) Eyes the pants "scientist" with hair so red, it is strange that it does not turn off the fire alarms. The ridiculous view of Mars as a planet, so the alien that everything shines red, however, a monster has a mouse play, and blob alien has an eye that rotates like a child's toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!), Sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his jet gun. And of course it is just that the alien = dangerous evil. If these people had met E.T, they would have burned him in two seconds flat! "OW" actually! <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong. I rated this movie low. Still, it is never boring (except when the researcher is trying to explain everything - only to make it all sound more ridiculous) and you have to admit that in your little kid's core it makes you jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Okay, don't admit it. I think you were never 10.
