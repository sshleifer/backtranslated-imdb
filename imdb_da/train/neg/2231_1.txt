All I can say after seeing Snitch'd is please, stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you have no understanding of what you are making movies about. If you insist on filming gangsters, I urge you to do research. It's funny to watch movies with absurd gangbangers who even sound more absurd when speaking. <br /> <br /> I laughed that part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and continues to kick their belly in kung fu fashion. This movie was tough as a post-school special. Who had the idea of ​​having hatred saying where a particular gangbang was from? I suppose real gangbanges do not wear hats claiming to be gangs. It would be foolish considering new laws that add the length to a prison period if a person is gang related. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made.
