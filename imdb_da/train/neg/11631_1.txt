Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of human and humanity's evil. Most importantly and destructively, it changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot stress how utterly repulsive, disillusioned and angry I am at the careless, incredible ignorance of Hollywood, seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those similar to it are bound to cause controversy in the form of footage between movie gangs and critics; Most sure to be echoed by the regular press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the low-lying bastards who committed the most barbaric acts of error and relentless cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry at this movie. How dare the disrespectful memories of the lost families? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save them trapped in the doomed towers on the fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time exploit a national tragedy in the fog of a sadness and tired post 911 world?!?!?! How ... dare they? <br /> <br /> For those who have the gallows to think about seeing this morally appalling travesty, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself if you are a healthy and moral person. Think back to that day, ask yourself if this movie is a disgrace and dishonesty to the lost lives of that day. Think back to the day the families of their loved ones are affected. Think back to the day of the lost lives on these two planes. Think back to the additional carnage it caused after the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of life lost in 911 by not watching this movie at all.
