This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamond's theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel" and explain how Europeans have dominated much of the globe. <br /> <br /> The version I saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond, looking at birds through the binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond fails to use a bow and arrow properly, Professor Jared Diamond is firing a mouthpiece badly. Would this documentary be supposed to make a hero out of "Professor Jared Diamond?". This part of the documentary was so bad it could have been a spoof. The worst was when Diamond turned out to cry and cry when he raised the malaria department of an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel." BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Can the Europeans get weapons, bacteria and steel out of this serious situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When he finally comes to business, his theory is equally interesting and completely boring. Europeans captured the indigenous peoples from other countries because they had guns and fine leaves against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me? The parts of his theory explaining how the Europeans came to get the benefits that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper thin. In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as talented as Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I already know this. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond won't convince me with his bumbling use of native tools. I don't think adults are the intended target audience for this documentary. The kids can enjoy this more than myself. I've read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
