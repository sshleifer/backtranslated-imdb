This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-spouse of Conan Doyle's famous novel The Lost World. And it shows. <br /> <br /> The movie is promising enough, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al. Returns to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then it goes downhill. Everyone is stranded on the plateau, and we are back with a weak, boring, elongated rehash of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs (almost never seen) are just ridiculous. Are we expected to take that naughty toy that was going to be an ankylosing urge seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the place. <br /> <br /> Get yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Amazingly, at this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the thief version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent reprocessing.
