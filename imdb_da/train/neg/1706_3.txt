Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as read in other comments, this movie has no plot, no character development, they may have some kind of script, but it's hard to tell based on the actual end result. <editing this movie was really nonexistent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or something to help the viewer decide what actually happens. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not well thought out, has poor acting, poor dialogue, bad everything. The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think this should be where they used the money they might try to justify. <br /> <br /> Unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and seeing all the zombie flicks you can find, don't see this. Period.
