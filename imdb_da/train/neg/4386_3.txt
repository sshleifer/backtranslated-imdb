With a title like this, you don't know to expect a great horror movie. But it was really bad, even with low expectations. The reason is really insulting and stupid: An escaped criminal has a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's another. This joke can actually work in 5 or 10 minutes, but not in the whole movie! the actors are not that bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is boring and even stupid. No excitement, no excitement and a little gore (very cheap). Satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically on it. It got so boring towards the end that I actually stopped seeing 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't break what happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but come on. It was 13 years ago and she hasn't done anything decent after that. So no wonder she had to sink as low as this piece of shit .. Avoid or be warned ..
