This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on it too.) Even though it's true, it's still a movie, and this is a movie scene. I realize that independent movies find it hard to get good actors, but wow. The only even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But himself he could not make up for all the actors (including the one who played him as a young man) utterly thrilling plays. Granted the script was terrible clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone because it is so poorly done in each category. Read some books about the Mason's true story, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
