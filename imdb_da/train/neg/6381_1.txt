This film is about a group of extra-terrestrial gay men who exterminate women on Earth to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I saw it with the intention of seeing how bad it was. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie made 50 years ago. The action, if any, is ultra bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making any college movie look mega budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, and at least jaws fall, as others have commented, but the jaw is embarrassingly embarrassing. One must be heavily intoxicated or in a changed state of consciousness to appreciate this film. If I was from Denmark, I would be seriously embarrassed and humiliated that my compatriots produced such a scary bad movie.
