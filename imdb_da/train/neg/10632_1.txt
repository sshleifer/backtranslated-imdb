There are so many wrong statements in this so-called "documentary" that I even cried on television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel may produce a flashy-looking DVD, but unfortunately he lacks the ability to look at the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> He trusts that he is either inaccurate, does not tell the whole story, or the old favorite "government is always to us" innuendos, and people believe in what is told them and do not control the accuracy or the details behind the claims. <br /> <br /> Also, his "exclusive" or "handed" footage is freely available over the internet from various locations. <br /> <br /> Further reading on the circumstances of the film of this production shows that he used false delays to get interviews and used creative editing of the responses to advance his own opinions. <br /> <br /> All the demands made by Mr. Sibrel of "inaccuracies", "errors" or "whistleblowing" in the Apollo program has been profoundly disproportionate. <br /> <br /> How do I get back the 40-week minutes of my life?
