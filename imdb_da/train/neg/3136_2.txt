There is very obvious hype associated with this movie. Let's just look at it, though the main reasons why anyone would see it would be for Leo and Cate, who aren't necessarily the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I say they stink in this movie. Special effects were decent (and I would say that the filmmakers did a good job making the ship delicate), but it has even more big flaws. For example, just before the ship goes down, you can see an unfinished blue screen behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the story of the real Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was horrible - there is no reason why a movie is over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and writing and manuscripts were terribly styled. <br /> <br /> I would say that the music might be better than I could have predicted (and not just "The Song" will also be on). There is a scene that separates me when the ship sinks, and there are rolling bass sounds. It might well be the highlight of the movie. Regarding the atmosphere throughout, it was extremely boring. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, as I know, cannot be what the director intended. In a nutshell, I find it terrible that they made the beautiful story of the Titanic into an overhyped chick flick.
