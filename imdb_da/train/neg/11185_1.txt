Yes, MTV is really a way to market Daria. What started out as a smart teenage anxiety - "comment on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life" sitcom now mutated to a "how to deal with your problems" -charade. I used to see Daria all the time and loved it. Now I sit here after seeing the so-called "movie", I can only wonder what the meaning of this whole was. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Excuse me? Didn't the point Daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it's okay with yourself, no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it? This whole thing reminded me of the scene in the "Reality Bites" movie channel showing the document for the first time.
