Before I watched this movie, I read a review here stating that this movie might be one of the best movies ever! ha ha Scene after scene the thrill grows okay ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just running without any message (and who was the guy on the beach talking to the little boy!) ... things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this movie. When I looked like the movie went in one direction, it just doesn't go anywhere but in a new direction ... and again and again ... The play is amazing, but the writing is horrible. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic, and the reactions of the companion / extras are simply weird. There are no solutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a great waste of time.
