At what time does a good movie settle for bad? When does a movie from "watchable" to "where is it & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF switch"? Thank you very much for DVDs like this one that can be borrowed from the library - for free! Also, thank you very much for the "fast forward" button on the DVD player. I'm sorry for the people who were duped at the box office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I forgot exactly as it is just a veil), our "hero" Luke Wilson starts running through traffic; I think he was looking for a cab. It was at the time when I gave up that I could not bother whether he found his turn or was driven by a garbage can. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbed out of the dumpster, hand dryer, and first met "heroine", Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the money-killing criminal who hanged helplessly out of the fire extinguisher far beyond the departing Luke and Uma. It was the last time the movie was fun and when was that scene? Ten minutes in the girl <br /> <br /> Every time the movie tried to become "fun" it couldn't. Every time the film approached "excitement," it jumped out and went in the opposite direction. When a musical score could have helped push the life out of this dullard, the soundtrack remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were not necessary and were out of lame; The damage to the sets and props is unnecessary and childish. When Uma becomes the crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt as if I was watching "The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; That was when I realized there was no return because I did not really like "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Pulp Fiction." <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson's sidekick, Rainn Wilson (also seen in the sad "The Last Mimzy") adds nothing but insult to injury in this horrible movie. Rainn Wilson, the King of TV Boredom, should remain with the equally horrible medium. Hey, Rainn Wilson! Add full-length movies alone! Every time Uma's rival, Anna Faris, came on the screen, I was expecting Jason or Freddy or some frightened girl pattern to jump out from behind the stage; When you see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie", it's all you ever see, regardless of the movie, whatever the medium. The character that Wanda Sykes played was just awful and so out of place in this flick.
