How this waste was set to film is over me. The only actor who is known to me at all is Judge Reinhold, a accomplished actor whose presence is just a reason to put it into production. <br /> <br /> I don't even think it's worth nominating for a rotten tomato award, making this movie truly B-movie for a movie experience. A car that runs along the highway with the police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, right. The script must have been written on the back of a cigarette board. Most made for television movies are horrible, but it transforms the word. See the bridge operator's real skills, pure Oscar material.
