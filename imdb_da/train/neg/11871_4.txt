Gregory Peck's play was excellent as one would expect, and the filmmaker was amazing even when playing directly into a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the movie was exaggerated and difficult to see for me anyway. I tried to like it but had to fast forward through the last thirty minutes or so. I feel I wasted a few good hours. Had it not been for Gregory Peck, I would not have lasted 15 minutes. 10.4.
