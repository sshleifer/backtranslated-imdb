After seeing the low-budget versions of the "Universal Soldier" franchise, I hoped and asked that Van Damme told his role as Luc Devoreaux in another Unisol movie. Well, it seemed that this prayer was answered, but not the way I hoped. Universal Soldier 2 is just as intense as poetry reading at your local library. No, even that would be more exciting. The fighting sequences are top notch, Bruce Lee's quality, which is the only redeeming factor in all of this pathetic excuse for a movie. It and with the former WCW heavy guy's legend "Goldberg" plays the villain. But placing Goldberg as Seth's sidekick lieutenant would have been better. <br /> <br /> We insulted me most where the film itself was. It's like some film school students put it together. The plot holes are bigger than the Kanye West's ego is what really made this movie. For example: Luc's daughter Hillary looks like she's at least 11-13 years old, and the first movie was filmed just seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me! The part where Luc's partner was killed and turned into a Unisol is just beautiful! You mean to tell me that there was an experimental Unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the film. C'mon. The director could have spent more time with this movie as the first and sewn all the plot holes closed. But oooh nooo! <br /> <br /> Talk about the plot, the sugar! Compared to the first film, Universal Soldier 2's plot won and worthless. Where is the grinning excitement where a Unisol goes custody and restores his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking his desert storm or something? This was the millennium you would attract more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia / Orwellian type of future cesspit. Corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad, sad and sad sequel. <br /> <br /> From what I saw: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and Hell, even the cheap-ass / no class Terminator knock-off "Class of 1999" is more entertaining than this!
