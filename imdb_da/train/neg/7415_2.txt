What do you call a horror story without horror and history? <br /> <br /> This is the most annoying thing about the movie: I get the feeling that the authors have never really decided what is actually going on in the movie! It's another thing to know about it, give hints to the audience and not quite reveal it, but here you get the feel of the scriptwriters don't know it, the characters in the movie don't know it, and the audience sees no one knows it! (Remember "Cube"? Even that movie knew more about itself.) <br /> <br /> I have used a lot of 80s horror / gore movies, and this movie certainly has its roots deep in these movies. But many important things are missing. We really know nothing about the characters. They repeat the empty lines again and again. The story doesn't really evolve - it never goes anywhere. B-acting is OK in this type of horror movie, but there is not much to do in the script. We don't care about the signs. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no excitement, no chills. <br /> <br /> You only get some commonly used elements of the horror movie genre. They show the Lordi monsters one by one, but their characters do not really contribute to the story. I honestly believe that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal crew and equipment. Oh yes, film producers used to do it - and more - some 20 years ago! I felt the common embarrassment of the audience when the film ended. Too bad really.
