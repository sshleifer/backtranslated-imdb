Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who are in this movie, save time and stop reading this review when you reach the end of the next sentence. Forget what you ever encountered on FILM and WAKE ANY OTHER. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idol beautiful boys with invisible, coincident "plot" pulling out in insufficient amount of time until you are ready to scream. Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people who express different emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, without any good reason. We can of course see something incredibly "dramatic" happening, but we just don't give a CRAP, WHY, because there are no backgrounds. <br /> <br /> When that movie is over, you get sick and tired of these stupid, slender, girly faces. You will be upset by having used them all the time to see them smile, snow, cry, look mysterious, be "serious" and any other meaningless expression they strike on their faces. <br /> <br /> That some moron would ever go as far as referring to this piece of unpleasant garbage as being "the soul" of any of its "actors" should show you without doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only the "converted" mindless minions will like this movie, most of them teenage girls with a pathological worship for something androgynous. Freud wanted a market. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of those mindless "fans," keep hell away from this abomination.
