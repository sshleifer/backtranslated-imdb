As if there were not enough floating at that time, we have another paralyzed GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973), which I had seen earlier this year. The tent's name roped in this time is Telly Savalas, who delays into the case and first seen from behind, rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beam in the style of French painters! Besides seeing not least Sicilian, he cultivates no accent of any other kind than his familiar features. Antonio Sabato then makes an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resilient leading man; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal with an eye, is also convincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved in the latter's exciting teenage niece)! In addition, for a gangster flick there is a valuable little act to talk about, and none of it is in any way memorable (though the final of a clinic is handled well); Furthermore, the score of Francesco De Masi is serviceable, but nothing else. Incidentally, the purchase basement DVD I rented starts in the middle of the credits, so none of the cast members - or even the movie's title - has ever been listed!
