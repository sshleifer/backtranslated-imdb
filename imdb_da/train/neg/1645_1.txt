I just watched this movie last night and I had to give a warning to someone else considering watching this movie. In a word - don't do it. I really feel this is something that a writer student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, ie. every other word was a curse word. I don't have a big curse problem, as in "Good Will Hunting," provided it helps dive into the characters. In this case, it was just hollow banter trying to draw an occassional * gasp * or laughter from the audience. The three main characters are all their own unique stereotype, wall street jerks, coffee bar, and "I'm-non-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine Side" of-a-jerk. You just don't give anything for any of them! They are all superficial, irreparable losers that you will see lose. For those who dare, this movie has a few fun moments, right from the beginning and end. The toilet / vibrator stage is fun on a sick kind of "Uh, yes" way. But even if I only recommend this movie to my worst enemies.
