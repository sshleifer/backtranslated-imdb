I think this is one of the weakest of the Kenneth Branagh Shakespeare works. After so much effort as Very Ado About Nothing etc. I thought it was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest grip was that they were messing with Bart's work and cutting some of the game into musical / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You just don't do Shakespeare and then mess with the game. Sorry, but it's just wrong. I love some Cole Porter like the next person, but jeez, not mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and see "Prospero's Books" to see a brilliant Shakespeare adaptation of Tempest.
