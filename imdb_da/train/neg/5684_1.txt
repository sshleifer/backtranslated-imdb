badly directed waste. a mediocre nihilistic sadist gorefest ... if you are the kind of person who likes it ... see a shrink. Even if you are the person not doing a good movie, the action is really bad, the story full of plot gaps, the director should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for it. I can see why people don't like rude ball .. we've had a couple of his movies lately and this is the best of them, which is really sad! A complete lack of any kind of humanity seems to suit some people, but here it only hits. Horror movies can be full of desolation, they can be miniature works of art, they can just look good when there is nothing else on ... SEED is just really bad.
