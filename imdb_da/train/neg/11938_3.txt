The movie started well enough. It had a colleague hit by a glowing green meteorite, few superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, ransom, flight, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, heat view and ability to grow large and fast) and fight crime. From there it is all the way downhill. Meteor Man gets a costume from his mother, struggles with the resident gangs and has many interrupted encounters with the gangsters who serve to set you up for the disappointing, longing and stupefying ending. It would not be so remarkably bad if it wasn't like watching a boxing match where the two warriors pretend to hit each other while the audience is standing looking forward while the warriors just continue to dance. <br /> <br /> Despite all this nonsense, the movie has good points. It is clear that if you try to take a gang alone, they will return to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs and societies need to see their real enemies (the big bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people into a ghetto existence). It also states that people do not need super helper if they are willing to work as a community, destroying the predators that harm them. The only message it really lacks is that voters must secure their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H. W. Bush) are not crooks. <br /> <br />
