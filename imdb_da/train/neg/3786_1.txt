This is not really a proper review as I didn't see most of the movie. I stopped seeing it. The film is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that's why I didn't stop seeing. <br /> <br /> Here was the problem: I just looked enough to be introduced to more characters, all of which were not interesting. Everyone was a boring, despicable psychopath, without engaging personalities, which gave me nothing to look forward to. I found myself not least curious about what they would do next or what could happen to them. <br /> <br /> Once there was a person of interest and I don't mean good or good person, I mean an interesting person I could have stayed with it. See "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In that movie, the Gary Oldman character is a complete lunatic, but he is * very * interesting. Al Pacino may have done a good job in Scarface, but his character just hasn't engaged me.
