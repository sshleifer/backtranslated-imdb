First of all yes, I am white so I try to tread lightly into the ever sensitive subject of race ... anyway ... White People Hate Black People = BAD but Black People Hate White People = OK (because we apparently deserved it !!). where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie in addition to accidental comedy scenes: the infamous scene was ice cube and co. come into battle with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking neo-Nazis and win !!! the neo-Nazi, where twice the size :), and the hunt! the hunt is invaluable ... This is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not deliver ... this is a racist movie that confirms all the clich√© stereotypes, the white wimpy guy being handled by his black roommate transformed automatically to a skinhead ... cmon simply terrible I am ever sorry to see it. Save your time and the horrible experience of a poorly written, badly acted, boring and clearly biased picture if you are in the subject, go and rent American history X, now is a movie
