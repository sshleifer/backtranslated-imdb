A leader who is very successful in his business, but who is very incapable of knowing in his familiar life, meets a boy with impaired syndrome who has escaped from a home. Both characters feel very alone and the seemingly less intelligent will show the executive beauty of the small things in life ... With this argument, somehow Amelie-like atmosphere and sentimental music, I did not expect but a moralistic disgusting movie. Still, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite violent guy) and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the movie. The French cinema generally has the ability to show something that seems pretty much to life, unlike the more stereotypical American cinema. But because of that, it is very disappointing to look for the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happy leader's family, the cheap morality, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from heaven like Michael Landon .. Really ugly, in my humble opinion.
