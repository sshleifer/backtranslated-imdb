I've had one thing for this Kari chick for a while, and as far as she saw in this movie, no complaints. But after catching it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure it is the only thing in the movie that is not subordinate. Scripture is horrible, the play is terrible, the direction is horrible. In another comment I saw that someone commented on how big sex scenes were ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so bad, you might as well make it into softcore pornography, but instead I see a little pasty white dude that prevents me from seeing Wuher's body and scenes that don't give me anything except a tease. They should just have gone cinemax, so the movie was not a complete waste of time, but no. With a script this horrible they should have capitalized on Wuhrer's appearance as it is the only movie. 2/10 only because she looked so hot.
