The Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of itself. This Fantasy is modeled on the series "Walking with Dinosuars". Although this is 100% imagination, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing fantasy draws with T-rexs and the extermination of dinos. Added to appearing on an educational channel instead of saying Sci-Fi, it gives a true authenticity to this show. On its own, the show is about 7.5 / 10 long as entertainment goes on. But the way it is presented, I must give it a 1/10. Don't make me wrong I have no problem with imagination, but the way they put this out is so wrong. I can really see young children and slowly adults who think they found a dragon and that this is real. <br /> <br /> I also think this weakens the big series of "Walking with Dinosuars" because now you have to see it with a mind about how much imagination is on the miniseries.
