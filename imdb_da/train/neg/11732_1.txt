The IMDb guidelines indicate that you must declare whether your comments contain 'spoilers'. <br /> <br /> Now, this whole movie is something of a spoiler ... a cautionary story that heals what it warns against, a tale of lost youth who doesn't know where it goes. <br /> <br /> I just saw this at the tribeca film festival. This movie wasn't just bad, it was really bad. The play is inconsistent, the characters are the smallest clich√© offerings, and farnsworth's plays were particularly bad. <br /> <br /> from the patronizing accents to the meaningless plot line to out of place 'graphic' elements for the repeated dialogue and scenarios ... it sucked the big one. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a more edgy, up-to-date drugstore cowboy with a touch of 'natural killers', but it's not how sensitive to the characters like the former and no where as shocking (outside some frat levels) as the ladder. <br /> <br /> Anyone really needed to A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things in it to build on and clear <br /> <br /> offer with a valuable topic ... if he-handed in that experiment.) B) edit the movie. If it was cut to a core, it may be acceptable. <br /> <br /> I'd go lower than 1 if I could ... like maybe zero kelvin.
