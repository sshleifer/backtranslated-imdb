It really is a terrible cheat of a movie. Its 70 minute run is very well padded with stock footage. The rest are non-descriptive exterior scenes and cat interiors. The presentation of the plot is very poorly reproduced. They are all just perfunctory scenes kind of strung together. There is no attempt at drama in stage selection, but rather drama is communicated by the players' intensity. Don't ask. <br /> <br /> The ground is about a rocket that radiates a million-degree hot orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth. It is a real-time threat that needs to be redirected if a custom built H-bomb can be shaped and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. Nothing very much here to report apart from a gruesome talk by a scientist against the project because there could be some kind of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities, but this speech made by the mandatory idiot liberal was largely passÃ© then. /> <br /> What saves this movie, something unique, is the storage uptake. I've never seen a bigger selection of fifty jet planes in any other movie. This is by no means a complete list, but only some of the planes I managed to see. There is a short interception of a pilot flying in alternative shots, an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86. First for scramble interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or Canadian built CF-13s) and even a few CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> For some reason there are B-52s, B-47s and even B36s seen to take off. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles per hour". I don't think so because one of them seems to be a WW2 era Gloster Meteor, the rest of the F-80s. The meteors push the attack, and one becomes a late F-84F with a flight of early straight F-84s attacking in formation. There is a strange tandem cockpit version of the F-80 that doesn't seem to be the T-33 training type, but a kind of temporary all-weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose. These are encrypted in a blizzard. <br /> <br /> An angled cover air carrier is seen from approx. 500 meters. It launches F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors. Air Force scrambles F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s you've ever seen in your life as well as F-100 Super Saber and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s are pushing their attacks with so much padding. The F-89s relieve their rockets in their wing tip pods in the slo mo. The F-86's fire, an F-102 lets a falcon lose, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With the mid-wing rocket pads loose. There is a very strange shot of a late model F-84 (prototype?) With a straight wing model F-85 over it on a trip, of course a manufacturer's commercial film (Republic Aviation), which shows the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet. Where it went in here is something to guess. <br /> <br /> There are also other large stock footage of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a great place in the road and especially a wonderful recording of New York City's Times Square under one of Civil Defense Drills in early 50s. <br /> <br /> I also think we should deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception for the automatic chase seen late in the picture as the Pacific seems to be in the background. The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat wild and there is also a good TR 3. Canada must have been cheap and it is pretty much used in the background for free. <br /> <br /> As for the actual story about the movie, there is little to recommend the other than the mystery of who Ellen Parker is the finger at the end of the picture. And she's definitely going. Could it be, R as in Robert Loggia? The director who dies before this movie was released? Her career like this was her last credit? <br /> <br /> It's like the newspaper the gift was wrapped in was more valuable than the gift.
