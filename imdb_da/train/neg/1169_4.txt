It is just as interesting as a sheet of cardboard that this unused period piece has nothing to do with it. It is far too proper and fails to spectacularly evoke the tensions and fears that the real characters must have felt as they dodged the weak hand of justice by the French Revolution. Eric Rohmer at 82? It shows.
