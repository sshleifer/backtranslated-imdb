Last weekend I bought this 'zombie film' from copenhagen and watched with some friends who thought it would be a budget version of "Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems like they spent a great deal of their budget on the cover species, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We looked up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and come in the car with some yuppie out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone. They actually talk to the guy before one of the girls kills him; But when they started driving, I couldn't suspend my unbelief anymore. <br /> <br /> Some people consider it really as a "so bad, good" movie they are liars. I did not finish the film, but one of the other reviews mentions that they somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me happy not to have seen it all the way through. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez" Don't Look!
