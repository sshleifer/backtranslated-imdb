** HOW TO PLAYERS ** <br /> <br /> Recap: Mia (Helin) returns from the capital Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik, and Gunilla is divorced and moved a city away. Mia is still single and is focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy, and almost hostility between the sisters and conflicts arises around as they confront each other and each has personal problems that they have difficulty managing. As the party continues (and alcohol consumption), more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts arise. <br /> <br /> Comments: To be a work of a new writer / director, it was disappointing to see this movie follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedies / dramas have been following for years. There really are no new elements or ideas. This film draws on three basic areas. 1) Only embarrassing humor based on signs that make them fool. 2) Grief and 3) Anxiety. This step focuses on the last, almost forgetting the first point that the film goes together. No loss though, as the humor there is is not fun. The performances from the cast are good, I believe, even though it is lost behind all the anxiety and soon forgotten. I had hoped there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. In conclusion, there are better ways to spend some time than to see this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
