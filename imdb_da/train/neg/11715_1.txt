haha! You just have to smile and smile if you have actually done it all the way through this movie. It says like something about myself, I guess. The movie itself was created, I think a kind of psychological test, or as a kind of substance, to take you to a place you've never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece, the tractacus (sp?) Said that it was pointless and useless, but if you read it, you would gradually finish to a new level as a ladder and then you could throw the work and see things with clarity and true understanding. This movie is the same I think. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in a long time in such a unique way. First of all, there are snipes. I loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies. and I have suffered through a few weak ones. But even if you know the movie might suck, you would never suspect it could be as bad as it actually was. which is fun of it. I mean it's snipes. You know it can be good, but it gets okay, right? smile. <br /> <br /> So this thing at all levels is pure boredom, pure unoriginality. The reference to the professional is both dead and obvious, yet so poorly done as being comical. There is not a sign in this movie that is interesting, at least. And to make the whole thing more surreal, they have a soundtrack that looks like parts of different Bourne identity type movies, it's just not quite right. In fact, even though it seems close to action movie background music, it just so happens that it's done in a way that will congratulate you wonderfully. <br /> <br /> So all the scenes in the overall pitch, how frankly since the characters are so flat, you're not really interested in what needs to happen, but no matter after it happens and someone is killed, you say Just for yourself, should I see it? what else? What about scenes with dazzling, unpleasant flashing at a strobe light pace for a period that is too long to wear. Let's definitely throw it in. When you are strenuous and your eyes can't handle it anymore, some of them die in the dark, where you really can't see what happened. And on top of that, we don't care. You were passing by from the beginning. <br /> <br /> So I drove in and out a few times, but I almost caught this movie. And it will be something you can see without anything involving your mind at any level. Therefore, it becomes something that you can effectively designate and begin to think of your life where it goes where it is, what we are like humans. <br /> <br /> And that ... that's the true magic of this movie.
