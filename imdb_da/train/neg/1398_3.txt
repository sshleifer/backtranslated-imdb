I bought this (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "Gray Matter". The news of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role fascinated me. As the other reviewers warned, it is a rather boring tale of a top secret government attempt being wrong. And yes, there are plenty of shots, especially a house with a pool in front of it. Some of the signs and interiors are so cumbersome. I think the filmmakers are worried that we might forget who is who, so they continue to tip us off by first showing the exterior of the buildings. It's actually a little fun. After a while, the pot feels like a TV channel station identification logo that reminds us that we see "Gray matter". I also enjoyed two outbreaks of name calls. At one point, an angry subject takes some responsibility by calling her a "Scientific b * tch!". It's just a very insufficient insult. Several scenes later leave another topic of steam mumbling about the "scientific bartard!". It just sounded very awkward to me. <br /> <br /> Someday, this movie will disappear forever. Another decade from now will probably be impossible to find any copies of it. Almost like it never happened. <br /> <br />
