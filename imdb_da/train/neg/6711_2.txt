1993 was the year. It was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas had won an Oscar. Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him? I was actually a paid extra in "My Boyfriend's Back" shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (God God, the producers had a change of heart!) I was in the theater stage. I hastened to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters. It's more of a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, maybe you can check it out. Nothing is close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead" quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. ciao
