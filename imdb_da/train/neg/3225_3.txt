Children love dinosaurs. It is part of their culture. But they have the country before time. The original. At least the film had a heart. This. This movie is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just merge an old story and show it to the kids. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more of the numbers thing. Not as a soul sucks like Theodore Rex, but it's lightyears away from being a land before time.
