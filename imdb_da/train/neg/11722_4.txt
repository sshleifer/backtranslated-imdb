The problem with CONTRACTER is summarized by the opening scene. The CIA wants an international terrorist death, so contact black ops assassin James Dial. The terrorist appears at the Old Bailey Court in London, as the question is, why would they stop a terrorist if he was to spend the rest of his life in prison? He also doesn't want to be in circulation. Didn't the CIA have a chance before he was arrested? If, with a chance, he gets a non-guilty sentence, he must kill him. There is no logical reason to kill a person who is to spend life in a maximum security prison. As the premise sets the story up, an audience can choose to ignore the plot hole, but the assimilation itself wastes fuel on the fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police ball and the taxi they crash into, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot anyone but too far away to consider someone from a car accident? The film of this type of plot connivance. Later the Dial finds a police officer pointing to a gun at him saying "this airport is surrounded by armed coppers", but Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation. The whole movie cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important supportive character called Emily Day. Why does she help Dial, even though he is a wanted refugee? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thriller and must not be taken in by "big name" cast. Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a movie star, but killed his career by highlighting more and more inappropriate films. Charles Dance also performed in large budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and Alien 3, but again he is one of the best known to look in direct to DVD ticket these days, and he basically plays a komo-role anyway. Lena Headey can continue to become big players in the cinema, but they fail to put the CONTRACTOR on their CV
