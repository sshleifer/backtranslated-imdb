No, it wasn't one of the ten worst movies of the 1980s, but it certainly skirts at the bottom of 100 somewhere. This movie looks as if it was shelved for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain special effects that were pre-dating "An American werewolf in London", discos are still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan is not the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it, let's not overlook the 1970s hairstyles in the 1950s and 60s. I've seen more of it here than in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" combined. <br /> <br /> The one woman raising this movie to "so bad it is good" was the late, big Elizabeth Hartman category, but barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, the Muslim high school teacher who becomes a sex pot, a stereotype that has been made to death and still gets combed by Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" she maintains her mouse qualities. Her call for help is proof of this. She also looks much better like Miss Wimp. "Seven money in the beauty salon, shot to hell." It was not funny. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there are no good parts elsewhere, they are few and far between, and I do not just say that because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. The "Teen Wolf Too" was better than this and it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br />
