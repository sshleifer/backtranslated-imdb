Of the many problems with this movie, the worst is continuity; And editing it on VHS for a college cable channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what was wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually made a much longer movie and then cut it down to standard theatrical display. How much longer? filling in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require approx. three hours of storytelling and character development - especially considering that the film we have is just as slow and takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's staggering; what could the halperines have been trying to achieve here? Their previous film, "White Zombie", was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate the early Universal Studios monster films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and as such, pretty much sat down to the zombie mythology that they in North America would Know from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, zombies revolt seem to have been calculated as some allegorium for the modern war policy. This would not only explain the opening and change of Dean Jagger's character in a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the movie, besides standing around, looking scary and waiting for orders - they 'just allegorical soldiers , not the undead cannibals we all have come to love and loathe in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I'm equal to someone in my reluctance to the modern war and its policies - but I think a movie should be entertaining first, and only later, perhaps, educationally. And surely - a movie about zombies should be about zombies. Really one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood history, but not one I can recommend, even for historical value.
