We loved the School of Rock and Jack Black. We couldn't wait to go see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I would go out. My husband hated it too. The only fun parts were the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stay outside the cinema and tell people to save their money. Scripture was horrible. It had every terrible stereotype of Spanish-speaking people who should be completely offended. The film wasn't that long, but for us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent, it was like watching paint dry. I made my husband stay because I was sure there might be some redeeming parts, but it wasn't. Save yourself money and your time.
