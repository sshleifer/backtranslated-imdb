SHORTCUTS is a horrible and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic based on Noel Cowards playing "Still Life". A doctor removes a grain of grain from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married to social worker of Italian ancestors. They accidentally meet on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each Wednesday. The couple will fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together, they realize that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to share. Coward's original single-act game concerned two common people who fell in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are no idea of ​​'ordinary people'. Loren is especially miscast - Sophia Loren in full makeup who looks like a million dollars, works as a part-time volunteer social worker at a Citizen Advice Bureau, just doesn't call right. Burton, which looks sharp, with colored hair, too much makeup and wearing platform shoes, doesn't come across your average doctor. That said, you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, ceramics around the house all day and is finally boring: The most exciting thing he has ever done is almost an affair six years earlier. Their final scene together will cause nausea ("You have been long, far away", etc.). The great British actor, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute como as Burton's friend, and seems to be a little confused and speaks his lines in a barely audible voice. It's a sad and forgetful performance in a gloomy, horrible rehash of a cinema classic. Avoid at all costs.
