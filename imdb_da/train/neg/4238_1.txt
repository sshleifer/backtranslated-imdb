This movie is horrible. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you cannot come back. The "twist" end is very constructed. The character development leading to this end is not consistent with their final actions at the end. Ninety minutes of preparation - provided the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve - is explained away in literally ninety seconds of "no, we just fooled you." Then the Rob Lowe sign is not even sad! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me," is as sorry for what he gets. If anyone took weeks to convince me, I was dying and then said "No, sorry, just fool you" I would raise some serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from seeing. Please save yourself and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
