So where are the cannibals? Those who are fascinated by the title and the 'real cannibal' appeal of this movie will be let down. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his visit by a village of Papua New Guinea full of natives, one of which was his lover several decades earlier. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is the New York Jewish as they come, and somehow this is interwoven with the documentary film, which he sees in his yamika in several scenes. There are no real cannibals here: only stories reissued by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all a bad movie. Very interesting and good filmography. Schneebaum remains extremely sympathetic all the way through and gives us a fascinating insight into a life that is as far away from Western civilization as one can get. It's just not what it claims to be on the front page and in the plot overview. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
