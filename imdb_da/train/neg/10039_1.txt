This movie is horrible. The action is a waste basket. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Although nature is amazing. I've always wanted to go to Greece. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as for Saif, you'd expect a good performance but even he let the people down. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar, recognized as the pimp of Bollywood and Singh's voice. He was sensational in this movie. For only this performance, Filmfare should introduce another prize. Toiletries cost the worst performance. By the way, the trophy must be a toilet seat. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor. She is first and foremost not comparable to her sister Karisma. In acting, in appearance or in body. She will now prove to herself that she is surpassing her. She comes into this movie wearing bikini and tank tops and short shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan lets his wife-to-be dress like that. But she must have impressed some people who throw that. And if you ask how, consider that every man has an erection that sees this movie. They dream of having Kareena Kapoor in the bed naked with a condom. Including me. Personally, I think she dressed like a whore, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I have to give it a 1/10, but I really wanted to give this movie a 0/10. An unachieved movie.
