I think I agree that many of the comments here should be false. Although the film is not necessarily bad, it is definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost Movie with the premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions that avoid you. The movie already starts with 2 stories resolved inter-webbed, which even later is not tied together. A couple lose their child, who is found cut in bed. They move to a country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is haunted, kind. From here, Dark Remains begins very slowly with some scary moments. (The first ghost performance is fine, and the flashlight sequence also worked very well). OK, so ... The woman sees the ghost of daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear, man trying to solve the secret of houses formerly, woman being depressed, foreign labeled neighbors appear. Its pretty much everyone is there, but the prerequisite for being their own emotions is nice so you wait for the twist. There is no twist, you are just confused by a haunted house history story, the strange neighbor, a completely meaningless, creepy prison, and the dead daughter thrown in with a picture page that reminds me of a lot of "shutter". The end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie, this is slow and with piano music it is quite boring to include some heads of ghosts at once, resembling a zombie girl, of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... Dark Remains could have been a scary ghost story if the script didn't try to go anywhere and arrive anywhere. For many stories, musheden together, who just do not make any sense and contradict the basic atmosphere of the film. And next door ... never use abandoned prisons again. It is so worn and in this case it makes no sense at all. "Hi there is this creepy prison uphill, let's shoot there". I think many ingredients in dark residues were thrown into the mixture like this.
