Let it be for geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this outrageous attempt at a movie. The sad state of the film industry in this country is a product of trying to make a movie out of such a thin material. Most of the images made in Spain fall into two categories: those of the Spanish Civil War that love to present past history as the authors find appropriate. The second type of movie shows the viewer with a lot of free sex because "the creators" have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, we'll see Pere's penis as he tries to cut it off and place it in one of the sponsors at a party. Later, Sandra will show everything she has got to the audience to admire. The story of Pere's attraction for Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is false from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the movie centered on an earlier, better-made picture of Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished for to see in this venture. As for the remarks in IMDb, all the negative voices from Spanish viewers who speak volumes come from them!
