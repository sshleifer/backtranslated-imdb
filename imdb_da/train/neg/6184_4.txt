Brainless movie about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving trips. The couple almost make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people who seek to recover the things that we see falling to the seabed under the opening sequence. Beautiful looks directly to video movies could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in looking good. Performances are useful and the plot is actually not bad, or would have meant that the director and the producers did not redirect the plot to ensure we see lots of well-crafted people in swimsuits (or in what I guess the reason "not rated" Moniker et pair of fleeting bare breasts). The movie never generates tension or rises above the level of an unforgettable movie. If you are roped in to see this, you will not pick your eyes out since the eye is so comfortable, but we really have to stop the producers from making movies, there are excuses for having a paid holiday.
