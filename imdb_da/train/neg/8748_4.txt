It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words, but very naive on the corporate world. The Ministry of Justice would capture several of the major corporations if they did such naive things to win. The real business is much more subtle and interesting, yet equally scary. I seriously doubt that any corp would actually kill anyone directly; Even courage is more indirect these days. In the real world they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, toxins, etc. This film must have been developed by some garage axes, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news.
