My favorite quote from the Crow was when the car got out of the rock, "The movie is so bad even though the car will get out of it!" <br /> <br /> This had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was seriously out there to scare you, making it even more fun! If it wasn't for the Mystery Science Theater, I wouldn't be here today! :-P
