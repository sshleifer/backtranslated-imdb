This movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what is from and growing up in Wichita Kansas; I know for a fact that 90% of the film was Bogus. Apart from the name of some of the victims, nothing else was very correct. The movie looks like it was made with dad's handy-cam. It had recordings that I think came from another movie along with stockings from a slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for the fun of it, but because of the bad actions, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very boring and short end. It was a struggle to see it through to the end. I recommend you don't waste your money on this movie or you will be sorry. Crunch
