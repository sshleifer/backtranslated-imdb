Recap: Ron is getting married to Mel. They are deep and loving and make sure they are perfect for each other, even though they met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law is not so happy. He is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromise situation, get evidence and break up Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: Supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic, but it's not fun at all. It is mostly a pub audience and a juvenile excuse to show little-dressed women. In fact, it is in some way almost impressive to have many you can put in there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, it is also a sign of a movie that cannot support itself. It's simply not good enough. <br /> <br /> It has three redeeming points or actually three players worth a better script than this. It is leading actor Josh Cooke who actually manages to give some impression of some common sense. Sara Foster, I know, has more talent than making movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have much more talent than this movie. What is suspected absent is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are also pretty scarce. It's just not fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
