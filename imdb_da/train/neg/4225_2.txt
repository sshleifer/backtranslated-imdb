This film is another Christian propaganda film in the line of the Omega Code. Not that is necessarily bad, but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to deliver. If you enjoy a styrofoam portrayal of street life and the way the gospel can change a life than maybe you can enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent the Cross and The Switchblade or Mission. When will Christian instructors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals depicting who should not be promised to swear (huh? Criminals say bad words?) And flat signs I really couldn't relate to. It would also have been good if the movie had shown some T&A. Now it would be something I would like to pay to see. Who was the block head that compared this community conflict-thin story of a movie with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
