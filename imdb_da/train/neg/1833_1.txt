Please, someone stops Ben Stiller from appearing in any movie. Write the studies, hell, write your local congressman himself. I've got more laughs at a funeral so I've seen something Stiller flick. Jack Black is trying to do something about a comedy about disappearing dog lap, and Christopher Walken, perhaps by the greatest actors of his generation, simply looks embarrassed about being there. Stiller is his unfunny self, but now even with someone to bail him out, he shows that he is way overstated as a cartoon. It's no wonder why this movie was poorly thought out and was available for dollar cinemas after only a handful of weeks. I warn you and you have to warn your friends, don't see this flick, it's just awful, worst since Gothika (personally, I'd never thought I'd say it), worst plan 9, worst ishtar, worst then The Golden Child. Please Hollywood, stop letting Ben Stiller in your movies, he is not funny, he is a god horrible actor, and he brings others down with him. The following movies were ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed, so while the board says one, I give it a zero.
