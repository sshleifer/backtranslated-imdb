This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but not so bad either. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not scary enough, so I already knew that I would be bored in the whole movie. Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we all haven't seen before. I suppose I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns it turned old and repeatedly. Nor did I understand whether all the things Cusack experienced in the room were genuine or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie just pulls on and when it finally comes to an end, you want it to continue because you are still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. What I liked was the special effects. Apart from that, there wasn't much benefit from it. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
