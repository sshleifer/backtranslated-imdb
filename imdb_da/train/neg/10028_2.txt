I had many expectations from this movie and more since it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his chief Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to run away, but Pooja tells Jimmy she can't do this when she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and it is only that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji is hiring a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Contributors Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, are the film directed by first-time director Viay Krishna Acharya and produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" should be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes! The landscape is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much published weight loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely thin on the story and sometimes makes no sense from one scene to another - so I said at the beginning that I expected more from this movie, as it was a Yashraj Production. With reference to songs, there is unfortunately not a song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are moments where you can laugh and it's mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar, and Saif could certainly have done better while Kareena Kapoor played his part well. But it can't be said for Anil Kapoor - it didn't fit him at all like a villain. Finally, do you mind Aditya Chopra, who has previously produced and directed good movies like "Mohabbatein", what did Yash Chopra do to produce such a garbage game? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time, and that's my first and last impression.
