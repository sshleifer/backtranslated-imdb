I gave 1 to this movie. I can't understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian cinema, made a movie like this, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories from the people involved in the movie are insignificant, boring and not interesting. Too boring. The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. Hope Scola will change radically themes and style in his next movie.
