"Everyone Famous" has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie. It's the story of a man who thinks his daughter might be a star. All he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and journalists. A simple plan that he must kidnap and do for some extortion. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything should be fun, but it is not. It is trivial and lumpy, the signs are low and the end sequence is completely without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you want to laugh, but only how pathetic the whole set is.
