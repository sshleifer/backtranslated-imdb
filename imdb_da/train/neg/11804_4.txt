This 1973 television remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a fantastic Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he's the only reason to see this. This remake is only improvement over the original, that it breaks down the role of Lola Dietrichson, the step daughter of femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's the good thing. <br /> <br /> The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent way: If you saw the movie with the sound subdued, you would hardly get the impression that there was anything particularly interesting. Due to modern bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Because of the bad taste of the 1970s, all sets are distractingly ugly. Walter Neff's expensive apartment is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The modern setting hurts in many small ways. Train trips were a little more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of a construction. Men stopped using hats, preventing Walter from covering his brown hair while posing like the white-haired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in grief ceased wearing veil, depriving Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made excellent use of in a key scene. (Inconsistently, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her founder was trying on a black hat and veil before she needed them.) Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler script the same. But he makes many small, inexplicable changes in the dialogue that leave the manuscript a bit blabby, where once it was lean and muscular. Disgraceful, the famous motorcycle policeman has gone, but look closely and you can see what looks like a post-production edge where these lines should have been. Bochco cannot be blamed. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What could have made this version tolerable is a really nice Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes out as a standard problematic disgrace from "Barnaby Jones." But who can blame eggs? With an instructor who hardly seems interested in what is happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck even come out well?
