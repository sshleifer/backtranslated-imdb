I'm so confused. I've been a great Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all his movies and many of the dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "bizarre." Steven Seagal shares the scriptplay and produces credits on this movie, but I have a very hard time believing that he would choose to double over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter voice no less. What I don't get is if they were to dump some of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to be old as the rest of us. But Seagal in this movie shows only a fraction of the same swagger, self-confidence, bravado, charm and sex appeal, he so easily showed us in ALL his previous films. What I believed most was his cuddly, self-sufficient attitude and his bad ass, so easily shifting into the sweet grin. Where is it in your face attitude and charm that made him such a big star ??? I hope this movie is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - in that case, his lifelong fans must admit that Seagal we all knew and loved is gone.
