Having previously had Wesley Snipes in several action flicks, and I had expected much more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie failed to entertain and although the story is thin and unoriginal, the play is unfortunately thinner and goes to imitate a "worst imaginable scenario "to play" strong "emotions accompanied by some bad plays ... Don't let your time be in this movie, but entertaining, if you want to cry, it's probably enough, even if your tears will cry because of watching Wesley Snipes in the tragic action movie Wannabe Comedy ... I give this 2/10 it was really terrible if you want to see a decent movie, watch the shooter or rent it, that's all the good things this movie is not.
