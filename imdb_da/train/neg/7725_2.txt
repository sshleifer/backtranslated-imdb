This movie is one of the most unintentional bad action movies ever put on film. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is fun enough, but really adds corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a klich√©d love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, And you've got yourself the little suicidal cure for people who enjoy their lives, and until you've seen "Showdown," you'd never considered killing yourself with a blowtorch. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's just me, but the whole gay subtitle is none too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, not even women. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's male parts, and in fact before committing suicide himself, Brandon says to Dolphy: "If we don't, I'll tell you that you have the greatest d --- I've ever seen. "<br /> <br /> Now what is a normal man saying to another man? In an action movie no less? And do you want them to be your _dying words_ ?? Later, this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (about the villain): "I want to cut off some parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Man you have a fixation." <br /> <br /> As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, "Unfortunately, Dolph doesn't answer," I have a fixation? I have a fixation?! You are the one who decided that his last words should be about my individuals! I just had to cut on his ears and his nose, man. "<br /> <br /> These are relentlessly stupid things and fun if you are a person who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain. It's all about the same. Fun for the whole family!
