Let me put it another way: balls. Or what about bollo * ks. This is really awful, more embarrassing than those it is trying to satirize. Julia Roberts is an accomplished actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard. This movie is so lacking in direction, even though she struggles to look good. Usually, she is the perfect professional, but I swear that in the eyes there were signs of confusion and despair. The only thing that could have saved this step was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) transforming the movie into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this theme was not explored to its full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wood, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal had to stick to acting. The two talented ex-Buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly mistaken, and Balfour underused. Ready for Julia to almost prevent this from being the worst movie ever made.
