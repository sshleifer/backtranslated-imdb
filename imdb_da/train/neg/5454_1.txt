Wow, this movie was just bloody angry. So bad that even though I didn't pay to see it, I still wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> The film is about nothing understandable. It is a mish-mash of sci-fi cliches that were made better by much more skilled filmmakers. The performances, especially of the managers, were over the top in a less endearing Ed Wood kind of way. Talking about Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too implied without any hint of irony or sense of humor. Besides that, it is not sensible, even the plot or missing. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are okay, but not enough to go "Oh wow, it's cool" and they just seem to be thrown in to be "cool" rather than being a good plot unit . <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mishmash of things that really never put any kind of mood. Again, it seemed as if the director just threw in the movie in an attempt to be "cool". <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my last point. Perhaps if the director actually concerned more about plot, history and dialogue rather than trying to be "cool," he would not have made such a dorky cliche of a short film. <br /> <br />
