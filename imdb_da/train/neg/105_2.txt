There are lots of great women in this flick. But unfortunately, this movie is naked. Grrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. So why in hell are the protagonists running a Kia Sportage? Hi? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And that's the most hideous effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if anyone broke the job on this, but there was no 3D, just double sighted blurs. I didn't have the same problem with the company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure the 3D in them also sucked, but with them I could see an expression of 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> And who the women were playing the daughter of that ear eating lady, yum! I'd like to see more of her. Also in movies. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
