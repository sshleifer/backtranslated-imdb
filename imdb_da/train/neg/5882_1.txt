Not sure why this movie was announced as a wild, quirky, laugh-filled comedy. There is not much in this movie that will entertain or murder the movie gift. Annette Bening (whose plays were adorned as being Oscar worthy) comes from here as a way, with her performance seemingly routine. Brian Cox's character is confusing and annoying, and the driver plays Augusten ?? Joseph Cross ?? seems to simply not have the personality to carry its role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but she's not enough to join this boring, outrageous movie. <br /> <br /> The movie disappeared quickly, and it seems with good reason. I found some of the scenes tasteless (the scene with Brian Cox and his recently used toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in 'You and Me and everyone we know' and 'Squid and Whale'), some embarrassing, and most of them disturbing. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Don't waste your time?
