I am so disappointed. This movie left me feeling burst out of my time and mental energy. Here's the quintessential Woody Allen movie again: the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites are debating whether or not to cheat on their spouses. Woody, I've already seen these characters, I've already seen the story from you ten times. Where did your creativity go? You must open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change it. <br /> <br /> There are far more interesting and fun scenarios that you can use your brand of anxiety and neurotics - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop again and again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, it doesn't matter to me - for now I have come to expect his old standby: the couple who grow tired of each other and end up cheating. Depressing and same old, same old. If Woody wants to win his fans back then he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not offended.
