So far, nightmares and Dreamscapes have been erratic and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scarecrows, but at least it was orderly, exciting and visually interesting, with solid plays by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini -series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was just awful and not in the good way. The manuscript is bad, requiring the superficial, unlikely protagonists to act illogically to move in the plot, and to have characters in endless surroundings for the lumpy and unnecessary display. The act is exaggerated and unconvincing, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newly married couple in the other. The director used one million tricks to try to make the story scary, but with the amateur-performing spectacle, the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project, with the camera's movements for its own sake and a bit in the way of plot or excitement. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be very disappointed. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment and hope he will get a decent director and scriptwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is too inconsistent to predict either way.
