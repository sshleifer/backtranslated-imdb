I went to see this with my wife and 3 year old son. He seemed to like it much more than my wife and I did. The script is surprisingly bad for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had very hard attention at all. The movie looks great, but the story just gets so strange and long-lasting that I hoped my son would fall asleep so I could get him out and go. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the movie isn't an interesting concept, it's just told weird, (bad manuscript?) especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. I know we should get the impression that the family is crazy but good gentleman, they could have shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (apparently I don't actually have time). At that time I laughed my head looking for an exit.
