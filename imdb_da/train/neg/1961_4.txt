... the children's actors were annoying. It also seems that the decision makers of this movie struggled to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very disneyful mood. <br /> <br /> The grandchild's protagonist doesn't seem to be nearly as scared as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the forest with a dental ghost ghost type individual, you can bet on your ass, I would not be out walking around and driving on my bike. Overall, I've seen worse (ie, waiting), but that's not something I would look again, or recommend to anyone who is bothering it unless you are an avid scammer.
