"Iowa" will be "Requiem for a Dream" for Midwest meth, but it comes across as a tough R-rated "Reefer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad, and meth is terribly harmful, as an addiction, and how it destroys people, families, and communities. But those characters that are either stupid or ridiculous and the eye-rolling plot will not teach that lesson to anyone. <br /> <br /> While writer / instructor / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on display, his partner Diane Foster plays a wincibly stupid, wide-eyed innocent devastated by drugsas already satirized by Susan Sarandon in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show ". I felt really sorry for all the unnecessary nudity she was doing. It was only at the end of the film that I realized that I should think that the two were newly-educated high school students to explain some of their naive beings when we were bombarded by their school pictures, but if they saw, they saw even older than the people at "The OC". While having good chemistry on the screen, they are a pale imitation of a "Badlands" type pair. <br /> <br /> The guest stars are poorly used. Michael T. Weiss, who was so good at the "The Pretender", is quite ridiculous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is simply crazy as his character largely destroys any social significance for the film. Rosanna Arquette must be even more dizzy than she rolled around for David Cronenberg as a very low rental Livia Sopran. John Savage may even think the old baby boomers are sorry if I did a pot, but it's worse. A Goth chick shows, with the odd explanation, that she is a stripper from Des Moines. The obligatory latino drug dealer appears - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the inside view of meth use is depicted quite alive, with quite frightening hallucinations. We certainly see them being crazy. <br /> <br /> While the Iowa sites are being used very well (including an entertaining stage for a propane gab), the accents and church references are confusingly southern Baptist. Guns seems to be used by law law-abiding and offense citizens here more than in any city-city drug dealing film. <br /> <br /> The songs in Iowa's best-known Beard Greg Brown are used everywhere but strangely not listed in the credits. I hope they were used with permission. <br /> <br /> I caught this on his commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it became significantly - and inexplicably - buzz.
