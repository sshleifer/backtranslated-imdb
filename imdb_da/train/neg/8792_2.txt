This film is another example of the curse in East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories rolled into a movie. Other reviewers have, of course, also addressed it, because there are several clauses of "first part" and "second part". How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and story are highlighted in such a short time? I enjoy the first part until it suddenly stopped (it didn't end, it just stopped in what seemed to be in the middle of history) to be replaced by an inane and amazingly second part that seemed to focus on a girl rearranging and clean a guy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai gets a decent script to work with!
