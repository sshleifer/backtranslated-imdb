I have seen very shit in my day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free screening in NY the second night. I can only hope they show the fun version to the paying customers. The big laughs were sparse, the plot was uninteresting, and the signs were, at best, one-dimensional. A highlight is a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and was the only scene I really had a hearty laugh at. Apart from that, I can only remember coincidence and death air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I had expected more of it. But it's short, I definitely wouldn't recommend joining a free screening or payment to watch this movie.
