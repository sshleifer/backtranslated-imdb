Many other reviewers here, including many whose opinions I respect, keep this slice of European sleaze horror in high regard. Personally, I didn't like it at all. It is an incoherent attempt at an atmospheric period between gender and violence. Jess Franco at best makes these kind of movies very good. Unfortunately, the notorious exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's best known films are notorious for their high gross-out quota. This, an early film by him, does not have the constant vile scenes that his more infamous "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" did. In the end, it is an incoherent film that fails to involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor either it becomes very boring. As I said, others have had this movie, but I just found it a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are a few pluses to the movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. But the cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot without connection to the main film. He seems bored of the role and does not have the manic intensity he does at his best. The music score is nice and there are some short moments of accidental fun doing. Still, it's a pretentious and pointless movie that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
