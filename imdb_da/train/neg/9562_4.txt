I think it could have been a decent movie and some of its parts are OK ... but on the whole it's a B movie. Same about the plot, the portions are OK, but it has several holes and oddities that don't quite add up. Trading is mostly OK, I've seen worse of this too. :) Beginning sets the level with cars driving in the desert, making "cool" but totally unnecessary jumping through some small dunes (in slow motion! Cool!) That the drivers had never seen before ... It gets a little better from there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent this, you also need to get another one and use it for heating. Keep expectations low and it may work for you.
