Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> No plot line. Very little character development. <br /> <br /> Full of stupid and pointless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and directional. There was no real ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a mall. <br /> <br /> The same story is chewed again and again until you say "please, just keep it up!" Even the song and the dance were meaningless and poorly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot deals all around ... but then most Bollywood movies have it anyway these days. <br /> <br /> Btw I'm not from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
