An infinite frenzy of wise visual irons does not necessarily create an engaging movie. "Blonde Wig" half of the film never took off, perhaps due to too much self-confidence by its decision makers. <br /> <br /> Wong Faye half (with a very playful if Karen Carpenter sees, Faye Wong) has much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, but the girl-meeting boy's story element takes a back seat for artistic wisdom. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (Cantonese version of the Cranberry smash hit "Dreams") is effectively used in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called "Zhen Tuo." Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is on the official movie soundtrack CD.
