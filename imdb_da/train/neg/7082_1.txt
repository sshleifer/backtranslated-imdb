Ok, I wrote a scathing review b / c the movie is horrible. As I was expecting another review (for Derrida) of mine for pop up, I decided to check out old reviews of this horrible movie. Look at all the positive reviews. The ALL I say ALL come from contributors, have not rated any other movie than this one. Crimminy! and wait for you to "rosebud" [sic] review. <br /> <br /> Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot! They happen to be for the only other films by the two authors and instructors. Holy Window Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as writers and Tony, you couldn't run out of a bad script. No job for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE RESERVATIONS FOR A LOVED MOVIE!
