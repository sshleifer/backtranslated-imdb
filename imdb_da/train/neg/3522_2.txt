If you like standard Sly flicks involving over the top action, incredible stunts (incredibly not meant to be free here) and retarded dialogue; You will love this steaming pile of mountain mug. I had great hopes based on the trailer. I thought Stalone would be forced into his "has-been" days to give smarter people and make an action movie that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, attitude, and (credible) action would prevail. I crave action that is at least close enough to reality so you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least one scene ridiculously ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better, because by entering the theater you want to see a cartoon made in a movie. The character, the setting and everything else is without any comparison to something we might encounter ourselves. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns a mountaineering guide into Rambo before you can say "yo, Adrian!"
