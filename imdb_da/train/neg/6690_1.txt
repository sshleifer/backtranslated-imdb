I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not how close low enough. I honestly could not tell which genre this movie was from seeing it and if it was a comedy, humor was totally missed. The reason was non-existent and the play was terrible. My friends and I managed to see approx. 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before we turned it off and immediately asked the video store to take it back. I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless you intentionally try to watch the worst movies all the time. I honestly do not know how this movie lasted more than a day in theaters, nor can I understand why anyone would want to see it, considering not only the very uninteresting title but also the lack of famous actors / actresses in its cast. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could be the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever had to sit through.
