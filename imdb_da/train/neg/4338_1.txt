really horrible ... lead actor did okay ... the movie, plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it might as well have been a successor to good ... something it had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided as a plague by Carlito's ways fans ... no mention of Gail actually ends with another bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he was caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail. ... they tried to do it like the original with flashbacks in the beginning ... but to be honest when I assessed it, I searched for a zero mark ... unfortunately I had to judge it higher ... <br /> <br /> It was a terrible attempt to get into what was one of the best films in the 90s ... overall it was approx. Â£ 6 and 2 hours in my life wasted ... for all those "actions" in it, it was really boring slow and predictable ... again to any Carltio's Way fans avoid this failure ...
