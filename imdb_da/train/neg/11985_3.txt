Ever wanted to eat worms? Here's a 'documentary' to show you how! Yes ... The child eats live worms! And it's about the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as a bit boring. I totally agree here. The movie just doesn't go anywhere .... unless you're fond of worm eating! This is a movie, it is almost impossible to write a spoiler .... because there is not much happening. <br /> <br /> Now on the technical side: They should have given the baby a haircut. Who does he try to look anyway ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to become the shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> On top of that; the baby was too lumpy to ever look hungry! Would have kept him away from junk food for a few weeks before the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie almost put me to sleep. And my kids could only manage about. 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I admit the landscape was very impressive. And had there been a decent story to go with it, it could have hit it. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for kids to see: The bear scenes and the 'oddball' eye were too weak to scare most kids, and the short 'skinny-dipping' scene didn't show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave this a very generous 3.
