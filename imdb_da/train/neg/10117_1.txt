Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it just looked like the movie for my mood. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the B Horror movie I had in mind. This was much worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I didn't know it was such a screaming man. This movie seemed like a 5-year-old wrote and directed it, and it's good with it. <br /> <br /> I'm an aspiring director, and this movie made me so angry that someone out there actually pays this guy for direct movie. He needs to work in a bin that changes crap where he hears. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting or buying it. I will tell you the same thing that I would tell someone is getting ready to commit suicide. "DO NOT DO IT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT!" I really have nothing good to say about this movie. DO NOT!
