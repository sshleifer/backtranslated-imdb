Omen IV (1991) was a poorly done-for-T.V. movie. Since the 80's passed, I suppose leaders experimented in meth (the chosen drug in the 90s) because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did they even disturb this? And e.g. movie? What did they overcome when this came up on the idea board? They even thought for a second that this movie would catch that. Maybe they thought it could do it as a series? We never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have beaten a few bucks instead of putting this "extra" disc out. Omen IV is basically an average American family recording of the first film. Instead of a snot nosed punk kid, we get the spooky girl who is a total blow to everyone around her. If the family had stronger parenting skills, then none of the demonic events exhibited in past films would never have happened. These parents should put their foot down and make a true discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid at all costs!
