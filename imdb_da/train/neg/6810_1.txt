To be honest, I didn't like the "Executive Decision" - which was obviously the template - much, but compared to this piece of shit, it looks like a work of art. <br /> <br /> Not only the people who move in the movie (the term actors would be an insult to all other actors) should participate in multiple acting classes, the guy who builds the setting hasn't even seen a plane from remote. It's so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight stays are on board, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicality (eg: use sleeping gas, so don't use it, use it anyway), which dropped my rating to the bottom. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun rearranging your sock drawer or drilling a hole in your knee and filling it with milk.
