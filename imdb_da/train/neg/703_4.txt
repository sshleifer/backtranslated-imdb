College students who clear out a condemned dormitory are swollen by an elusive killer. <br /> <br /> The drone who has drunk blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movie production values ​​are quite low, and the story is mostly routine, and there is even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact, much of history's construction is pretty forgettable, afraid of one or two brutal murders. But the film really gets better with its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and a rather bold, unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The noise is mostly missing. Stephen Sachs is the best of the party as he does a pretty good ride in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as a bad student. <br /> <br /> Over all this is a fairly standard B slasher bet, but the finals are worth enjoying and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete hound. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
