There are many very talented filmmakers / actors in Germany now. None of them are associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why in the world do manufacturers actually invest money in something like this here? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget for this waste! It is not entertaining to have seven adult men running around like dwarves pretending to be funny. What is fun, however, is that the film's producer (who happens to be the oldest guy in the pile) plays the youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with moments screaming for captions that say "You're gonna laugh now!" It's hard to believe that this crap should be a comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, many people left and left the cinema for 30 minutes in the movie. I should have done the same thing instead of wasting my time ... pain!
