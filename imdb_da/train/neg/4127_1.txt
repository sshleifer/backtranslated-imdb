A movie that is as bad as this must be withdrawn from all stores around the world. So full of dull, boring, imaginative characters, and with a protagonist with such an annoying attitude and dry voice, constantly giving thoughtless voice to any action and feeling, this movie holds the record for the most challenging movie I've ever seen. Having paid money to own it, I felt a duty to see it through and how I regret it. My head is hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their meaningless, plot less life. A bunch of children who have zero knowledge of anything are all greasy and worst of all, have terrible dialogue all the way, just roll around as the protagonist tries to get a date with the girl. Drilling, so much, my friend shook with hatred and I was red with embarrassment, which I had thrown away 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the following day and I didn't put much of my money back. Avoid like the plague.
