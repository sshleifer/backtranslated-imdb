Although it was not a Sam Rockwell fan, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'Joshua'. Heck, I wasn't even aware that he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying that I saw the movie on the basis of the film, not the leaders. A kind of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen' or another demonic kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slowly, incredibly slow and flat. Nevertheless, I continued to see how it all would solve, hoping to be convinced that the final climax would shed light on the subject. Okay, I admit it did (a bit bit) but what a stupid closure. And what a low low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls ?? You don't see the drop, you see someone lying in what seems to be blood. A person is hit by a cab ?? you don't see you see any complaints, keep a bike up. I'm not sure if this is called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic father who is trying to balance everything, a child ?? Joshua, who may not be the antichrist and a newborn girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she lives? And what was that about? Are there rats over or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of the beginner's family? Should he grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the brink? I do not think. They were nuts ahead and no "so-called" plays could make me believe in anything else. Unfortunately, almost all questions were answered, almost no open doors closed. I'm sure could have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty of better kid-gone-wild movies to explore. Joshua is more like the Antichrist Mini-Me.
