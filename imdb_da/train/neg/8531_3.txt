In this unforgettable triviality, the 40-ish Norma Shearer plays a fluttery, gigantic socialite in Monte Carlo caught in a riot between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the movie's failure on the boring, spoken script or director George Cukor, who never seems interested in living up to the film's generally comatose state. For the most part, it is Shearer's self that desperately would continue to play "young" parts as long as she could get away with it. Unfortunately, this "Her Carton Lover" makes a bizarre monument to an aging woman's vanity.
