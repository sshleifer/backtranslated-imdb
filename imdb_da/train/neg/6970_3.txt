Now it would be a kind of clich√© if I started with a little about the title, so I'm waiting for it. First, this film made me wonder why children are doing stupid things like walking around in labs and breaking bottles. Then I realized it is a movie with a message, the message is beat kids, and things like this will not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster grow up and cause a bit of chaos before they die in the typical "kill monster indirect" fashion. Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has no Blue in it or any Simian of any kind. Now it is like I was cheated or something. The picture on the cover had a huge bug / crab / idiot / thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses. It just happened, but I wanted monkeys! just enjoyed most EXPREME PRIMATE a couple of nights before (half drunk on Cask and Creams brandy mind you) I was in the mood for several monkey hijacks 80's style. Not so much. If you like snow boarding monkeys or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like bugs and good reasons for hitting children, you need to rent this.
