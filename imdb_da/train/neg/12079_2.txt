The bad will would be rolled over into his grave if he could do this this horrible German TV adaptaion of his classic game. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. A scene riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass as a set. The film was mistakenly dubbed English, with the English voice actors occasionally muttering their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and upset. And where was the Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this regrettable production the treatment it justly deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this movie was never in the first place.
