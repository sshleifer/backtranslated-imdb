I watched this movie in the middle of the night as I flew through the canals and there was nothing else to look at. It's one of those movies where you stop seeing what it is - just a moment! - But realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of the movies that is somewhere between being so bad, it's good and so bad, it's just plain BAD, it's worth looking just to experience the confusion of realizing that both are! Great middle-of-the-night fare if only for the amazing tennis drag. Not even disturbing asks yourself why no one can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because the logic does not apply.
