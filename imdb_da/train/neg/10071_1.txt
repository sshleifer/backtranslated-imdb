I watched this movie at its premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> When American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I was hoping for a towel. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, numerous movies I've seen at nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towel Head, is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to leave early. The worst problem with towel head is that it naturally comes from a collection of "provocative" concepts about cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. The play comes from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I've never known a novel that was good enough to be good, even though it was adapted to the author's political views. This observation is particularly damaging to the towel head, because its political views are so outdated and simplified. If there was ever a time when the towel head's white male villains, discouraging depictions of black, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc. were fresh, it is far past. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please refer to any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone poorly judges this film and exposes the superficial and manipulative tissue it is based on. On the other hand, amateur reviews seem to be easier to bamboo. As you read through the reviews on this and similar sites, you often come across superlatives: "Stunning", "Breathtaking", "Deep", "Shocking" ... It's ashamed to read them, but it's not Surprise me. In fact, I have encountered many people who seem to consider any book or film dealing with racial, cultural, sexual or sexual issues so profound, thought-provoking, full of deep insight. If you are such a person, clean the towels and move it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can probably pass it on.
