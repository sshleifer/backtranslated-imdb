I imagine the young people involved in making "Necromancy" (also "The Witching" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a little weird creature on the face of a horror movie with the man who: participated in John Houseman in the production of a proletarian game ("The Cradle Will Rock"); frightened people to believe that aliens were invading ("World War II"); and directed and starred in the biggest movie of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles was the lead in a triple bet on a satanic cult. There is virtually nothing creative about this movie. Lots of nudity, but the background music always seems to distract. Although the film wasn't particularly predictable, it was still not worth seeing. How low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, over the past thirteen years of his life, he reported the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros comics from the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend the two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
