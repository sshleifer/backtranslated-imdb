Terrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! Of course I talk about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I only talked about those seasons, this show would have got eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who come after the first two seasons that were not part of the original cast are good. They were and are terrible. Comedy is not fun at all. AT ALL !!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was filled with very talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever she called), all of whom should have been better off after leaving MAD TV. This show is very overrated and worth less for your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun, and let MAD TV soft and die as it deserves.
