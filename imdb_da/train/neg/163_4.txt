The previous part of the movie was pretty entertaining, but at the end it was thin. Although Turturro is an actor I generally like, his Luzhin often resembled a bad Rain Man impression, and the genius depiction as a semi-autistic man was annoying. All in all, it seems like this movie is trying to be hard and end up looking pompous despite most fine performances.
