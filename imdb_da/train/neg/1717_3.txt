Here we have 2 misguided children who never stood a chance against a cruel, poverty-stricken existence: Robin Hood's appointed by the police for persecution because they were sometimes a bit wild. Gad! According to this crap, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic killer of a fun loving lover who wouldn't really hurt anyone .... he just wanted things without putting much energy into getting them. Poorly acted, poorly recorded, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, doing that looked more grainy than the right thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
