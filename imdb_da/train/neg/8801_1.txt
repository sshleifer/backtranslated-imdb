Pieced together from dead body parts (deleted scenes) from the bodies (Anchorman), Frankenstein Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is certainly not a sight for evil eyes (something you will ever see twice ... maybe even For that matter. <br /> <br /> More often than not the non-relativity of the scenes in WURB is made relevant by a third person narrator. Even more disturbing is that the characters in WURB are incompatible with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in the opening story we are told WURB takes place shortly after the original.) At the end of Anchorman was Burgundy grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co-anchorwoman / lover. In this film he is back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to Veronica (clearly, these are the more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman spliced ​​into WURB.) The part that makes this a movie, an ongoing evolving story, involves a bank robbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit through. This part was scraped from the original scripts for Anchorman. <br /> <br /> Most other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternative / deleted scenes from Anchorman. They go to the same party as in the original, the same original "group bitching about having a woman on the team" scene and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica objected to reporting. <br /> <br /> Burgundy recreates their first date with the drive-in spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club, Tinos. Neither character mentions that they have been in the driveway before and when Burgundy enters Tinos with Veronica, he introduces it to her as if they have never been before. Oh, and they have the same clothes on their original date. <br /> <br /> I still have to give credit to the filmmakers - though WURB is no more than a smart way to present deleted scenes. tied together with story. Between the two Ron Burgundy stories - this is the weaker one. Looking back on it, it is right to celebrate for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB. You stay elegant, IMDb. Thanks for stopping by.
