Why? Because of a reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any movie than Ann Margret sings "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. She represents it again at the end too (in another mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Though that's all you see. You agree, I am sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so great, it just didn't need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version gave their "all" but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - it just can't be done! It's even annoying to find yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake, and it just goes short without the actors failing it.
