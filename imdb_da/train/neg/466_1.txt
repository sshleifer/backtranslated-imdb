How could I best express my feelings about this movie: Horrible? a headache? lack of coherent writing? common stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty. And just for the direction. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I think there's a story. Two stupid blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course. They fail for a 'world war killer' (sarcasm) and become 'employed' by two 'mobsters'. One thinks "take him out" means a date, and the other gets the smaller actor she dreams of. And of course, the turtle must reserve for the turtle that they build with casino winnings. <br /> <br /> Sounds like all this could be fun? Guess again. They are trying to make fun, but it is not. Movie sequences are not well done. I've seen better movies in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are average for a late 80's movie. But the problem is that it is a 2007 movie. <br /> <br /> Not worth my time to ever see this again. It still doesn't beat Danny Glover's "Out" movie from the early 80's as the worst movie of all time, but then the movie is once again in a class. "F"
