I just finished watching the guinea pig - Devil's experiment. I must say that this movie, although it has very good FX, better than I expected, was not a good movie. I honestly can't say I have had this movie at all. Of course, it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minute torture, but I found it very boring (and not as horrible as I hoped). And also I found out that the tortures were very annoying when they talked and lied, tried to sound loud all the time, it ruined it even more (and I'm sure there are some people out there who would agree with me about this). I have now seen guinea pigs 1,2,3,5 and the best of those who, in my opinion, are guinea pigs 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I will not say much more about Devil's experiment, except for Great FX, descent, acting from the girl, annoying humiliation, generally I give it 4 stars because of FX cos, they are awesome.
