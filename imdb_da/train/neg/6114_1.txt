Because that's all she does through this whole movie, gets naked for no good reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, she suddenly removes her clothes. Where's Tarzan Poisoned? The whole movie is turned up. They couldn't get the animals to this movie to the right. What was it about an orangutan hanging around the chimpanzees? He must have turned off with a much better movie. The group of cannibal tribal men looks at the caucine. Why? And why was Bo and her father painted if they were to be eaten later? It was probably just a bad excuse to show her breasts and curves again. Her father, while chasing, approaching and acting stupidly around a thistle elephant while standing too close to it. A true African tyrolphant who was not from the circus would have stamped this moron's scales. A smart hunter would have started shooting the moment he saw it. And I can't do without wondering if the camera was on LSD because it continued to display various scenes that went in slow motion without good reason. It made no sense at all. The boa-constrictor that Tarzan fought with in the water resembles one of those 12 ft rubber hoses you can buy from a local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan was strangly spared in this movie, perhaps from Bo flashing her so much. I'm sorry, but it's a rip off of a classic black and white Tarzan movie with a similar but better story. Not to mention plotting. There is a scene in it I saw that everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * The scene where he tries to save Jane and her father is too close to a running water pipe. It made it seem like he was urinating on someone under him. Eww! Also he and Jane are fooling around on a beach, with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping. She made sure her father died really well. * (SPOILERS END) * There should be a surgeon's general warning on this movie. watching Bo naked too much in this movie makes you go blind.
