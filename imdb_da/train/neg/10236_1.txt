Absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of cinema-purists shock their lattices, let me elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, it is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen and is definitely the worst movie I've seen in the cinema (an impressive claim that I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leaders (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were, at best, convincing and totally annoyed at worst. Of course, they were not helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterization that was as convincing as the OJ defense. The reason (to stretch the word a little) was thin to non-existent, and the 'gore' scenes were undoubtedly brutal irrelevant and ridiculously formal. Which plot is about a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) abducted, imprisoned and exposed to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like interrupted set pieces and the emphasis was put entirely on shocking rather than scaring the audience. While there are really a lot of very few positive things to draw from this movie, its redeeming features are the very mistakes that make it such a horrible movie. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a movie theater. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was stitching and remained that way all the way through. For my part, I came out washed by laughter, buoyed by a film that had risen to the top of scary filmmaking. No matter how you look at it, this is truly a cinematic performance and a blueprint for future directors wannabes, which detail how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I did not mention that I managed to get into the movie free ... so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back ... it was really that bad.
