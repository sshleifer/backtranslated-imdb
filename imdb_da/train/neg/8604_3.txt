Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a small part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there are murderous snails in his small town. Not just any snails, remember you, but carnivorous killer larger than usual, mutated by toxic waste loops (which still only go as fast as a normal slug that is not so scary but I go down). No one will believe in him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> OK, killer snails are just above psychotic sloths and just below Johnathon Winters as Morks baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdity of it all is quite clear from getting gone. The flick is fun something through and is of 'so bad that it's good' black. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was snails: The Movie unlike Snails: Children's Games or Snails: The Other White Meat. Probably not worth seeing it more than once and immediately forget it except to play a rather unclear trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is more known for his earlier films "Pod People" (which MST3K deserved mocked) and "Peices" (which is probably the funniest bad movie ever made).
