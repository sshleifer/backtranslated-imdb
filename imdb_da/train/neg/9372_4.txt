This is a typical late Universal Horror flick: it is technically competent if it happens to the numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overactive. The most interesting part of this movie is its stunt cast of Rondo Hatton, a man with bone disease as the movie's "monster". It is sad to see this man being exploited, but he has probably spent the money they paid him. Hatton is less horrifying than the study hoped, as I often felt sorry for fear or even disgust. Martin Koslack is aboard the movie's crazy artist, and he is very entertaining in this part. I look forward to seeing Koslack in almost everything For some reason, the man offends me. The only other part of the movie that entertained me is the film's absurd recordings on the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who enjoy their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the movie's male "hero" who is an "artist" who paints ... get this ... pin up girls. Somehow our hero's work has been reviewed side by side with the villa's absurd sculpture. Also entertaining is the film's haughty critic who at one point claims to despise the hero's pin up art because "women like it do not exist" that our heroine replies with assurance that the critic just doesn't come out enough. Finally, there is a part of a subplot about the heroines (who are art critics themselves) domesticating the leading man .... totally anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. Overall, this film is a pretty mediocre picture with some entertaining elements.
