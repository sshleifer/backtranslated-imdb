"Houseboat Horror" is often regarded as the worst Australian movie ever made and described as a typical slasher film that brought the promotion "Watch the movie that can't get an Academy Award". An underground disco band members start dying slashed to death by burnt madman as they try to shoot a music video on a distant lake in the Australian outback.Badly acted and written slasher flick with zero excitement and annoying characters.It certainly delivers Gore: Heads is divided in half with a machete, the neck is cut, and a woman is killed with horseshoes. If you like cheesy slasher movies, give it a try, but you've been warned. At least it's better than Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
