Imagine it says 12-12 - your home, your bored, your tired. This scenario arose, say 4 or so years back. I turned on the television and fled over a couple of channels and found out that this movie was on. OH MY WORD This is the worst movie I've ever seen! A running car that cannot be stopped (because the brakes have been cut or something) by clearing it down the highway - what should happen? This movie was so bad, it's actually fun - I think the stunts cost about $ 2 to make. There was an instance where a child / toddler is picked up from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a conveniently located bridge is approaching ahead ... THIS IS THE BEST BATH BY A MOVIE EVER - it shows the child who misses the bridge, but it looks so bad - you can almost see the mark of the dummy they used - overall low budget classic! Can't remember the end of the movie, but even though I knew it was great <br /> <br /> I doubt they will ever show this movie again so I'm glad I got to see this piece Garbage!
