What about Americans and their religious gobbledy-gook hanging? Believing this was a best selling novel is incredible, but pulling it out like a movie, you really need good acting and a script that delivers. In this case, all the good actors have gone to heaven and we are back with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type journalist (!) Trying to discover why many people have simply disappeared. Oh yeah, there is a subplot of an evil world conspiracy and famine or something. The good news is that this has been done so cheaply and with such an in-depth dialogue that it has pure entertainment value in all its unintentional laughs. Not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit IQ.
