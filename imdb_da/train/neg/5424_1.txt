Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat out film. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one to punish myself by watching a horrible movie after another. I don't know I needed a hobby in my teens. A teenage outcast (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the terrible power that this antique mirror has and uses it to strike against those who have seduced her. Films like these have an unfortunate side effect for the generator. This changes her in and out if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> A mess of a movie restored for some reason, e.g. a few years back. I do not know why. They should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie enemy for some reason. If you do, I'd like to know why. Until then, I don't like this movie and I have no reason to ever see it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
