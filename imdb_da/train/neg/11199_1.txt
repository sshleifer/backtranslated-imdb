The turgid pace of this movie numbers us for any shock it can give. There was no real excitement. Most of the characters were motionless. The caste Irish priest was as boring as the interest of love. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose to give the film's sensuality could be better. The main character's central conflict was not involved. This film is completely without positives. It's like a boring exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway.
