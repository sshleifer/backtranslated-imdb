The title should have been a walker. The guy spends 90% of the film's time. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Go through life stealing people's identity for nothing. He gets no benefit, no money, nothing pretends to be another person. No body could understand why he pretends to be another. <br /> <br /> The only thing clear in this movie is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest was crap. <br /> <br /> Must be director is a looser who wants to be another. But what he really should do is get a real job, because after his movie I don't think he has a chance to do as a film producer.
