I sat right in the theater bored like hell, I wanted to leave half way through the movie. The reason is simple 4 Samoan boys' wreck weddings. So they need to bring dates to get into the wedding. Grazing. <br /> <br /> The thing that hung me the most was the so-called raw jokes ... They were very unfunny, cliched and thrown in your face to get you into the already boring movie. The play was below average and I felt that this movie just went on and on only a lot of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot. All in all, one of the worst movies I've seen of 2006 is unfunny, bad-acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Thank you, a friend called me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
