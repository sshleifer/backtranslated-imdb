German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has accomplished a task that many horror fans thought was impossible: he is unsigned with Teuton Uwe Boll to the crown of the director of the worst horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really Ed Wood of the new millennium. This movie is as lukewarm and ridiculous as the worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I saw it in toto, morbidly fascinated to look just as low, the column could be set. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a grave and buried it. <br /> <br /> The launch begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only a person who has lived in Los Angeles where every car mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or writer waiting to be discovered could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to vomit their ridiculous dialogue with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, a scruffy beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Apart from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite stopping innocent women's drivers and keeping them in custody, they pull them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture store), and doing all this in general with his curious partners, LAPD refuses to investigate. goes so far as to physically attack one of his prosecutors in a ninja style raid on his occasion. The sets are terribly bad. The production designer's budget apparently includes only enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. As the actors were, of course, unpaid, non-professionals - a sad assortment of European emigrants (possibly deported if they were acting in their native countries), bimbos, mimbos and desperate medieval women - and then little if money was spent on sets, special efxes , places or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they jumped for some really great police uniforms. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; The uniformed police cross the streets in a shiny new mercury rental. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the damaged deeds of our fake German LAPD officer and the useless efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is particularly pitiable because he is the only actor in this entire mess with a vigilant shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdresser and tortured Brando posing to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is where the title gets its zombie, which the victims of our killer resurrect, after killing a girl who had just visited some voodoo achievements to get a protective magic added her. Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accepting Lommel's logic and enjoying the absurd journey. <br /> <br /> After very prolonged towing out of thatched road trenches, the Zombie girls manage to get their look. They look exactly like they did before death, perhaps even more beautiful, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes. The managers don't look like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway. At this point in the film, Lommel borrows a creative note from his tall farmer Boll and injects large doses of cheesy Euro trash techno into the soundtrack. We speak prehistoric electronic hops noise. Things they might have played in an Ibiza discotheque when Lommel was still young enough to shake his prey. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and act as normal ... I mean, as they did before being zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialogue. Yes, it's a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil anything by revealing the end of the shock. All I can say is that it is completely in line with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood's spirit lives on ... or should I say his spirit.
