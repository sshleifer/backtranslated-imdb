Another fierce, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle game: it is difficult to know if he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or in complete oblivion. He also seems completely unaware that all the brilliant images in the world (and this has some excellent) cannot hide a negligence on history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a sympathetic actor who occasionally shows his dark side ('The River Wild') in an attempt to compensate for his boyish appearance; Due to the material, however, Bacon is not nearly hateful enough to force. The other main characters are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom are gifted enough to get a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver unheard of dialogue, scare themselves. The climate is an inquiry largely and unbelievers really have to be suspended.
