In spite of some mildly thoughtful manuscripts in the manuscript and the total curiosity of the film, Wolfman's Fury emerges as a dull, uninteresting excursion to Lycantropy, rescued only by statuary presence of the villain Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including hammy Naschy, are a complete depreciation (though, incidentally, it is not helped by often terrible dubbing). Although the manuscript packs enough variations on the werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau themes to propagate a dozen films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterization so weak and the dialogue so surprisingly ridiculous (at least in the English version) that any latent Interest in the case is soon to be killed. <br /> <br /> Zabalza's direction seems jerky, even amateurish. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. He is not helped by Villasenor's overlooked lighting. Even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a scare signal are signaled far in advance. Other credits fall into a similar pattern of invisibility, although the over-emphatic music score and the ridiculously raw, completely primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
