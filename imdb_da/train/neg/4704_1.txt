A very bad attempt at a young spinal loss. At least the music in the spinal crane was good. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at worst. A bunch of Hollywood execs, bad musicians and producers create some "poopie" show so their kids can be in focus. Oh thank you!!! The potty humor was even bad. I hate these things when there are really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors, and artists) out there who break their bucks to succeed and this shit comes together. <br /> <br /> Help you all !!!! Why wasn't Gene Simmons in it ??? Ameriac's entertainment taste goes down to the toilet.
