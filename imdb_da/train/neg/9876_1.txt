I went in without knowing about this movie and I went out for half an hour and knew everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm a generally good person, but if anyone told me they liked this movie, I'd probably never talk to them again. Anyone who likes it all is most likely to have an extremely dry, hermit type of personality. I also want to include that they think they are also quite intelligent, like the self-centered cruise bags that make the voices the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like me, but it's okay; I don't think this covers any range of humor itself. This movie is as flat and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to go out; It is best to get your money back as well.
