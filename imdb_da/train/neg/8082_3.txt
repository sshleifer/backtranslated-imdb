It was one of the late night "It's there" I saw that thing. Sometimes they are big. This one was horrible, but it really shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> The movie had a really good cast. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking Oscar wins peat here. It had good special effects. It even had some really good breasts! And I mean nicely, full breast with full nipple and at some point even some beaver. But it did not compensate for the missing ingredient - a story! The reason was ridiculous. I don't mean the "sun crisis" sun exploding things, but it was bad enough. It was the rest of those things - those stupid and completely predictable evil things. Man just stinking! No number of good actors or cool spaceships or combat scenes could get around it. <br /> <br /> I've seen the same cast members who are incredibly good. I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had minimal throws and budgets. The whole difference is in the writing.
