Not so keen on this really. The story is pretty angry and convincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns well. Then it was pretty appalling. Tim doesn't fit the role, he comes across as a self-inflicted ass and Pruitt Taylor Vince is totally unconvincing as a trumpet player. It is an idealistic film and as a musician you feel a little offended after seeing it. There are no scenes from 1900 to practice or play with his fellow mates, he is completely complacent. I find it difficult to build a relationship with this kind of character, maybe I see the wrong movie. If you have no true passion for life or the feeling of what the musicians are all about then welcome the suspension of unbelief and see this waffle.
