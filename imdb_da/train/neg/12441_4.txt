Some things need to be clarified. The picture of Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris who was in this movie. I know, because he was my father. Please remove this image. Also, Mark Ferris was the author, at least one of them. I have tried to find a copy or a way to watch this movie again. It has been years, and if anyone can point me towards getting a copy, it would be good. The movie was not that bad, and tried to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other high tech sci-fi's as it was in vain. If you see it, just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses. Light up being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovative movies.
