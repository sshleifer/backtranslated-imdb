Don't make me wrong, I love action and revenge flicks, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's latest "The Mechanik", which is quite good. And Tony Scott probably knows how to use a camera and can even be a movie and editing movie. But with "Man on Fire" (and even more so with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his film-making "genius" skills intelligently, he reluctantly uses to show and compensate for the lack of substance that his material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is close to 2 hours and a half, as it really should have been at least an hour less. The way Scott shot and edited this movie also makes you doubt whether he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his movie because his constant camera is moving and flashing is really a torture to the eye and makes you leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> At times when MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes to ratings, violence, and low PG-13 movies. I also find suspicious that a $ 70 million movie is made of a B-movie script with a sign that cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge death of a little girl who is NOT dead! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or the violence ... Thus, ...
