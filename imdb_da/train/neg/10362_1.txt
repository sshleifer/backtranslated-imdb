Disney? What happened? I really want the movie to be set in the 60's, just as the book was. And I could really have dealt with cheap special effects to save the budget for a more precise fit ..... I'm glad maybe someone might be influenced to read the books ..... but The Man with red eyes that can be replaced as IT? And what happens to the volcanic upheaval? Where was it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! Long ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this movie. I would certainly wish I could id it. I can only imagine that it can be closer to the real story than this bad adaptation. This movie should be X'd.
