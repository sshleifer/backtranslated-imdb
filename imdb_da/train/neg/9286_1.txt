OK first of all let me say that I'm still amazed at how the plot sucks, but once again it's a movie that continues a Steven Segal movie only without Steven Segal round !!! Just random low budget action scenes really no point I'm still amazed, I burned 90 mins on this crap really! <br /> <br /> Just rent a Jacky Chan movie or watch see wwf more fun and have no and don't assume and have plots !!! plz plz plz avoid it !! btw the best actor playing there is bill gold mountain and it says a lot !! and no he doesn't play as well as i said, plz avoid the pfff i still can't believe i wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this !! :)
