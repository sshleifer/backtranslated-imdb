In Phantasm's third series, Mike and Reggie continue to throw the long man, assisted by a tremendous 9-year-old, a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's late brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing successor, as gore and black comedy are much less inspired and exciting as in Phantasm II. I felt stressed only on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a stand-up comedian. The mood of the previous film was much more dry and repressed, which fits a story like this better. Also, the settings are not as macabre here, plus the constant presence of the long man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious ?? There are still plenty of gore but not half as satisfactory this time. By the way, beware of the hard-cropped version, as it shows the most lovely killings on the screen. The entire Phantasm series is Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed four episodes so far ?? the fifth is in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the other is a horror feast of gore and violence, and the rest can easily be skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros portrayed his character much better in Phantasm II.
