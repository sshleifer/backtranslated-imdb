As a big fan of David Mamet's films and games, especially his first movie House of Games, also starring Joe Mantegna, I expected good things from this movie. Instead I found myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Race solutions are thrown away without feeling or meaning behind them, hoping to create a racial excitement that never materialized to me. Identity is completely reassessed, and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Due to his oath taken as a policeman, the protagonist refuses to perform a relatively small act that will not harm anyone and possibly save lives and yet perform another act that is very violent and very illegal, but we refuse still the minor act. In addition, a very unbelievable sub-plot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced only to get a plot point only advertised with skywriting, and the policeman's response to this event extends credibility far beyond any reasonable limits. Needless to say, after waiting another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10
