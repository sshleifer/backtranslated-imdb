Back in 1967, a particular director had no idea of ​​a galaxy, far away or nearby. He tried to complete a movie titled THX, etc. This short is a converted story of a particular George. I'm sorry it has only beauty to defend it. This is just a promotional profile for the director, the actors, one. eel. It has a bit of unique artistic value. It's a brochure. The apartment plays George, is very nice, as is the Leia character, and the replacement Darth character. Everything else is ordinary commercial dross. What a waste. Anyway it got the job done I guess. The rest of the movie is just tapping water to kill the time I guess. only a brochure.
