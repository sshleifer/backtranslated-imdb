Words cannot describe how utterly this movie is. It's a series of random, unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy who gets it on with an old dead lady (really disturbing). The only remotely entertaining thing about Underground Comedy Movie is to watch Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. It is also rated NC-17, lapsing the only ones that can tolerate it.
