I do not destroy anything when I inform you that you will see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If that's your thing, then your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband go and see their foreign sister in the family mansion in the woods. Her sister is a grim lady to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family life. On the side, a group of innocent characters arise and begin to perform all sorts of pagan rituals. The plot is rather weak and the characters are pretty stupid. The woman sticks around, even after her husband begins to become a jerk and hang out with the pagans, even though she continues to have sex with him. On the utilizing side of things, there are very bared meats and a few kinky clutches, but nothing that hasn't been better elsewhere. Oh, and the aforementioned goat-sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most viewers won't make it to the end. Exploitation fans will ride it out but will be left wanting more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
