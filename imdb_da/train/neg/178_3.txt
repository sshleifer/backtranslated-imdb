This movie was made for television so I don't take that into account, so I would get a feature film. The script is underperforming, but it manages to be mildly humorous in spots, whether it means being or not. The action is mostly over-the-top, but it applies to many lower budget films. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated was, however, that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places there will be 5-10 seconds when the footage is recorded video. You can see because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second. Second instead of the movie's 24 images per. Second. I'm not sure if these scenes might have to be shot later, and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot at movies (I guess that's why anyway), but it's disorienting and really makes the movie look shoddy than it does had to look. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've certainly seen worse movies, but I certainly wouldn't say I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend anyone to see it.
