Saw wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to shut it down. Mostly boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was very little excitement. The action was horrible, to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes (eg, church lady). The dead sister used paranormal means to contact her living twin, but rather then sending useful information, she focused on trying to scare hell out of her instead, as much as The Ring. Instead of getting the police involved - as I am sure the earplugs she found would have DNA over them - she instead designs a terrible plan to "get" the man who covered his sister's unfortunate death. I call it a terrible plan because she eventually allows him to kill her too, as the movie then falls to black. Poor dialogue, poor acting, poor ending.
