OK ... I see many bad movies. I'm proud of that fact. many times there are some gemstones in the B-characterized bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I've seen. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot of and movement consciousness. Opening scenes seemed pretty good. Decent music and imagery. Then it goes down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Call in the ears called Tinnitus). Now it threatens to reveal its secret. They made it too much of a focus in the movie. So what he called in the ears and accidentally left an earplug somewhere where he should not have been. It is not necessary to keep it up. So this guy has an affair with this girl and in a motel she fell and hit the head on the end table. So instead of letting everyone know about his affair, he decides to dump the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well after seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie as a ghost) and even pointing directly at the body's location, she finally finds her. Now the body has been restored and she is ready to handle the only suspicion that killed her. Bad is that she didn't have much of a plan. Just pretending to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped. The idiot didn't even think he killed her. So everything is revealed there, and even though she had a gun .... somehow she manages to suffocate. So the film's last scenes are of the "spirits" of her and her twin who go out of the water. So you mean to tell me in this movie, the bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: Imaging <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: music sound effects long and pronounced misdirection of plot low class appear from some not all actors
