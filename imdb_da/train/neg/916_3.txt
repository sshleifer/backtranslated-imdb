Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not give the right chemistry here in this film from 1945. There is a good story here that the axis is trying to get coal to use for the coming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not underlined. Instead, we deal with an apparently bungling Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real actress goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in 1943, the Oscar winner, "For whom Bell Tolls", Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary, but this time she is a double crossing spy for the pro-Franco group. She is quite vicious here, especially when she throws a 14 year old child out the window. She thought Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
