Remember not to waste +/- 2 hours in your life on this movie - just don't do it. Especially if someone is lucky to be snoozing next to you. Damn kind if you ask me. I waited for something to happen - it never did. I'm not one of those people who stop watching a movie part. I always have to see it through to the end. What a big mistake. Do yourself a favor and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - much more entertaining. Don't waste +/- 2 hours in your life on this movie - just don't.
