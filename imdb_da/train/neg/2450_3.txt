I looked at the Peter Jackson version of the ringmaster when I was halfway through reading the two towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this time, the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DvD but I told myself that I would finish reading the two towers and back of kings before I saw it (which I thought it showed the whole trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy I went and brought DvD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> I was boring for 20 minutes for what was really strange because I love the book and I shake that the maker of this movie could even think of fitting at least 1 and a half books into a 2 hour 8 minute movie. None of the characters had any emotion when they spoke, and they seemed to read it by a page, even my favorite character, who is Gandalf, did not seem interesting at all. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only okay in parts of the movie except the orcs (the so horrible) and the Aragorn and the Sam face. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie was released because there wasn't even a good ending, but maybe it was good that the producer ran out of money because the movie couldn't get any better. <br /> <br /> I just hope no one judges the books in this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
