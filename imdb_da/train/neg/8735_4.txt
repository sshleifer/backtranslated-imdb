This movie kind of let me down. It seemed very much like the movie jaws when the jumper told the mayor to close parks, as was when Roy Shider told the mayor to close beaches. They both said no way its summer! But the box says that Hopper must get into a killer and think like one. But he really does nothing too interesting or exciting. I am not even convinced that he and his partner have any experience in doing the police when they are in the office, wondering how to solve this case. They just say, let's do the police and we fix it. And what's with all the old men with pool cues. I didn't even believe they were bullies. And then the guy who doubted the guy was picking up the mob to find the killer. With his one hundred dollar haircut and that he believes his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on which cruddy lines. I thought he would beat him with a baseball bat like the other movies. I got this movie used and wouldn't buy the new one. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was fun watching the microphone over the stage where the jumper goes out to get coffee.
