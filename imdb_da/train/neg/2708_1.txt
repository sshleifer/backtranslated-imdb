This film masks as a social comment when it is actually as ridiculous as the much racism it condemns. Prerequisite for this movie: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun at Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy, stereotypically, crumbles in fear and begins to ask for his life ... but the great, strong, faithful Omar Epps stand strong without fear. We also have the condemnation of every brotherhood as an arrogant preppie drunk or raped. Of course, the raped white girl begins to consider lesbianism as she is just a weak white girl. Of course, when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the brothers, he must fall into the skinheads, who are incredible figs; especially the big muscular guy who is quickly knocked down by the strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE ??? Yes right. <br /> <br /> Of course, the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps easily enters them. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens their white roommates and queues them are just stupid - of course he is the dominant, while his weak white roommates are in fear of him and eventually move out. This movie was just awful and the end made me laugh a lot. The too-long slow motion between Epps and Banks becomes fun with the faces they make - it's like seeing my nephew and cousins ​​face each other (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
