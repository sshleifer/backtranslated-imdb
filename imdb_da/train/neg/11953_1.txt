Do you know the movies that have caught you in the cinema? You are stuck in the best seat in the house, in the middle of the row in your own special sweet plate, which you changed three times before you just got the right seat - and what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy , thinking "When F *** is this movie ever going to END ???" (You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q delivers a weird variant of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes and wondered when to start the case! It's endless! So "Arty" it hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I've seen. Apparently, he makes movies of dozens, and if they are all pretentious like this, I suppose it will be the last. I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is up there among the top 10 directors for me, but visitor Q is cut, cheap and scary pretentious w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you may have been working on now - I hated it.
