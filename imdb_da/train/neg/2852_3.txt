This is a thoroughly uncomfortable if it is beautifully made, movie. I tried it because it originates Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is being released from a mental institution - sounded promising. The movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should excuse the pun - from weaker and elegant people, if it is something surreal, interior, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of anatomy is avoided, it seems), while displaying a vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which are supposed to be humorous in some kind of postmodern way. Goldblum's whole-movie dialogue could fit on a 3x5 card and he has a single facial expression - a sardonic laugh - all the time. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds makes a cameo. The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I missed them somehow (good movement on their part). It's all cold, sterile, mechanical and unlucky; a legacy, I suppose it is 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers'. If you liked them, you'll probably like this.
