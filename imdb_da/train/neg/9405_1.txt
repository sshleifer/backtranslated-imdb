I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed to be from Melbourne, where the movie was made. Diabolical plays, amateur makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack. As for the plot, yes, it's even more stupid! Some of the scenes just left me stunned about how bad it was. There is a reason they put these types of movies on sennat tv - because they are completely rubbish! Avoid at all costs.
