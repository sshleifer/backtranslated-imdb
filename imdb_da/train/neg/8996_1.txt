In the future 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman holds hearings on TV's first uncensored network. They try it is programming that plays like a series of sketches. I can mention the good shit movies on one side and not use my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Importance of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video". Notice how I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this 'movie' is dead in film form. None of the sketches are even extremely funny, or even the smallest bit clever. It requires a kind of great tenure on the part of the filmmakers not even having one laugh at me. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn goes full frontal
