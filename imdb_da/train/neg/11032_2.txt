"I Love New York" is another recording of VH-1 (MTV Networks) that shows the entertaining side of dating a shrill, unpleasant woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the most wild, ebony-speaking, craziest competitor - and her mother - to give them a show on this network. Many will argue that "this is a show". It's true, it's not as bad as it was in the past, "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. It reminds me of a shit from the 90's "In Living Color" where Keenan Ivory Wayan's fake boxer Mike Tyson on the "The Love Connection" dating show and he chose "Robin Givens" for a date. Mike talked about how the date was okay, but how the unpleasant mother stopped. This show reminds me. <br /> <br /> The men are chosen and named to break down themselves and the woman they date more - (I think an intelligent man looks so far an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name, There is such a ghetto that you will annoy yourself every time you watch TV. But these are professional reality actors, so why bother. <br /> <br /> It escapes me to discover what's so entertaining about all this. The fact that this is as false as her newly implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (Well, you can't hate them for trying to make money). Maybe the wonder - who would like to be with this woman in an hour? Or ask if she and her mother's next show will be on the WWF! Any way you cut it, it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before, so now the shock value is down. No twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wagon, or anything other than any of the others. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those who call an "end" to reality exhibits, this is just another nail in the coffin, so they should end up immediately.
