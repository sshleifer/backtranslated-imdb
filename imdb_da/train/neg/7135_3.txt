I'm sorry to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that an Enzo could really follow a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power of the weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great. S7 has a power: weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp, while Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The low end of the S7 is also much better. Sorry Ferrari fans, but Saleen just gets that much better. <br /> <br /> As with other parts of this movie, I just have to say it's so substandard that it's pathetic. The story is too weak. The action of this lemon is worse than daytime lime. <br /> <br /> I can say that as far as a dissertation on negative psychology is concerned, it's a kind of gem. This film is nothing but a sharp definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. It is about these rich punks that knock out their rocks while only showing traces of celebrated remorse for all innocent road users, causing harm or death. <br /> <br /> I can't give the movie a "1 star" rating because it didn't force me to actually go out of the theater. I also think having a stunningly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes, as the leading woman saves it from being absolutely scary ... even though it's not possible, her song would put her on the cover of 'Variety'. <br /> ps: The guy playing Jason is the SOOOOO ski version of James Vanderbeek.
