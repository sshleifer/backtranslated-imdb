"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It is a movie that is loved by mothers, grandmothers and shut-ins going to the cinema every five years. Like a zombie movie, it blows. There is not a bullring in sight, and it is terrible light in the gorse department. "Zombie 3" on the other hand is great on shambling equal and quite generous with its blood spill - therefore it is better than "Gone With The Wind". Nor is it overstated. Most reviewers are under no misconception that it is bad. However, it is not boring waste. When a terrorist steals a virus, he escapes while pursuing a helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist who has been exposed to the unpleasant collision is hiding in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a carnivorous zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. When she is bitten, Lucio Fulci's fire in hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci-flick, the play is horrific, the storylin has gone with plot holes, and gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so it explains its rather schizophrenic character. It's badly shot too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Nevertheless, it is rescued by its joyous adherence to the most rich murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if you are an undead complete. Or don't like "Gone With the Wind", no doubt the worst zombie movie all the time.
