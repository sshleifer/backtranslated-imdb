Generally over rated movies that boast a strong cast and some clever dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost does it for her with her responses to Cage's changing accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settle for its role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than a real person, and that's what is needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance issues in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage continues to take these roles, perhaps because he likes those kinds of movies, but his own actor energy does not leak to them, even though he has been better off with repeated attempts. He should leave these types of roles to less interesting actors who will fully commit to the film and use their energy and great talent in more off beat roles and movies where he can be his crazy interesting self.
