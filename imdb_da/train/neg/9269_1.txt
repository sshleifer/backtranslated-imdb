Well since seeing parts 1 to 3 I can honestly say that they should never have made part 4. Everything from the sticky and I do mean sticky score to the really bad play I dare somebody see this and not get bored of their mind. I think parts 1 to 3 kept the mood strong on the plot of Damion, but without him in this, it's just not the same. Safe at the end of Part 3, I was a little tired of the continued story line, but it was a good closing at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for a part 4. Although it was possible, they could have done a much better job than what I had to go through, lol. There are one and a half and a half of my life, I never see again.
