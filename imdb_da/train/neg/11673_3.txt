1. Watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The fair lame account of the Titanic disaster is the first movie version of this much-occurring event. The replication of the disaster is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes stupid, badly acted and too soap-like. The story is much the same as the latest Oscar winning, except that we show how the crew tried to hide the actual catastrophe that occurred until almost late. Only for nostalgic goals and for getting a feel for what James Cameron competed against (barely) in his recreation.
