Tierney is an authentic hard guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO submits his influence to each turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson on a Ten Cmmments dinner. Just count the times that Tierney's incredible car mates swallow a lama excuse after another for their elusive and violent acts. The old clich√© whether it "only happens in the movies" applies here in spades. Then there is the guy who plays the guard who seems to have walked in from a comedy by WC Fields that destroys the threatening mood of the process. The static sets of sets also do not help, nor does Director Feist obviously lack the feeling for the material. Then add a last car deal that lacks both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact, the film only records in the scenes of the station, where hard-bitten police discover the hidden forces of innocent gas station residents. Too bad that Tieney's career never really ran out. I gather that was largely due to being as big a hard guy off-screen as on and getting in a sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold way and clear feelings remind me of Lee Marvin's best man at times. Yet this project may have acted as a radio game, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it is a disappointment.
