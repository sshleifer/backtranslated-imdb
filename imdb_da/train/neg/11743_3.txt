I really can't say anything bad * or * good about this thing. Its figures are well-suited enough, it is capable of producing and designed and professional looks (except for the cheesy monster clothes). However, it has no originality, no ideas and nothing you have not seen in Alien, Predator, Armageddon and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formal, cookie-cutter, "grimy corporate drones in deep space against unstoppable monster" flick. Almost a waste of time.
