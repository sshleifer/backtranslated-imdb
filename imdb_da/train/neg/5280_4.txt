Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser who works on the school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin from the horrible sugary "Step by Step" show of the now happily interrupted ABC's TGIF lineup) finds out that he is just inherited a porn empire from her biological parents. He is delighted with what true friendship and love is, and blah blah any other nonsense. He also has to fight with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer (or not)? A slightly below average teenage comedy stealing from better teenage comedies (the opening alone is HIGH American Pie-esquire) bends you upside down with morale, every chance it gets, and wastes the only star talent it has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I really stretch the star's words, Martin Starr from "Freaks and Geeks" Justin Berfield of "Malcolm in the middle"). It is not badly accurate, but it is far from good. Eye Candy: a few extras get topless <br /> <br /> My character: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until September 29)
