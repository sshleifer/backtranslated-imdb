Once again I took a chance and rented this bag by crap. Billed as a horror flick there was not a scene, not one that was even remote scarey. NOT ONE !! Sure there was some nudity, but all the lesbian actions were a bit old. Perhaps it could be assumed to be the saving grace of this film? And Dan, what an annoying ass bag !! Right from the beginning I knew I was in favor of it, as it was good when Dan first spoke. And he was supposed to be scary? What a laugh !! All in all, this movie is terribly horrible! How the hell do movies get this done? If you want a movie with a few tensions in it, don't rent it. This movie is about as exciting as Teletubbies.
