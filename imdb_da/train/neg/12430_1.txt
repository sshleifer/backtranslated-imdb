Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's the cream of the cream, or so if you tend to be more cynical as it reaches (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than the two, as the two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This has just made me hug in pain all the time and pat when the credits began to roll. No other movie has made me hug in pain. Now I want to point out why this movie is so incredibly horrible. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It's about a chip in a remote control car (?!) That is incorrectly located and how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. The action that follows is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and all, but looking at these boobytraps being executed is rather than fun, incredibly uncomfortable to see. I didn't laugh (or even as much as smile) once, rather I constantly cringed and hoped the terrorists would nail the baby. The bird, rather than giving comic relief, was eerie and annoying. <br /> <br /> The action, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to terrible. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is completely unlikeable and unfunny as the child, while the terrorists (and judging by their movie credits) look like they have been quickly picked up from the street ... and that's it. <br /> <br /> I can see some people say, "Man, it's for the kids. Don't let it be, man." Well MAN, kids like this, but they can get a hell better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting it out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - see the reviews for more) are better than this! <br /> <br /> In short, this is an irresemably cruel movie. This was clearly reused for the money, as it almost completely torn off the first two; The only thing is, it is also completely offended by the first two. No human, child or anything else should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
