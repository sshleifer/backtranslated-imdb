What a great pile of fertilizer. Shot-on video (REAL crappy video camera, NOT digital) pile of waste. It is undoubtedly the stupid thing ever made. The fact that this crap was actually released is entirely asanine. Anyone who sees it becomes stupid to have seen it. Seriously. I felt it killed several brain cells after I looked at this waste. The positive reviews of this a $$ crap were, of course, made by the "movie maker" (and I use the term VERY loose) myself and / or his family and friends because no normal person with intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life. Trust me, keep hell away from this video. You want to thank me for that. Avoid it as herpes.
