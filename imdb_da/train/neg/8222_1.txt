Um ... Okay, I suppose I get the whole shaky cam, gorilla movie technique, but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a complete mess from coming. Poor acting, poor conducting, poor history and horrible filmography. How this waste was released I will never know, but it has and unfortunately I have seen it. The movie in Tennessee directed by Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes", I suppose they should look like a "Blair Witch" type movie, but fall ... Okay the nose dives off a cliff. I was actually embarrassed by these young women, which I was definitely promised Hollywood star, but ended up in this deep-seated. The dialogue is ridiculous and actually aggravates you while listening to it. What this should be like a horror-flick is another mystery, as there is nothing even far-frightening about it, except for the fact that I saw it ... Try this for size: There are 5 of you and 1 of her, make the math and beat her ass ... "The end". Saddly it continued (and further) for 95 minutes of mind-numbing stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
