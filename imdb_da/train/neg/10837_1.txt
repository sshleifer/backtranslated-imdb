I can't tell you how angry I was after watching this movie. The characters are not the least bit interesting, and the plot is non-existent. So after waiting to see how these people's lives hit each other in the hope that the last 2 and a half hours led to some significant finish, what do we get ??? A storm of frogs. Well, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first and foremost, it was presented with absolutely no decision, and secondly, it would be lost to anyone who did not read the Bible (a significant part of the population ) or Charles Fort (an ever larger portion). As a slightly well-liked person, I thought that this movie was a bad mimic of a seinfeld episode. Do not waste your time. It would be better to read ... <br /> <br /> ... good to be honest
