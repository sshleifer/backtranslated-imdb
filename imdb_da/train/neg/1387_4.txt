It's hard to believe that an "action" packaged Jet Li movie could be so boring, but it was transcendent waste. The reason is a collection of other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks. The action of martial arts is all special effects and no human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a cartoon story of a group of superman soldiers who are to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of their number (Li) who holds an incompetent army back to save them and rebuilds a life that a pacifist librarian. The hidden kills resurrect with an Austin Power quality complex to take over the world, and Li throws his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed and it may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer-thin plot and comic book 25 cent special effects. But I suppose even the 8-year-olds would have found this juvenile and hollow Ninja Turtle watching.
