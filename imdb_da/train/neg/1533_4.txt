I will not spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add that because all the comments were so positive I felt I just had to let people know that not everyone is so enthusiastic, let alone intellectually induced by this attempt to create a captivating philosophical cinematic riddle. Some scenes seemed promising, playful with visual dimensions, but couldn't hold the rest. I felt like I was stoned for the first time and had semi-philosophical conversations with colleagues. <br /> <br /> What a careless attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. I'd rather see that Jesus is a Palestinian, without all pretensions and with straightforward humor, and also raises questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and prevailing will never be.
