One would expect a movie with a ca. The budget of 300,000,000 U $ D must at least entertain you for the time you spend at the cinema that currently sees it. "Matrix Reloaded" proves this assumption incorrect. <br /> <br /> "The Matrix" worked better, though there were visible gaps in the logic of the story. At least nobody could explain to me why beating a bot (aka agent) inside a simulation (aka martix) would harm the responsible computer program in any way ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers did exactly that "Agent bashing" is the most important thing in the "Matrix Reloaded": it is a beat'em up o-rama. This battle situation can be sufficient (or even cool) in 5 seconds. trailer, but prolonged for several minutes, apparently fake, choreographed badly and repeated again and again it is no more than boring. Despite seeing the promised spectacular stunts there is nothing more than simple low quality, imaginative bashing already seen (or better not) in eg. Van Damme 'film'. The difference in post production (etherything is 5 times faster, the camera floats a lot and freezes on specific scenes, and this is repeated for at least 5 minutes) does not help here, all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of "martial arts". Besides these "battles", all players refuse to do what they are paid for: acting. <br /> <br /> What happens next to the fighting situations? Get the exception of the Hollywood routine. This oh-so-multicultural bunch of hippies sucked into "Waterworld" is reused as citizens of "Zion" (men's last city on earth), and on the Morpheus order they begin to dance, for it is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts. The naughty glowing clich√© of the Miss and the French, speaking to this "you ne sais quoi" silly accent, wasting their happiness because of a "liason d'amour", is boldly earned. After this (and unwanted fun) is the battle between Neo and the monstrous supporters of the 'frog' as it takes place in an Erroy Flynn as an enterieur, fortunately with many mideaval weapons for decoration. For Neo poses with whims, add only 2 stairs and many statues (to be destroyed, tossed upon evil guys and the like) and you get 5 more meaningless, boring mins. of this junk. <br /> <br /> What's left to expect? The usual merchandising hell. And "revolutions" that will happen or not - certainly without me.
