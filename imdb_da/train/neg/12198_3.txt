I grew up with the Beast Wars transformers, I wasn't very familiar with the original transformers, and now that I've seen the amazing movie, and now I've seen the older cartoon it's based on, I have to say I likes original cartoon and live action movie more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I don't like the BW characters, I just think characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me firmly convinced that he is a true commander, more than Optimus Primal. In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look at the internet! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the BW character seemed more like a humorous version of the more vicious version of him in the original series. In addition to what is cooler, robots in animals or robots change into vehicles and spaceships? Gimme the original Transformers any day over Beast Wars!
