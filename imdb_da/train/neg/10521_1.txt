This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half, it feels somewhere close to 4. I've never seen a movie movement so slow and so without a purpose. This is also a "horror" movie that takes a lot of time in daylight. My friend and I laughed a crazy amount of times as we probably had to be scared. <br /> <br /> All we want to know is why such a horrible movie was released in so many countries. It may not be so much in demand. The super model Nicole Petty has to stick to modeling because even though she is beautiful, she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is British and half the time she is American.
