This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian television stations to meet local content quotas. The script was really awful, and I am not surprised that the authors are the ones responsible for the worst Australian film in the latest memory, the honest Wally Norman. Nothing about this television series was fun - ever - not even mildly fun. It was just tired and bad and worst of all really thought it was fun. It was simply embarrassing to see. <br /> <br /> There's something very much about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review of a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there weren't many) and that's impossible. Or crazy. There is bread bread that is more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and if it comes out on DVD, remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional.
