Here, Potter encouraged admirers of her much better "Orlando", Potter here delivers a vehicle to herself in the worst way: she writes, manages, steals and actually collects the music, including a mawkish love song. The movie looks very much like a college or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are so fascinating to us as her. But Potter's character is so unsympathetic, as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikely, and the whole movie is an embarrassing look of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of tango. Maybe she might not have worked if she hadn't thrown herself. She just can't act if she's playing or not. Pretentious, over-ambitious, boring and stupid.
