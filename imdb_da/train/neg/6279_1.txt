No, <br /> <br /> In essence, you look at something that doesn't make sense. In order not to spoil the movie for people who actually want this, then look at the girl, I will explain the story. <br /> <br /> A normal everyday life today, women walking down a street, you find yourself driving in her own car. She follows her and many events take place during the time that includes her and her family. I made an account to comment on this movie, how horribly written this was. The action was great, the events were good, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could have been added to enormously and made into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the author tried to do by doing this, usually at the end of the movies, most of your questions get answers, but this movie you asked: What just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just gone for nothing. /> <br /> Spoiler Starts <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would enter our world and kill us. It was not elaborated on at all during the film, and you never know how it happened or why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the film. The protagonist should not have been the protagonist himself. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally draws it all out and runs away (her sister's boyfriend) should have been the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, threw it out just after ... don't waste your time. I really hope that nothing like this is made again.
