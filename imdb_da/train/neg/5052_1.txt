Plato is for the Vietnam War, when Rocky IV is for heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of an American Army Plot in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone that it is ridiculous. While most or all of the occurrences in Plato occurred during the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things that happen to a small group of men in such a short time (weeks), a terribly skewed image of the war. In Plato, all the Platons men see in a week or two: American soldiers killing civilians, US soldiers raping civilians, an American sergeant who m by friendly fire, 90% + killed or wounded in platon. For Stone to try to pass this movie, as the typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War Movies I would recommend that we were soldiers (the true story of the probably the worst fight for American soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
