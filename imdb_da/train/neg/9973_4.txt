"Problem Child" is one of the most beautiful films ever made. It's not the worst (although some people will disagree with me on that), but it's not the best either. It's about a devil's 7-year-old boy who destroys comic chaos on a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who stupidly adopts him. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I do not buy in a second that a child could act as unrurly as the child does in this movie. It's asinine and preposterous even though I laughed several times through (I really don't know why). But I can't recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind to it. If there is a positive thing about "Problem Child" it is that it is better than the sequel, which was just terrible. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
