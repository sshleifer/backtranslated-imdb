There is almost nothing to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and can actually act, even though her role in this clunker is waste. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast ranges from poor to mediocre. In many movies this one shines through the material and you note them for future reference. Not so lucky here. Creature Unknown "a clich√©d monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids knocked off one after another. The monster is a man in a rubber boot that belongs to Paul Blaisdell's days. Bad, it is bad, a little humor could have made this more tasty, but everyone plays the deadly boring material right up, there is a twist or two at the end, but in that case you don't break any more.
