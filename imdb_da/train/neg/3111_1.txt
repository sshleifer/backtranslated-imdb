I would have rated this movie a minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why I didn't go out in the first five minutes of this movie I can't say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately !! Unfortunately, more people in our theater did not do them. <br /> <br /> History lacked all criteria for a movie. No reason. Awful play! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I can never see another movie he is in. Not a single story in history went over parliaments. I liked the tazer scene. It was too bad that it didn't come across any meat in the plot's meaninglessness. Someone needs to tazer the author and director of this movie!
