Italian horror / thrilling film about a wealthy English gentleman who crosses pubs and taverns for girls with red hair like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know he has really loved his wife because he brings them to his home - a great rotting castle - and makes them endure and then torture them, whip them, and kill them. The most bizarre aspect of this movie for me was that somehow at the end of the movie, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the movie's hero. In any case, soon under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera, you set off with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She goes in and weird things start to happen to the Deaf's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, just look at the title if you are still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashion. Poor Aunt Agatha (she seems to be perhaps even younger than you, and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy way. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a whole explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some things pretty well: The settings in the movie are suitable for this movie, but trying to make us believe that England is ridiculous at best. None of the actors see English. Many have dark black hair and Mediterranean complexes and wearing clothes an Englishman would not get caught in. The cars are driving on their wrong side of the road. But all that, however, the crypt scene was effectively shot and I also liked the cheese solution. And of course, any movie with the sultry, red-haired Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a lot of sexual perversion; however, as I found something appalling about the idea of ​​torturing women was pretty okay and healthy to relieve one of his mental demons. C'mon.
