I have tried to see this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s Show", I do not find much except for a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the 70s - the decade where I grew up . Of the episodes I have seen, most of the plots and jokes could be set for any period. Take away the news of (supposedly) set in the 70s and the show is neither interesting nor fun. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in America in the 70's, in my humble opinion, you can't do better than "The Wonder Years."
