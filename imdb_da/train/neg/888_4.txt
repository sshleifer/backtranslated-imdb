This was a movie I couldn't wait to see! So I finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. Initially, the film has said so little about New York, just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It's really not focused on the New York magic. Another thing that changed me was the French movie set in this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style remake! Anyway, here you will notice elements that remind you of French movies, like long and messy scenes, no or little talk and of course everyone is smoking French style! The story follows many lives (too many to my liking), and they somehow work connected. I feel that there was no dedication to the characters as much as the stories were. The film was too short to cover every fate, everyone is happy. So we can see about 30 people in about 5 minutes each. And there you have 120 minutes! if you like active scenes dialogues and things this is not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the cast!
