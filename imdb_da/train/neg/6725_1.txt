What could have been an engaging and emotional character study is completely undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard-trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra until his struggle with schizophrenia drives him into the street and eventually slides the row. Looking for a good story to increase his flagship career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert "rehab" Downey} learns to know him and tells his story. With every element of the classic "how we hit the skids" films, we are very liberally lent from "A Beautiful Mind" and take the false attitude to movies like "Rocky" - you choose the sequel number - and also whisper the 1930s style The melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie. It is corny, trite, completely predictable and plays too often on our feelings. I hate to say that, but it's that kind of movie, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can't. The actor solves it a little, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. Strictly speaking for TV movie stuff. Not worth your time.
