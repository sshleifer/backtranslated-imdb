This film is defective on many fronts. Like many before, it depicts more of Alamo's mythology than history. Production is poor, which generally gives the impression of a welfare project for many players who might have worked on Hollywood Squares. This for me was the biggest mistake - I know the age and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of television actors chosen to portray them, never disturb any suggestion of credibility. <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about the story. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but it never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Waynes or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this solid root, while they were only slightly less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it.
