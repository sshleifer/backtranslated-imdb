Moron and girlfriend perform some rituals to revive the dead in an attempt to prove that the dead cannot be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they revive a dead soul who begins to chop them with an ax, and the next day some college's old people tell the story of a bonfire. The guy with the donkey looks up and starts chopping the idiots telling the story. The group calls the police, the policeman sees the blood splattering all the time and thinks it is a mountain lion (!?), And shortly after, it is combed by some deformed murderers who may be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moronic small splatter movie filmed in broad daylight, but with more characters carrying lights and talking as if it were in the middle of the night and wanting to send a signal flare to attract attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other, but does not interfere with loading it, so after he finally reads it, he has several options to shoot the killer but does not interfere because it would end up in the movie for early. Then he throws the gun away! Also harmful are signs that do not show any feeling and look especially worried after their friends are chopped up and miserable effects (the human heart resembles a piece of chicken meat, the car blew up at the end was clearly a model car) and horrible dialogue And some really ugly female nudity doesn't help. And finally, it tries to get away with the incoherent by saying that it was the whole invention of the same college that were older people who tell camp car stories at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> Then the killer is ready to be right in the last scene that breaks them down. Again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre of it is sweet, just for some unintentional laughs. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
