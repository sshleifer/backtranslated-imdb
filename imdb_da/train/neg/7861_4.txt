The prerequisite for this awaited successor was really good, and after the great success of the remake, I expected very sincerely. The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and unfortunate. The situations are stupid and unreasonable, and the play is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no similar signs or violins as opposed to remake. Gore is not so abundant, and when it does, it's really bad. Violence is minimal and it is a shame because there are many arguments that make you believe there is room for great violence. I think there is a SWAT team seeking a family of cannibal mutants. You probably expect something different! When I watched it on film, I wanted the money back. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a clear example of how disturbed movies turn out to be a mess and show poor quality on all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess that dropped the tabs of remake like me. Therefore, successors are never welcomed; At least this movie is not as horrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
