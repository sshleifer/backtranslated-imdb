I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson who thought they were companions. They are, but Busey is in the opening scene, so does not show up until 40 minutes in the movie. Although every scene he is in is amazing. Especially when he pamperes himself as a blind oboe. What's amazing about this movie is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson is trying to find out who is stalking and killing telephony operators. At one point I think it's Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partially right. Busey is not the killer, but he calls and harasses the women over the phone. Why? I do not know. He is in no way connected to the killer, he just does it for kicks, I think.
