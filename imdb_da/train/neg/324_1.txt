Worst mistake in my life. <br /> <br /> I picked this movie up on Target for $ 5 because I figured "Hey, it's Sandler, I can get a little cheap laugh". I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three of my friends slept and I was still suffering. Worst plot, worst script, worst movie I've ever seen. I would turn my head up against a wall for an hour, then I would stop and you know why? Because it felt unfortunate. By bashing my head in, I stuck the damned movie in the microwave and saw it burning .... and it felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill just to get over that shit. I hate you SANDER for actually going through with this and renting a whole day in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
