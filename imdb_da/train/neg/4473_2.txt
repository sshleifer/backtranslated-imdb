Danes try to hard and are too extreme with all their shouts and become crazy, wasting water on themselves and rolling on the floor. Too much. Roll down, get together and let's laugh. I didn't really understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because there are both on stage or something? He said every comedian would be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really in it when he lived. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke, where people shout at the drive thru. I also liked Reese's Pieces joke. If the Dane just didn't act so mentally, he could be more fun, and I could have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.
