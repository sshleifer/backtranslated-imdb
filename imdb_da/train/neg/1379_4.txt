Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some biased violence. I wouldn't say the blood was soaked; But there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has a quirky customizable on-screen presence, but he has a terrible track record to be chosen for the parts he is following. There is always a producer's nephew or apparently trivial reason why he is not assigned the role he is seeking. Well, the best thing is to get rid of the competition ... Max gets obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shoot away. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, it's show business ... or is it?
