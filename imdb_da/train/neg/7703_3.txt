A famous showmaster enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the female killer is Sawa. She still goes to school and works for an evil criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day, Sawa finds himself killing his parents. <br /> <br /> ------ Even the biggest anime fans have to admit that this evil action thriller is a disappointing gore party. "Kite" has style, but it's still the trash. The weird plot of a teenage girl killing people like an assassin tried to be frightening and touching at the same time, and only causing the story to fall flat on the face. One of the highlights is an action sequence where the good / bad heroine Sawa coincides with a bodyguard of a building, but the dramatic structure is not so well orchestrated, and the strange and grotesque animation of character faces by director Yasoumi Umetsu is terrible. Not only that, the intercourse sequences are simply unsafe. <br /> <br /> Degree: 3/10
