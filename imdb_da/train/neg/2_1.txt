I saw the capsule comment said "great play." In my opinion, it is two good actors who give terrible performances, and with zero chemistry with each other, to a good director in his all-time worst efforts. Robert De Niro must be the most ingenious and insightful illiteracy of all time. Jane Fonda's performance runs uncomfortably across the map, as she obviously has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too quick an adjective for this movie's outrageous pacing. Although the film's intention is to be an uplifting story of hardening illiteracy, it is a true "bummer". I give it 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 movies to the budget level I've ever seen.
