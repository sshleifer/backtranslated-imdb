(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I should count. The DVD did not even show time or how long it was. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I had ever seen. This is much worse. Makes no sense. Collapsed plot. Everything then we can see oversized breasts on a figure that does not support them. <br /> <br /> It had to be a student movie. It must have got a C class <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out that it wouldn't end. ) Ending made no sensation <br /> <br /> Replayable: 0/10
