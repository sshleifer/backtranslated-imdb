Although it has been 2 years, I can still remember the complete waste that includes the whole plot of the movie. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I chose it while reviewing the new releases at Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie because it was the only one we had not all seen, and it sounded like it could be fun. Although it has been some time since I watched the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously there is no true plot) and it is a complete waste of time spent watching the movie. If you are in the video store and this movie catches your eye, go ahead and find a better movie. If you end up watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
