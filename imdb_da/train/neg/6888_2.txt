This movie is poorly understood, badly acted and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same Neapolitan Dynamite routine. Self-obsessed and ignorant. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same manic, excessively obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about her children's lives (see because I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I generally like her, also plays a vapid idiot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is acceptable but nothing special. <br /> <br /> You can skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
