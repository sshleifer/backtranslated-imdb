About 20 minutes in this movie I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were pretty boring. Occasionally, something funny would happen, but then things would go slowly again. Luckily, my patience was eventually rewarded and the end of this movie was not bad at all. But it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes. So I would say the movie was mediocre, and considering all the talent in the cast, I would call this a disappointment.
