Warning Spoiler. . . I agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie about such a true story. It had such a promise, but at best it was ridiculous. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something out of an amusement park. I found myself laughing as I looked at what was to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The best part was the battle between friends who ended up with "King" dying. I liked Queens' punishment. And the final shot, however, made a beautiful picture. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
