I have found the movie offensive for Americans who lost someone in the towers, for American people in general. Presenting to be a tribute to horrible facts that happened last year, each director gives the opportunity to polemize with ancient facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack) or criticize US political behavior or compare different political conditions they have in their own countries that have nothing to do or share with the horror on September 11th. Shame on them.
