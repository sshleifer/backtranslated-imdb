I saw most of the episodes of RMFTM as a teenager at the "Cliffhanger Theater", which ran after midnight at a local station a few years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater ripped it off in the early 90s. Time has not been good for it. <br /> <br /> I can certainly make allowances for the special effects that were quite impressive for a low budget 50s (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman in his TV show). And I can also make allowances for ahem, "acting" and combat choreography -. except the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He's incredibly miscast. He looks and seems like the guy who will fix your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of a foreign race. Even the corny dialogue seems okay - all rattles out of their lines as strings of firecrackers, without wasted time or breaks for things like "thought" or "introspection". As everyone does this, the viewer finds it profoundly after a while, and even in my modern feelings it is not annoying. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is writing and plotting. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking powder rocket ships or a flying suit that has controls marked "up / down" and "fast / slow". I am not even bothered by the cheesiness of the decisions for cliffhangers ending each chapter. I am talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are stupid than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And by the fact that even though the dialogue merges as an express train, the plot goes through the same movements over and over again. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando Cody and his friend are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab responsible for protecting the Earth (or at least the United States) from a creeping alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They didn't even lock on the front doors. So the villains go RIGHT IN and turn crap out of Cody and his staff ... not even (perhaps understandably) but several times. They even kidnap their female assistant on the second attempt. And they never become clever. To further prove my point, let me point out how Cody jumps into his flying suit and flies around in trouble and never seems to succeed in catching anyone. He does it again and again. Cody also flies his ship to the moon (the woman's assistant comes together to cook), remains for approx. 30 seconds and immediately turns and returns. Cody catches one of the Atomic Ray guns ... and immediately loses it to the evil guys because he couldn't bother unlocking it. Etc. And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so crucial to saving the US from the Moon Men, he might have asked for a pair of carbines, a pair of helicopters and a tank or two to back him up, rather than just work with the local police all the time. This should be a military operation, but they seem to be another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> It's all pretty hard to stomach. I appreciate the fact that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their history by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a relatively hard hombre (though he loses half of his fist fights). But I just can't help shouting "BY! LOCK THE DOOOOR !!" when the gangsters just go into his lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site in place ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> Still, it's okay. Of the three republican series I have seen, "Phantom Creeps" has had a better plot, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better whole than "Radar Men", but it is an ok time consuming. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why "Radar" men? They didn't use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Shouldn't the title have been "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
