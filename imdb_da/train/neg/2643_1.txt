This, for lack of a better expression, is the movie miserable. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This was perhaps the worst I've seen this year. It looked like the camera was thrown from camera man to camera man. Maybe they only had one camera. It gives you the feeling of being volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes, randomly thrown in without any continuity. When they did "split screen" it was absurd. Everything was flat, it looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were far away. These people must learn to balance a camera. This 'movie' is badly made and poorly done. <br /> <br /> Reason - You must be fooled. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the producers. looked like Marks Brothers with radios and weapons. Sutherland was in her '24' fashion - I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would have been better off with a little less and more. As an action bimbo, she wasn't much. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see a real plot, except Douglas, who bent the president's wife. Never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill pressure. I just can't see the US President running for his life in utility tunnels in a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-s-a-e. Hollywood is dead. This movie is the proof. I like 'the big screen'. Since I was a child. Many more 'movies' like this and I will stop going. What is the Hollywood case, made so many chick flicks, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start driving the old movies. One with real actors, good stories - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is a dog. Don't waste your time or money on it. I rate this 'movie' a zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can see over his age, but his just too much of a wimp to carry it from here.
