Christopher Durang must have been taught by a strange awful nun, because he just can't get rid of the concept. The game "Sister Mary Ignatius explains everything to you" was presented - at least in Hollywood - in the same way as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a lampoon, a bitter satire of a peaceful confident, doctrinal, and highly judgmental nun - and played by Lynn Redgrave was her fun. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration seriously - while, as mentioned, we keep the same tone in "explaining it all" scenes. The two approaches collide slowly, and in the last twenty minutes the film goes out of the track, falls into the gap and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked if the scene's tone with the four former students and their meeting with Sister Mary had become the same as the sister Mary scenes. Or if Sister Maria's scenes have been presented more realistically. This way simply doesn't work at all.
