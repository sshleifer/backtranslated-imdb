I buy or at least watch all Seagall movies. He came out with a handful of good movies and fell into bad stories, bad camera work and a walk-through persona, he almost lost me. A few movies since he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he's forgotten again. This movie is seriously dark (at any level you usually name). There are lots of slashes and gash going on here without any visible purpose unless it is meant as a warning to the military. Seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scenes, as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody and continued to increase the destruction everywhere. Okay since when do we put an armed guard in the living room with a prisoner? Still, this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused. There are lots of things to do if you like the king of things. It seemed to me that the bad guys beat the same gash every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their unhappy victims. I get you back to my resume. Basically, it's a horror movie disguised as an action movie.Dec 6,2006
