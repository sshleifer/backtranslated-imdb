Now I have to say that this movie was so bad that I would have gone out if I didn't have to go through it for work. And the worst part is, I would see it so badly that I was driving across the city, paying $ 10 parking twice, because newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I've seen him play another was in the movie with John Travolta. Still, the plot has potential - it sounded good in the preview, but it's full of ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turning points. And I hoped this would be a Christmas movie where Christmas didn't have to be saved and Santa didn't need a replacement but no. The only cool part was the sled ride, and the little pet was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids, but for adults, it's so funny that it's fun to sit through.
