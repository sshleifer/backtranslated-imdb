I have seen many, many films from China and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was 'Unknown Pleasures'. I saw "Platform" last night and thought that Jia Zhang Ke's two other films should be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. I don't want to see 'Xiao Wu' tonight tonight because I've just put all three movies in the box! Anyone who gave this movie, 'Platform' ten out of ten, should see more cinema! The shooting was very poor: it was very difficult to distinguish between some of the characters due to the lack of close-up. The story was so uneven that I quickly sent it to the end out of sheer frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage some day. These are true gentlemen in Chinese cinema, not pretentious cow men!
