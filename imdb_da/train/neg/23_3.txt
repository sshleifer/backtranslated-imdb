I rented this on DVD without prior knowledge. I was suspicious when Michael Madsen appeared in a movie I never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. <br /> <br /> Well, I guess Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget that he has ever participated in such a shame of a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and dialogues are horrible, even good actors can't save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this movie. For many non-native English speakers, parts of native English speakers who read lines from a script should have been thrown away and not made into a movie. It's amazing how incredible all the lines in the movie sound. The music is horrible and out of place, and it all looks and sounds like a bad school game. <br /> <br /> I recommend you just watch it so you will appreciate other better movies. That's why I gave it a 3 instead of the one it deserves.
