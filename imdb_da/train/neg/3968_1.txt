If you've ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compare it with the feedbacks it gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and voices are fake. TRUST ME: You will be bored! People in the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: they also click constantly "no" when there is a negative comment on the movie. Therefore, negative critics are always behind the hyped. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, poor lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley can be a good businessman. Otherwise, it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his films. (Okay, they're cheap, but nonetheless.) But as a creative person, he's a complete failure.
