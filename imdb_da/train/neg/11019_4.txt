Fred Olen Ray is a miserable instructor, as far as B-movie directors go, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his better films. Yes, it does butcher the great Poe story 'Early funeral' and yes, it is poorly paced and uneven throughout, but it is also quite entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than normal as a beautiful, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) plans to get rid of her because he needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early 90's soft core films, actually gives the best performance in the movie as a dull mistress. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a great como in one of the better scenes. The end didn't make much sense!
