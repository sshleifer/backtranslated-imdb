1. Watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The 3rd Universal Mummy Movie is about the same as the first two, as far as the final result from the viewers' perspective. The story is the same and the result is high. This time, the location of history is the United States, when the new supporter of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he can revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time, the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (who doesn't make much difference because he really isn't asked to do much for this sign). The new pastor becomes a tomorrow in the city and sends the mummy out to make his dirty deeds after feeding him with toothed leaf juice. Again a girl comes in the way when the pastor falls to one of the descendants' fianc√© and wants her, yes --- to be immortal with him (have we not heard it before?). Of course, the plan is counteracted as the city's people chase down the mummy with flashlights (similar to the Frankenstein monster) and the burning of creation ends the story ... how do they get a successor ?? I think you will find out with the next in the series ?? or not.....
