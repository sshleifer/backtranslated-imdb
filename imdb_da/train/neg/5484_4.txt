This movie is about a family trying to express their mother's / wife's death by moving to Genoa, Italy. The reason for "Genoa" sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes depicting the family's daily life, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of such scenes are redundant and tiring, totally incapable of engaging viewers emotionally. The end is very disappointing as it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored of "Genoa" The only good thing about the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genoa. "Genoa" can serve as an extended tourism ad to the city, but not as a movie to be enjoyed.
