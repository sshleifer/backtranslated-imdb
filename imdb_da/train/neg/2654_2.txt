Although the casting for this movie was admirable, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or instructor to make this movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we saw the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to turn away. It might have been that we "hoped" that the message would ultimately make itself clear and that we would be able to get a meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this has not happened. <br /> <br /> Of course, the public may have been able to "make sense" of this horrible tale, a credit to the human brain's ingenuity to make sense of the absurdity. However, the authors did nothing to ease this innate need, we seem to have to find meaning. It was evident that those involved simply went through the movements of their respective crafts and that any independent passion for the characters or story was either secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, television films have unfortunately proved to survive over the years. While the dissemination of a message to the public may have been the primary interest of the authors of the past, today's authors and producers seem to be discouraging for their audiences, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to "stop" through the incessant advertising that seems Being the only reason why movies like Surrender, Dorothy is made.
