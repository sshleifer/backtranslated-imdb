Oh man, this sucked suck .... I couldn't even get any camp value out of this ...... and I sat through the whole thing on Showtime .... Don't bother waiting for 'naked scenes either ... .. it is too late and only plastic Jenna Jameson is involved. Shows how much discretionary money should be around Hollywood just to get your name on the final credits. I think Showtime should throw something at 1 ... Next time I think I would even rather watch ESPN loop around every 30 minutes ...
