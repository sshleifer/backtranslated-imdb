I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I have read it to each of my 3rd and 5th grade during my last 18 years of education. Probably there had been a movie in the past, but I had never been able to find it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I had the highest hope. When the film went, I became more and more despondent. They had lumped it badly! Never had I been so disappointed with a preferred book-to-movie adaptation. I understand that movies can't hold onto a book, but they don't have to change things for that! Most, if not all, departures from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I kept my mind at the beginning and listened only to my students discussing the movie. Well, it wasn't just me. Almost every one felt the same way - cheated out of the great story, Madeline L'Engle had created so well! <br /> <br /> Why did they wonder, did Aunt Beast like Chewbacca from the starry movie? Why couldn't Calvin's hair be red? Why did Mrs, who doesn't have the right "witch-like" outfit, be such a smart game on her name? Basically, we all wondered - why should almost every detail change? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would do. I'm still waiting for that movie. This was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest sense. I'll write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the job!
