With a cast list like this, I expected far better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can't do anything very interesting when their plays are limited to falling asleep throughout the movie. The plot list says that a secret is revealed to the daughters when their mother comes closer to death. The thing is, she never tells her daughters anything but cryptic advice to be happy. All relations in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that back and forth between the past and the present was unnecessary. It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the Da Vinci code book, where the device was used to boost the voltage, or from the notebook, using the device to create the never-ending romance of the protagonists of history. Whatever it was a cheap entity in this movie, because it didn't seem to create anything. It was a way of trying excitement in a movie that has no one. I wondered why good movies cannot be written to women. It was really a disappointment.
