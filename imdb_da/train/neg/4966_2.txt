I understand that this movie was made on a very low budget, but it is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalks, the throne of fire, barbaric queen, conquest, the invincible barbarians were all done on shoestring budgets and bad special effects, but they still managed to create cult classics by adding some sharply dressed women warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles and the beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low-budget sword and Turkish movie, but the creators destroyed this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this movie to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how an entertaining low-cost sci-fi / adventure movie can be made using credible special effects and appealing characters.
