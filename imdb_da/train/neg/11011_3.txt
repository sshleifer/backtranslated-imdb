A series of painfully unfunny sketches that seem to go on forever and one day. Not as insane as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but it is by no means an endorsement in any way, meaning or form. Features the worst creepy ever. Anyone most if it is not offensive to anyone but the most prudish or politically correct. It also has the worst song parody, EVER added to the film, the WORST Arnold imitation EVER (not just the worst song in movies, literally the worst ever). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash wanted to star in this (the reasons I saw this in the first place). The only mild fun was Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but the people who make it their mission in life to get this at the bottom 250 of this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you living people. Plus, if that's true, the Scientology Church is researching him, he can't be all evil. <br /> <br /> My character: D
