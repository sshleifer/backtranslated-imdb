I think scarecrows are scary so it's a shame that this movie doesn't make more of them. <br /> <br /> A bunch of robbers make an emergency jump from a plane to a huge field of scarecrows. One of them disappears with the foliage and the rest shocks him as he is hit by unexplained vicious scarecrows. The actor is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive (when they move). On the positive side, the director gets some excitement out of the static scarecrowers. It's like Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb under a table goes off and it's surprising. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it will go out and it's excitement."
