This movie was horrible. I had a very difficult time seeing it all the way through. I didn't get the point with the movie. What was the meaning of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, acting was bad and the story uninspiring. The two main characters in the film were very boring, and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I don't know for a fact, but I suppose most of the actors were first timers. The film could easily be cut down to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. It indicates how many useless scenes were in the movie. I'd rather have a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want the two hours back! If you want to see good, fun movies that are family-friendly and made by a lot of Mormons, you should see Napoleon Dynamite instead.
