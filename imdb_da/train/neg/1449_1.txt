First you need to understand before I continue reading that I'm not neo-nazi, I'm just trying to understand that Hitler is sure no one like him is taking power again. <br /> <br /> I've seen this series and found it horrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to see, but is it right? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler would never abuse his daughter, in fact, it is very likely that Hitler was in fact gay and fought his entire life to choke this secret. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to come to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. It's a common point I found in interviews of people living near or far from him (of course, not Jews). This series was horrible because if you think Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong. If you believe it, you will let people like him take power in countries and you will not. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking that he was just awful, you could find dangerous politicians like him (of course remember that he was chosen) and stop the topic before it's too late. /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is just awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like that, another will take place exactly as the first one did.
