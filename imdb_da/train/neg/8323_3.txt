From the beginning, this movie had a few flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is the rich young mogul who has inherited his father's vast wealth and power, and he struggles to both fill his father's shoe and cut the disguise strings mother (and co-manager) hold too tight. He also has the problem of having a heart disease and waiting in the limbo, which is the organ donor register. There are also smaller back stories that your first instinct is to mostly ignore that becomes more important later, such as. His friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative story lines, but not bad enough to destroy the movie. The only real "oy vey!" moment was the name of Lena Ols's character. Indulgent woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that people who find surgical scenes may not be scary. The fear of being awake during anesthesia was done well in the beginning. You look in emotional pain when Christensen screams in through the chest cut and the rib spreader. The moment of irony from trailers then comes when he is one of the unfortunate few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also good luck because it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him. <br /> <br /> The big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the movie into the conspiracy and his memories of the little characters there, but he, like us, originally missed. <br /> <br /> There are two more phrases at the end that involve his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin, which comes as equally impressive due to poor writing. The other is a secret about the family's past, which seemed very dressed and meaningless. <br /> <br /> The initially well-done stunning drama is lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is a final attempt to bring it back, which falls flat and takes the whole movie with it.
