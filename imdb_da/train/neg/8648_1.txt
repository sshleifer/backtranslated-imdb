Well, basically the movie is blowing! It is Blair Witch who meets Sean Penn's ill-conceived imagination of coming to Iraq to show the world what the "war on terror" really is about. The scripture sounds like it was written by 8 degrees (no offense to the 8th grade); the two main actors hand over the whole movie; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of movie (not that I know anything about the things - but it just didn't look like real documentaries I have seen), and the worst of all Christian Johnson took a good idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a really bad stick figure that looked like something more like a giant dare. I'd rather see Blair Witch VIII than sit through again.
