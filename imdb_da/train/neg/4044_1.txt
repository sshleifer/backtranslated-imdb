From a plot and motion point of view, this movie was horrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater, hoping it would end and eased after 80 long minutes, as it mercifully did. Basically, five characters are seen in the film, a son and father, son's girlfriends, and two male characters in the sons' age, who appear and disappear without coherence or explanation. The movie and the scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the film, the sons' friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in a strange conversation. Photography and action lent an incredibly seductive effect to the interaction between the two, and ended up admitting to having another man who was "older". End of that story.
