Just a jason lee movie, there were some parts of the movie that were funny. Undertone on the go is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls look at slum parties. It was a really good movie. It's kind of one of the movies you have in the background and looking up now and then when something catches attention. I think Julia stiles and Selma Blair is a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. It's just a boy who meets girls' movies. This is the perfect movie they would show at Comedy Central. I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
