I first learned from Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's 'scared stories' books: According to this story, Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - draws you up into the sky and pulverizes you. It sounds like a beautiful unusual performance, Schwartz's history has made it a rather coherent idea. The movie "Wendigo" does not. It basically consists of all horror flick cliches: the family moves to new house and strange things begin to happen Anyone who damages them asks for it, and everyone had better listen to the old Indian guy, I've seen these things so many times that I no longer count. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey at "Malcolm in the Middle") have done far better than this.
