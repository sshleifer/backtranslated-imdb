Worst DCOM I've seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The story and story were fine, but the effects sucked! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fighting scene was between the brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene where I was excited. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie very boring and the kind of movie suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> I will give it a four to Brenda Song, a very fun actress and one combat scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
