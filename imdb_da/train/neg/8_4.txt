6/10 Works, not great, but some good actors. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director makes some stupid decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story makes no sense whatsoever and has many mistakes. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Total score for this movie. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 to this movie and it can be too much. Signs are as exaggerated as they can ever be, and some pretty inexplicable things happen historically, not in a good way. Because of the style this movie has been filmed, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shake and fast forward). It's always good that movies use music to make history smooth, but there are too many tracks in this. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
