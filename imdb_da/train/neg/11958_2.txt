Okay, so I'll get it. We must be horrified. The idea has been planted. A girl makes her father and takes pictures of it. Call me over the chokrock genre, but I urge an explicit detailed description of an action before I can fall for it. But don't expect me to see a soft porn and be horrified that she's doing her father ... I don't think the convention is being abused in the adult film industry that is already infiltrated with "rape and rape" porn. Horror is not what your mind can fool you into believing. That's what actually exists in movies. This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choice for your own adventure.
