I watched the entire film acknowledging the participation of William Hurts, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I had no idea about Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie I said "it was Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for a great performance. Weller played a great character and his performance was such that I didn't even recognize him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot was bad, the writing was poor, and the performance, except Nosbusch and Weller, was subpar. The scenery and setting was interesting, and Weller was great. 4 stars, of a possible 10.
