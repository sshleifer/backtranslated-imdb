<br /> <br /> I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came just after the first. For some reason, this film kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was cheeses how this guy got involved in the movie. In the first film he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequel half of the killings / experimental killings were basically without reason. Stanley killed the director because of creative differences, he caught the co-author because of creative differences, but what was it about trying to kill the role? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to "look right when they died"? If this should be such a high budget movie, use special effects, MAN. Of course, as the first, the captured girl comes away and Stanley ends up shaking up and disappearing. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I wanted to see a "Cabin at Lake 3". Only because I like Judd Nelson and he is the only good part about this sequal.
