This movie has made television smelly all over. Although it started with great intentions, with beautiful sets and authentic props and costumes. The movie quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose's cheesy dialogue and hurried into television melodramatic acting. The characters were so juicy that I sometimes thought they were about to degenerate into a cargo sausage of goo, and the action was so horrified and badly cut that it looked as if the soldiers just stood around and switched to shooting at each other . The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to see. The only thing the German officers were talking about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this. I'm a big fan of the war genre and this movie is crap. Nevertheless, this DVD has an excellent extra feature that covers letters from the WWI front line, making this rental not a complete waste of my time.
