The fact that this bad excuse for an amateur time-show test was hired at Sundance is a good example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days. First of all, there is something like the cinematography. Just downloading a 16mm camera and pointing to anyone has a line doesn't make a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we must be lucky enough that the director has not picked anyone's video camera ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film must be about real people. There is nothing right in this movie. None of the characters come across being even external. What they face as being are the characters of the imagination of an author trying to impress his friends by showing them how "cool and edgy" he is. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but writing or directing is not good. What is left is a shame of a bad movie that in its way has found its way to Sundance. It was hard to believe this was one of the best movies posted ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it made me lose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
