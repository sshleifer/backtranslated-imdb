How did it come to exist? I generally love sci F / Bigfoot regardless of movie etc. but I still expect them to be written without as much cheese as this. The effects were sad, the lines were sad. Avoid at all costs. I just ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson in it - still haven't seen it). The idea of ​​the movie is actually a good one. There was much potential to make a fantastic little movie here. I just don't understand how something like this ends up as such. Go to movie / art / English interested students in any high school and you will find people who can write a better script.
