This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be a good budget, it had the potential to be much better. It was almost. With the heroine pretty much like Salma Hayek, the hero fights almost like Jackie Chan, fights and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in, says Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just boring, and it's hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart from John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like the warriors in Hero or the aforementioned Crouching Tiger ... I'm really ashamed of poor old John. He is a really good actor and deserves much better. So like you - so if you still have a chance just see something else.
