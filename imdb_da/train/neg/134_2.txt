This movie in away was super-smart. It's theme rhymes with every horror movie ever made. Valentine makes NULL attempts to be original. What is Valentine anyway? It is a bunch of people who give each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once, and in one view here are some of the movies that were ripped off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie where someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my mind slowly became a silk plastic so it couldn't get hold of them as fast as they came. Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How does any horror movie have a "surprise" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute becomes a nice girl for an evil B - ch, then she is an insecure woman, etc. Usually, any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine does not have this. It was as if they were trying to make it PG-13 but failed so they left editing. <br /> <br /> Don't see this too inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
