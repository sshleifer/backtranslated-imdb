There are only two movies I would give 1/10 to, this stinks and "The Man Who Fell to Earth." I remember seeing a protocol at a theater in the early 80's when I was in high school. Scripture is insulting to any (including a high school) intelligence. It completely lost me with "hillarious" gag of someone who was shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn must be charming but come across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, followed by Goldie, who wins over all by spitting populist dribbles. The action was horrible, including Goldie Hawns. I couldn't stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she cashed in Everyone says I love you. This is the kind of movie you make if you don't want to put any effort into writing in acting. The worst.
