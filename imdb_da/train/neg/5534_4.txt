I work on my way through Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the films in the set. I see them with my soon-to-be-seven-year-old daughter, who makes most of these movies a ridiculous scream. I had great hopes for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES after seeing the White Zombie, who is really the forerunner of so much that it is the mainstay of zombies in the cinema (think Clive Barker's Serpent and the Rainbow and James Bond's Live and Let Die burial scene, NOT Night of Living Dead. <br /> <br /> But even though the title contains the word "zombies", it's a little more than a love triangle involving anthropologist Armand Louque merged with Claire Duval; again taken with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a barking party, my daughter fell halfway through. <br /> <br /> I had a really hard time deciphering who these people were working for - the Allies or Axis; but I don't really bother. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits for this movie; but of course his eyes (from the White Zombie) acted as mind-control units for the zombies.
