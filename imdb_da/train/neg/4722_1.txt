do not see this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda next to this documentary and you will see the facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> Death in Yugoslavian documentary series (of five episodes) is a carefully composed and studied account of the expanded mass bloodshed that marked the end of the old federal Yugoslavia and spanned almost the whole of the first half of the 1990s. It contains a wealth of news and interviews with involved parties both "Yugoslav" and otherwise. The only real "improvement" that could be made to this amazing achievement would be to include later developments in the Balkans since the program was made. This was actually done at the end of the 1990s for a repetition that showed on BBC TV, but the addition of some more recent events would help complete this admirable detailed and fulsome piece of work. Maybe another whole episode might be justified? The very clear title in this documentary was made more appropriate by the final abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by the said Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very delayed and formal admission of what happened years before. /> <br /> not fiction as in "Yugoslavia: The Avoidable War (1999)"
