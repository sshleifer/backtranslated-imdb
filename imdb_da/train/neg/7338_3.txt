I have seen this movie by hoping to find a beautiful and interesting story, but the story was not good at all. Actors' plays were no better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shahrukh Khan was still there, but he wasn't enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie was based on the novel Flaubert "Madame Bovary", but for me I didn't see the one who matched the Indian mentality. In general, we buy movies to dream and have a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood to worse. I just can't understand how it could get such a "high" voice with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So that's the kind of movie you have to run away and ignore because there's no is something to appreciate in it! You will just waste your time unless you like "dark film" with "strange and non sense story".
