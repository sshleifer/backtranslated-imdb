Recipe for one of the worst movies at all times: A woman's villain, similar to the escape from the WWF, has terribly aimed at a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy she shoots on fire, but when she shoots someone else they just disappear) and take time to grow a deer. Then you got the unlikely signs, 30-year-old college students, a lame attempt at a surprise ending and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
