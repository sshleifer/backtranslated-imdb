I admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, almost 30 years after the film's production and at the time of its view, it may have been a brilliant horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> Beginning on the Halloween night of 1968, 6-year-old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later he escapes and returns to his hometown to murder again. <br /> <br /> From this point it is clear that the film follows a basic and rudimentary road that is very predictable. The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it will end, while the music for each scene containing Michael (the killer) is exactly the same throughout the movie and thus warns the viewer of the likely events to follow. <br /> For the horror / thriller enthusiast, there is a serious lack of blood / gore compared to modern movies, although I am not related to the amount shown in this day and age. A happier medium could have been found. <br /> <br /> From half an hour into the movie, a scene is not unexpected. The act of a horror / thriller movie is quite typical of the era and therefore lacks any kind for the modern enthusiast. One positive for the movie is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting that create a frightening atmosphere. Another positive would be the character of Michael's doctor, which gives traces to the likelihood of where the story can lead. However, it is clear that the star of Jamie-Lee Curtis is in childhood stages of his acting career and thus fails to give a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to judge this movie as it was today, but from the other horror / thriller movies of the 80s and to a lesser extent the 90s it is far from a really big horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go ahead and find a classic from the 80s. Bowl!
