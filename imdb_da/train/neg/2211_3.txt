Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny - it sums this movie up in one word. What was this "thing" because it can kill me using the word movie!?!?! I hope the director, the author and the producer did not mean that this would prove to be good because it probably did not !!! A scientist turned his son into a hammerhead shark, and the shark killed a lot of people the scientist invited to the island !!! Oh my Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I looked at it, I laughed at all the serious parts because they were so corny and unprofessional .... and they couldn't have made the shark look more unrealistic, even though This "thing" had a slightly larger budget than most low budget films. All I have to say is to see that this movie expects to laugh at all the bad plays and stupid corny dialogue because if you expect a good movie, I will be very disappointed.
