Actor Ruth Roman's philanthropic philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving the Korean War on an air base near San Francisco, started this all-star Warner Bros greeting to patriotism and singing. Many celebrities create guest properties, while a love-hat art develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and shiny Air Force Corporal (Ron Hagerthy, resembling delivering newspapers from his bike). Seems that the corporal has fooled the actor into thinking he is out of battle when he is actually part of an airline crew member flying to and from Honolulu (you think she would be happy that he was out of the way of the injury, but instead she works like most childish women in the 1950s film). Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laughter and nice song numbers are most enjoyable. Roman is also here, looking glamorous, while James Cagney's heck of fun on his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman also sings in a hospital cover after Doris Day's management, which makes one wonder: "Were they out of sets?" For indispensable viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. Nevertheless, low interest rates and just enough technical aspects make "Starlift" strictly a second impression. * 1/2 from ****
