I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, but after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ..... but the first problem was that there really wasn't a story ... or was actually a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that there was no setup for these characters ... yes I understood that they all went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the movie you realized they had nothing else in common and did not like each other ... so why did they stick together. Error number 3 ... the director even though long pauses and tight camera pictures were excitement (especially with the typical excitement music being called in) ... unfortunately he was mistaken. It was painful to see a great actress like Amber Benson's wasting time trying to bring this back to life .... my only hope is that the money she made here was set to produce her own movie.
