I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh had to carry this awkward incredible script for five hours (or how long it actually was). From the beginning, every single element of this movie is incredible. This movie made me pat several times, but they were primarily out of shock that the director / writer actually expected us to believe in the many messy scattered items trying to share this movie together. <br /> <br /> The focus of the movie is Gray (Graham) and her intimacy issues. Things become interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly too much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, exciting. But instead of unraveling this story for something credible and tasty, the director continues to keep Gray in those ridiculous terms that never really make sense. Being an LGBT person, this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we are going through in the exit. (I'll be offended if the author's queer.) Had it not been for the sweet chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which by the way was understandably forced), I would give it a negative 3 stars.
