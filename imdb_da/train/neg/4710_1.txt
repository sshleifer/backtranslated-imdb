My brother is in love with this show, let's get it right. I totally agree with the people who said it was copying from Dexters Lab and quite strange parents. <br /> <br /> I have never really seen quite strange parents, I mean, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's actually annoying and not sweet at all. This is almost the same as I feel about Johnny Test. Except, nothing makes me laugh at that show. Gags are so stupid and meaningless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids can't dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is amazing, but c'Mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab used to be one of my favorite shows, and I still don't mind seeing it. Which makes me angry and ashamed of Johnny Test that makes an absolute JOKE out of the wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. The. Dog. Is. So. Annoying. He is more tall and uncomfortable than Johnny! And gay accent? What fudge! I hate the dog and I hope he dies because it would be better for children to watch than to listen and see the nasty shit that goes on in that show and get a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyes to burn in miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show, don't face it!
