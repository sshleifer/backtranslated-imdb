This movie is really bad. Maybe it's hard, but it is. It really is. Bad script, any vampire clich√© in the book is used, and no sympathy is given to the protagonist's origin ... ie. ole Dracula. There have been some really brilliant Dracula / vampire films in the past, but it doesn't even do that in the "dire" slot. Take a selection of people who seem to have fallen out of a teen slasher movement, add a dribbling of Dracula Lore and mix in a fierce tonic of religious / surreal daydreams ... and you get a confusing mess on a movie - Dracula 2000. I really can't find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller an English accent ... What's the problem with what I hear you cry ... Well, he's English, but he sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. All in all, you might as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it) or rent it out, see it and discover for yourself why it's as scary as Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
