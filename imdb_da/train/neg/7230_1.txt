I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines these three would be the least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: the story (or the lack thereof) was completely uninspired and lacking in imagination - while imagination is usually the greatest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and action is even worse than in an average porn movie. In particular, Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'poor performance'. Bad action would not have been such a big problem if only 'director' Bilal did not take himself so seriously; All the lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he has made a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry found in this piece of junk, only pretentious! This man should really hold onto making comics as he fails in all sorts of accounts as a director. Worst of all is the horrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it really shows that this movie becomes a physically painful experience. The graphics look so false that they even look like werewolves in 'Van Helsing' like live actors! And since half of the characters are CGI animated, it's quite a problem that the CGI effects look so fake. If Egyptian gods actually exist, Bilal is a dead guy as they will undoubtedly take cruel revenge on him for the ridiculous way he portrays them in this catastrophically bad movie.
