William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director / author credit for this entertaining low-budget three-boy movie playing in the woods with their horror journals. Feet bred by the fire and the school boy back and forth ... and a scroungy town tramp called Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface's fame) wanders over and trades four stories of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire. <br /> <br /> A story is the old retread of "The Hook", two teenagers on the lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hand hook. Another story has a few tokers who have to score some weeds. They stumble upon a guy who knows a guy who has some good s # @ t. As they smoke a few bags full, their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to die and enjoy telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth camp box narrative is a greedy sailor who washes ashore disturbed by an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out into the ocean by zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a huge budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES points get across and really could have been much worse. A little corny, but fun to watch except perhaps the sailor's tale. The action is understandably not assigned dignity. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
