I looked at 'Envy' two nights ago, on DVD, at a friend's house. The prerequisite for this movie is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with great potential, but it does not live. I saw it with about five friends and no one laughed at the whole movie. The jokes (which are few and far between) are not fun in any way ... The story is bad and they never answer the question ... WHERE SH * T GO? Of course, the answer is nothing. This movie lacks any kind of comedy value, and as a few other users have said, the only thing that makes it even nearly worth watching is Christopher Walken as a J man. None of the characters are developed, the plot is so thin it is almost transparent - and is the song in the whole movie presumably fun?
