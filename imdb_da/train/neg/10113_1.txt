I have discovered that this film is rented from the packaging. zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. Then you come to the movie and it is women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects ... and even combat scenes you can see them miss strokes by 2 meters. The funny thing is that Lommel appears in the film short and himself is worse than the rest of the actors in the film. The only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people are duplicating it to a "cult classic" ... but I can't imagine that this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. The real horror of this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed that I rented it and never promise to see another Lommel movie again!
