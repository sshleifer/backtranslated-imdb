The supernatural, avenged police officer is back for a third installment, this time as guardian angel for a mistakenly accused female policeman. Standard stalk and slash image, yet well-acted and straightened, making it oddly interesting and attentive, although the violence is not too squeamish (especially the director's cut, which was originally given an "NC-17" rating). <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
