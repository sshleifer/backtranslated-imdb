Exceptionally horrible tale that I can hardly put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims appeared at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is a chance that I missed some important record elements, as I might have been in a small coma during the time this baby was on. The box into which the movie enters shows scenes that are never in the movie. I was enticed by the raw pictures of slavery torture and promises of a "Euro-waste, sexy scary flick." I get the feeling that this was the budget version, and about a quarter of the movie was left out. All the good things more than likely. I got the add-on PG-13, which made as much sense as the end of the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. See this with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You need it.
