So I know I voted 1 out of 10, but it really doesn't deserve more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe in any of the stars signed to do this ridiculously absurd project. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were great in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story sucked and I urge anyone who sees this in the video store to not even pick it up and read the back cover, but just go away ... I don't even want to get into what the movie is about because it's too stupid to patronize. <br /> <br /> Don't rent this! It's terrible! Terrible!
