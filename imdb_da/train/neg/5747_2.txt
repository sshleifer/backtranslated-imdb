I love Zombie Movies and I love amateur productions. And the meat market 2 really starts promising with a nice tribute to Fulci's Classic "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some of the makeups are good for such a budget movie, and some actors (the vampire lady and the chef) really stand out, but otherwise there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I don't expect a new Romero here, but there's not a whole movie sequence that even has a little bit of excitement or shock. The director is sure how to behave in body crawling and exciting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it is time to learn something more. In the MeatMarket2 Gore rhyme with drilling - for me it's not enough - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
