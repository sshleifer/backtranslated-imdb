Just finished watching the American Pie: Beta House, and I have to say that it was such a garbage can of crap. The first 3 American pies were fun, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. As you expected from the movie, Beta House, it's about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and the most original part of them all fall in love. Of course, the guy who has his way with the chickens is Stifler, who, along with his fellow players, is trying to accomplish another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super false. It's just very predictable, and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college struggle to see who gets it all (something like that) To sum it up: terrible play + boring script + Wrong use of American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten, though most people sucked there were lots of nudity and beautiful girls, like 2 fun scenes :)
