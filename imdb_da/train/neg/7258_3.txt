This grainy film has a cool sequel, and one of those word-of-mouth features you just have to see. Maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural area in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, who knows the legend is true. This story is told in documentary style told by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual places talking to the people involved. The legend changes with the narrative, but during the late 60's and most of the 70's the surrounding Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature traveling along Boggy Creek. Long glued with three toes and standing over 7 feet tall, this hirsute creature caused periodic damage and scared 'bejeebers' out of most of the community. I personally crossed the little Boggy Creek bridge in 1974, and yes, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. It was of course about 1:00 in the rain. When I arrived at Shreveport, I laughed.
