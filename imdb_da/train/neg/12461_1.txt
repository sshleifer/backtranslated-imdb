Unlike most other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, my family and I found this movie on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space. In short, this was a movie based on a manuscript whose author was far too clever. Instead of trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear way, it was assumed that it constantly throws the most vague and difficult to connect 30 second vignettes of different stories from a dozen or so "stories" to the audience made too big. and clear view. No, Mr. It doesn't. What gives you good viewing is total clarity, precision, plot and stories - and characterizations - that have a beginning, a middle and an end. <br /> <br /> This kind of biographical presentation - like the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligible to the utmost. <br /> <br /> Many thanks for the television and DVD presentation of Hollywood and British Film Noirs from the 1940s and 1950s, whose authors, director and actors knew the value of clear storytelling, poetry and action that mattered. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD that this family will not review again.
