I once used Wesley Snipe's name as a clue to go ahead and see a new, pristine movie where he looks. So now, my Snipes movie recommendation method has failed for the first time. Complete. I should have come here to see these reviews. Snipes should be ashamed of letting his otherwise serious efforts be so wasted in "The Contractor". <br /> <br /> One of my worst girls' fears has come to bitter fruit. I was afraid that the shaky, unclear, pseudo-documentary, "unnoticed" steering and editing style (first brought to my attention by Paul Greengrass-directed "Bloody Sunday") could spread to other movies. Greengas disease style was then brought to unpleasant new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy film. My fear had happened. In my opinion, these films are made very bad by these motion-inducing methods, which falsely blurs for "action-enhancement". But "Bourne Franchise", which Greengrass so lovers call his cash cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessionally in search of fast, large bucks. Read my lips, your Hollywood types. The action must be clearly photographed and presented, not just hinting at bad, lazy movie techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" goes as far as imitating the "Bourne Ultimatum" in infinitely repeated sound bites, in hopes their young (seemingly evaluated) audience cannot feel them. For example, if I hear a police "Yankee-Romeo" once again, I just scream. Chances are good I don't want to hear it again: I'll definitely never see "Contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those of you who have not yet seen "Contractor": just be content with the peace this lack gives to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I'm tempted to lower it to a 1.
