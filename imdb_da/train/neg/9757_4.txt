Not the greatest movie to remember Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordman I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is described as adventure and horror. Forget about fear - there is no one. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; Just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who will be King. <br /> <br /> The main file of the movie was to see Graciela Nilson, who made only four movies in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss. Where did she go?
