Put a DVD of this flick in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate for a future generation a perfect example of one that guarantees minimal rating on a 1 to 10-star scale. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been top notch - in ratings and with tens of thousands of earnings annually - with their television series'. But each has not been successful in big screen offers. This has also been the case for other television personalities - perhaps because many of the stories presented in two hours or so appear more suitable for either a 10-minute shit or at most the 22 or 23-minute drama in half hours program. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not have a single item that would warrant two or three minutes on MAD TV, SNL or anywhere on a screen or stage. <br /> <br /> The date of origin is listed as 2002, but release date - for DVD only - is shown as 2004. It was also filmed not long before Rodney Dangerfield's death, so it is a redeeming value that it was likely to be at lease Get hundreds of thousands more dollars to his heirs. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of it but found it when I turned on my set and was sincerely fascinated by it. Some movies are so terribly horrible that they judge some kind of top rating in the other way - so bad that you can move the call backwards to 9 or 10. "Outside Space Plan 9" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / Village Folk Opus, "Can not Stop the Music," is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this flick falls even there. Although Rodney's previous work (as well as some of his co-members) was not "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca", there were many humorous moments and a story that gave at least one motive of interest. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have a moment or two worth of such material.
