After seeing a dozen episodes, I decided to give up on this show as it unrealistically depicts what is mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I believed my profession was shot. I am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain the game why what is displayed is close to "make-believe" of adventure. <br /> <br /> Choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes appears as a genius, but even he would have to spend a long time investigating an appropriate model, especially to try to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. People are irregular and random, there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about it in the 1950s. Although there was a model for a particular type of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoichastic), which means it has a good chance of making a wrong prediction. <br/> Secondly, assuming the right model for someone or a situation is found, model parameters should be known. These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as gravity acceleration (9.8 m / s2) and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes should be different from genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And after the model and parameters are selected, they must be tested. It is strange that they are not, and by miracle they exactly match the situation being predicted. <br /> Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by numbers but also by sci-fi movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try doing Excel to solve a complex model with many equations and variables, and you will find a herculean job. Although Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he can be stuck with hardware that will be terribly slow. And even with the right software / hardware combination, the model solution can take days to reach. He'll fix them right away! I could use my computer in my research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it's far from being the best show. The characters are somewhat stereotypical, but not even extremely fun, like those in Big Bang Theory. The crimes are boring and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes makes the FBI look pretty incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some games, the show can work. For others it is hard to swallow!
