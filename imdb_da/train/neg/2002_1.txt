A shaky handheld camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary appearance, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started getting exercise disease right from seeing it. It looked as if a person with cerebral palsy held the camera (no offense meant CP sufferers, but I don't think you would expect to get much work as a film photographer!) The camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and I found It was unattainable and gave up after 10 minutes of torture. I checked back a while later (it showed on TV) and it didn't get any better. I suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you might have eaten!
