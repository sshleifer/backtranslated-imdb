Millie is a juice. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She catches him so cheated on her and separates him ... but let him keep the baby she claims to love. At the beginning of the 1930s, she would have been entitled to violent spousal and child support, but let the guy be incredibly easy ... without support ... what a juice! Later, when she has a girlfriend and life seems pretty good, he also turns out to be a cheat! Wow, she has difficulty choosing men. <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad conditions, Millie changes. Now she is a wild party girl - doing all she can to distract herself from her luck. Suddenly many years pass. Millie's daughter, whom she left early in the film, is now 17 and strange fashion has not changed a bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes it's another evil man!) Now seems to be her daughter's friend, but he has delicious designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl she will kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next time! <br /> Overall, the movie is a confusing and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X", but much, much less focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to have little meaning. And the film seems to have a bit of everything thrown into it - as long as it supports the notion that all men are pigs. Unusual but not very good.
