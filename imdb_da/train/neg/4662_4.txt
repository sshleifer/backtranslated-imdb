The authors probably had no experience in the army and probably never looked at a history book, but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit to take a long-term look at the role of black soldiers in World War II. The act is confused and incredible - any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the casting is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the money I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate - the men wear Korean war uniforms, and it was pretty miserable when the American army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain was like northern California. The script never makes it clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a good hint that shows some of the men wearing Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which other set of troops would likely have been issued. This basic story page (racist southern officer who controls black troops) should have been extended to a great budget production again and it's not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is and I admire the creators of this movie to make the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this a while ago and thought it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
