Its one of the stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I can't see where all this "not so bad" dirt comes from. The play is terrible, it follows exactly the same story as all the other dancing movies out there. It's terrible! The name should scream, don't look. "How she moves." Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had half decent dance scenes, they didn't even deserve a clock. I give it a 1 out of 10 just because there is no zero. I seriously ask someone with an IQ of over 60 not to see this and not to waste your money. 1.6 / 10 should tell it all. This movie should not even be made.
