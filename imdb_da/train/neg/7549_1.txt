If Edward Woodward were flicks on this movie, then that was what he would scream into horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry people, but probably enough. We had few Carter, the Italian job, Alfie and now this. What are the similarities? No. It is not entirely coincidental that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor. The most important common ingredient in these originals is the British britishness. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were quirky English movies with a unique charm / atmosphere that just can't be replicated in the US. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult movie than to bastard it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a hard job before it even hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic, the other said cult film; It tolerates genre, intelligent scripts, A-grade actors, the music score, set-pieces that speak the description and all the stories around the movie. So here comes a remake. Do not worry. No originals were damaged during this remake. Some major aspects of history needed to be reworked for the modern United States - communication, paganism, virgins. But it is just about the whole premise. So we give the police a Nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares. Then without a cell phone mast on the island, which sort out the communication - but in the real world it would not happen. Cops just don't miss out. Give him a blood link to motivation rather than the collapse of beliefs and you have remake. Wafer thin though isn't it? <br /> <br /> It was just that everything was put on a trowel. The name changes were simply hammy, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no center for catching your rents, just a few houses scattered around a forest, and that was it. Willow was just annoying by not giving any information at all, and Cage was useless to let her get away with it. When he went into the well, you just knew he would lock it. The play was signposted all the way to the end - and you just wanted to hurry and end. The epilogue was absolutely fun and didn't know when to stop. <br /> <br /> The end is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. One ends up in the most beautiful sunset after the most terrible day. The other ends with a post-production explain-the-all-to-thickness type conclusion. <br /> <br /> I loved the original but went to the movie theater with an open mind and was thrilled to watch the movie. I left grateful to know that this movie is likely to end during a motorway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever.
