Rarely have I witnessed such an unmistakable waste of talent. There is hardly anything constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of a movie. Which few interesting threads the film seems to promise begins to be a little more than red herring. Student Actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - is deployed in roles that do not go anywhere; an occasional genius instructor produces a movie that looks like it has been filmed through a coffee-colored camera lens; A writer (John Grisham) who has never made any profit is discovering new depths of under-motivated inconsistency. The film has a cheap, lecherous feeling about it - but hardly on a par with comments - it's really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I go on to IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciated comments. This monstrous disaster in a movie just allows me to produce an infinite, bilious rant. I don't want, but only because I no longer want to occupy my "mind" with this bin.
