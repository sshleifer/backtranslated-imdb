This sweeping and insulting movie had fascinated me at first. The characters are the well-known, modest young men who are often seen as hanging bored in a seaside town. Robert is an outsider, but he has his music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay Robert makes a freak that begins on a cannabis and ecstasy journey and enters the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert finishes the movie as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much real life experience this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. A very unbridled connection is made to the Iraqi rebels; During the unnecessary graphic rape, we are exposed to explosions and images of war. The film shows the male peer group's extremism pushed to the borders. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern man. Clay means that men simply cannot help themselves to causing terrible acts of violence. It is strange that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that advocate such divisive propaganda when we are still in London in recent attacks. This is Clay's first movie, I would be happy if it was his last.
