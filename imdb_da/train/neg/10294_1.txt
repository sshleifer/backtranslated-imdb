Nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> There are no characters without personality. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning and no middle. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they are not even allowed to be because this film is not even there. There is no "is" in this movie because there is no plot or character or theme or idea or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There's a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But audio editing is so, and the movie is such that it is not even worth your time, so if you are really interested, I suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something. You get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headaches and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
