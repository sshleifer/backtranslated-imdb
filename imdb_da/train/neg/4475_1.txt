terrible, just awful! my old roommate used to see this junk and it drove me crazy. The book is one of my favorites and it is a shame that some people will never know what it really is because their first impression is from dribble like this. they changed so much that it is hardly recognizable. who baffles me when the book reads like a soap opera anyway, which gives enough foot to modern entertainment. It's like one of the Lifetime movies that says "based on a true story" but is totally fictitious. There are none of the book's feelings or depths, just mindless melodrama. If you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
