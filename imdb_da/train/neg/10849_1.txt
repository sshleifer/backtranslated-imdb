Usually when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head against the B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principles behind a B-Horror movie are camp value, Heavy Gore, Lots of unnecessary nudity and special effects that everyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I have been a fan of the band since they released their first demo in 1995. The movie started on an interesting note and when I saw Dani Filth stamped on an extremely overt latex mask I laughed. When I saw the lesbian sex scene for a lesbian sex scene, I even sounded harder. I spent pretty much the whole movie laughing and when I didn't laugh, I shook my head and wondered how a millionaire rock star would make a movie that seemed to be on a budget of hundreds of dollars. The whole point of this movie seemed to me to attract "Hardcore Goth kids who believe that death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan are the biggest things that invented since Lava Lamps. It really was. For me, this movie seemed like 80.5% of the stuff that happened in this movie just happened to be satanic, this movie had a lot of potential and could really have been a great movie, but in the end this "movie" is really just an extended Cradle of Filth Video.
