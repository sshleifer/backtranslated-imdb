According to IMDb, as well as to all other websites containing a review this "thing" does not have a director. Well, that would definitely explain a lot! Just a lot of people gathered to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin story of devilish worship and women sacrificing within a secluded sanitarium's walls. "Hardgore" is an excellent example of totally demented 70-dirt, as it is really made with a minimum of production values ​​and scripting inspiration. Horror films about satanic cultures were very popular in the early 70s and also pornography, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplified story about a young nymphomaniac girl who is committed to mental asylum, and from the first night she is drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo action. Really, a lot of dildo action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat even split that night. The horror aspects are really poorly elaborated, ranging from ridiculously scary satan masks to virulent deterred penis attacks. Photography and acting are almost unacceptably amateurish, but what do you expect from a movie that contains images of semen-celebrating dildos and speaks amputated male reproductive organs? The leading lady Justina Lynn is a pretty pretty girl with a brilliant body, but most of her co-stars (male and female) are hideous and exaggerated hairy sleazy balls.
