It is impossible for me to objectively consider this film. Not what I haven't tried, remember you - but I sit down and I jump into the old VHS and I see the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again and hug my own Care Bear and watch the movie with open eyes and an eager heart. I can objectively see that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cozy baby merchandising mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil forces that have a thin story and uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old goes, "Yay! Care Bears!" Every time I think about it. So - I (only gently reluctantly) recommend this movie to those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the powerful force of nostalgia while they see it (like me) OR the legally cynical Gen-X / Y - whoever deliberately seeks the wonderful bad / strange (a category where this movie ... definitely belongs). For those who are actually seeking a compelling movie or a healthy family entertainment: You may want to continue looking.
