The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is well paced. It did not fall flat. The next best thing is the acting performances played by the actor who plays fabulous groom-to-be Edward, the always wonderful Holland Taylor, and the actor plays Taylor's husband. The actor helping to criticize Messing's potential outfits in an early stage brings a wonderful absurd-yet-winning quality to the case. Okay, it's about it on the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I love, is far more trustworthy, expressing contempt for Brass than any scene where he is trying to be either business or supportive. As others note, he does not seem to have any emotional investment in this business than wrapping it as soon as possible. Brass, on the other hand, sincerely tries to carry the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She does it enough, but is simply not strong enough for an actress to pull out all this without help. Give her an "E" for effort and a "C +" for performance. Given Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could have helped Brass could have been an excellent cavalry Irons-esquire performance by the actor who played her fiance Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is faint-hearted, mewling and feckless. <br /> <br /> Of course, if I tried to further analyze this, I'd be more aware than most involved. It is harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less unpleasant (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you are far better off seeing "My Best Friend Wedding" again.
