Today, Bea Arthur died so I drove around the IMDb site and somehow ended up on a show called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was an excellent show for its first four or five years, and I firmly believe that I saw each episode more than once. However, I swear I didn't know that a show called "Gloria" existed. Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe that means I had a life as a young adult instead of watching television. <br/> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the franchise "All In The Family" has deteriorated so much that it became a show I never heard of - and one that has been rated very badly by the past proofreaders. <br /> <br /> I considered the show one of the two reasons - the system did not allow me to record a voice and authors and TV execs should be condemned to start a show that had nothing to be in the air and polls the memory of one of the biggest shows in the TV story. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
