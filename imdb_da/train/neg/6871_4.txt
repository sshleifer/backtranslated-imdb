A good concept wrong. Bad action, even worse writing .... After seeing the first two episodes, I wondered why it ever made it two. The characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are just ok. The special effects are simply sad - so much better has been done in the same time frame - where does the money go? The first episode begins to be interesting, so go downhill quickly - the concept of the whole show is just stupid. Now I'm not mistaken, I'm a big Sci-Fi fan and 'geek' - but this show simply doesn't cut it. As I said at the beginning, I am really surprised that it made it season two - so much better has been canceled after just one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.
