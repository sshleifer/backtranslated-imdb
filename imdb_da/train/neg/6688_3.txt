This movie is pretty horrible, but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, and at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good part of the extra material in the film is drama students from NAU. I was a freshman there that year, mining in theater, but for some reason I was not involved in the production. However, I knew more people who did and can deliver this weird fact: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this movie where two of the protagonists, as part of their hazing ritual, have to run bare into the woods. They are seen from behind in the film, do just that. The thing is that they are not the players at all, but two guys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "stunt posteriors" remains anonymous, at least to this site, unless they decide to "um" "reveal" themselves!
