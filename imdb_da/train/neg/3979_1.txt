OK, it's got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie I've ever had the accident to see. Like any other Olsen twins movie with the possible exception of New York minute, this movie had no history, gaping plot holes, creepy pointed plays and bad filming itself !!!!!!!!! In case you haven't guessed yet, I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I saw this was because I was really bored and nothing else was on. I wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical films where they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day while getting the help of two cute guys throwing them right away. The least they could be having a guy 4 1 or getting both of them to fall 4 the same guy. The basis of this story was so carefree and simply stupid. even a young child could see the flaws in it. Maybe they should split up and start making movies individually or maybe movies with another kind of story. Anyone who liked this movie was not offense - either really stupid, really artificial or has not seen any really good movie. Or maybe they are really wise and have only bad movie choices. On the one hand, I would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience. The only thing that is good 4 is some rib that splits laughter on the pathetic attempts to be cool. If you look for laughs it is fun. basically I give it 0 or less.
