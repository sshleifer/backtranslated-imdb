Seriously crappy movie. First, the movie starts with a policeman and his partner parked outside a warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" policeman takes a girl they had pulled over into the warehouse's attic room, while the beginner's club is sitting outside thinking about what might happen up there. The "bad" politician returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the novice does not think there are any problems, but he still speculates on what was in the bag so he asks, gets a scary answer, and then he thinks everything is okay (for now). The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a frequent scene (did it a little better). But in the end, people begin to catch, which took a while considering how it was obvious. A girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just if she dies as you do. Now the "bad" policeman kills this magically protected bitch, and then he drops off the duffel-pounded body. When she had eye-boogey magic put on her, she came back with lots of eyeshadows to indicate that she might be a zombie ... also the magic curse causes all the other girls to become "eyeshadow monsters". Some of the girls meet with a guy who apparently is a currency specialist and he offers them a ride (they usually look to him apparently). But when the girls see other people, like the one girls man, he freaks out because she's horrible (some people freak out, but others don't even notice) .... massive plot hole. <br /> <br /> So, to unpack it, the eyeshadow monsters kill the "bad" policeman who again ends up being a zombie in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prep us for a sequel! As someone would like to see part 2 of this cow fall.
