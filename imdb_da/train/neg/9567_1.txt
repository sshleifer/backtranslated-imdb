It happened with Assault at Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008, and now it has happened to another classic from the 80's Wargames ... :( Why, oh why, oh why would Hollywood never learn? be alone ...! They can't be restored ...! They suck .... We all hate them ....! <br /> <br /> Those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, rent / buy it now .... !! The hardware can look dated, special effects are not new millennium, but it still knocks this nonsense hands down .... <br /> <br /> For Those of us who lived through the 80s when hacking was sexy, the internet was somewhat mysterious, and your disks came as an 8 "floppy variety, and now we have the wisdom to avoid this movie as a thermonuclear war! > <br /> Never before has "a good chess game" seemed the better option.
