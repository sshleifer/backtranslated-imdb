As a physics student, I have become aware of many idiot professors and other so-called experts in the field. As I continue my studies, I learn more and more about real physical experiments that are going on and about the people who do things right. <br /> <br /> Then my friends tell about this "physics movie" they want to see. I don't know anything about it, I'm excited and hope the information will be well presented. <br /> <br /> I've done REAL quantum mechanics; this was not it. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that happens to a subatomic particle can and will happen to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about it in a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10 ^ 30 such subatomic particles. There are a million billion billion billion particles! The more "mysterious" quantum effects of only two particles can have a 50% probability of canceling each other completely. When you add more and more particles to the mixture, it becomes almost impossible to get a large net quantum result. To tell us to believe this is a valid assumption without rationality behind it ... It's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts during this movie. But they were presented in the most misleading way I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't say much about the neural part of the movie, as I haven't had any medical training. It seemed like it might have had a little more truth to it, remember my days in biology, but I can't say. <br /> <br /> At least this movie had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they were actually) scene. In order not to ruin the priceless plot that drives this movie, but the protagonist goes to a wedding where she sees all the different types of personalities "driven" by their peptides *, and then cuts the film to the dance floor where we are spliced ​​between people dancing, some times surrounded by CG peptides, and a full CG scene, filled with dancing peptides. The movie at that time tried to tell us how we are "addicted to emotions" so we are treated to the full song of the smash hit, "Addicted to Love". <br /> <br /> This scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through this scene and still take this movie seriously ... yes, you are the ones to "open your eyes".
