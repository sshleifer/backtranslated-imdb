"Laugh, Clown Laugh" released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clerk named Tito. Tito has raised a founder (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) for adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in circus life and she has become a successful ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I couldn't pass by that Tito, now well into the Middle Ages, has hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not his biological father, he has raised her as a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor permeates the entire movie. Tito competes for Simonetta's feelings with a young and beautiful 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta is obvious to the young man, but feels guilty of giving up Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The film's whole premise is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito what a stupid old old fool he is (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is remarkable only because of Loretta Young, who would continue to have a good career. While I love Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole movie looks to me and is just as creepy.
