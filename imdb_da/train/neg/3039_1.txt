I can always tell when something will be a hit. I see it or hear it and get a good feeling. I did not get a good sense of sight. I was not at all excited about this movie, and I'm not at all surprised that it is classified here as one of the worst 100 movies. I was actually proven right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that kicked me off was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I'm black by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title and this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, then the actor, and all I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think the dance movie theme is overdone. At least "you got served" was better than this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack didn't bother me.
