Sometime somebody out of the blue looks a little bit at me and asks "What's with SNITCH'D"? I know immediately that they have a case of barely hidden amusement + horror. You see, I was a cinematographer on the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some points regarding this "interesting life experience". Originally, SNITCH'D was called A HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, one day after packing TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that so many indie features in the era were never distributed in spite of festival prizes ... it became an eternal victim of SAGs fine print infamous experimental function contract. But I divert ... Even though I was rolling and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000 and not wanting to break the pace, I took it. Well, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed the myth. <br /> <br /> Let's just criticize it as "movie school" for many involved, even included. SNITCH'D was shot in two weeks in August 1999 in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill learned drama at a gymnasium in the latter city (yes he is a drama and English teacher ... consider while watching the movie or even observing the use of apostrophe in title) and hence the location and cast. <Br /> <br /> Notice in his cast was the only known dramatic appearance of LA's Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and with greater influence, the debate by Eva Longoria who had just arrived in Hollywood and was like eager to get a movie under her belt. I have to say that her professional dedication, focus and "let's do that" attitude kept me inspired and was a shadow of her stellar-yet-to-come. <br /> <br /> Snitch suffered from poor optics, getting light or electricity, several boom operators, and delivering an uncorrected offline to overlap. None of it overshadows the actual content that speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> At least in 2003, the movie was sold to distributors (with a net loss I understand) who inexplicably had no pictures of Eva in the box (then she was a growing, working name), but who managed to get a clear picture of what seems to be an authentic latino gangster to give credibility to SNITCH'D. When Cahill's second passion is an antiquarian bookstore, it seems to confirm that he believes you can actually judge a book by that cover ... as so many have downloaded this DVD based on that sleeves. A year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had cold, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any game despite the festival's intention. <br /> <br /> Six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie titled JUAREZ, Mexico. Although he had prepared the process; my participation was dependent on casting, script, and crew control, and the resulting movie actually looked promising in newspapers, for what it was ... a cheap detective story about the mass murder of girls in Juarez; Despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER been in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has distribution and is simply awaiting publication coinciding with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, the Virgin of Jerez and BORDER PLACE.
