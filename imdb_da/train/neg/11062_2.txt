Way to go ace! You just made a chilling, roughly exciting story about a necrophilic cannibal in a soft, soft drama. Of course, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two kinds: Horror or Documentary? Nor was this. It wasn't close to any detailed facts (it actually had no substance at all). It wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very disturbing. (As if you would have had to try !!) What the hell was this writer / instructor thinking ?? Here is one of the most real-life examples of sick serial killers ever, and we are being badly shot, badly-acted gay carrying roofie rape and long droning flashbacks alone in his old-age home. I think Jacobson actually tried to present (or invent) the "soft side" of j.Dahmer.
