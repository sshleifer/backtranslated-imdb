This movie started with a section of a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain engaged to this movie. This movie is a very cynical pile of waste made by some people with animation skills, but completely lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. It is a shockingly bad effort that comes from a large study. Clearly, there are morals and motivational issues at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. That the management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation. This movie joins my very short "worst movie of all time" lists.
