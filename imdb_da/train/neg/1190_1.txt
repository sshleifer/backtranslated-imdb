Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring it down. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Definitely a one-trick pony, I think they could have made other American chefs come to the table on this one as Iron Chefs. That kind of dish this duo comes up with really ... doesn't reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don't think Batali himself went to the cooking school, actually. There are many good cooks in America, I just wonder why they are not appearing on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also help to get more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts that can handle pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he is a little too flippant / fun for this role.
