You ever sit through a movie and after that it's all like a great "wtf!". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another straight two video action feed flick you can immediately forget to have seen or better not yet see it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasted in this time, so are the quick mercenaries to hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad, and the action sucks and what's the point of seeing an action girl if the action blows? Robert Patrick especially hits a new layer in an action sequence that has him shooting a machine gun while standing on the head of a moving school bus. Co-stars the surrounding Charlotte Lewis and Canada's own Scott Hylands (by TV's Night Heat Fame).
