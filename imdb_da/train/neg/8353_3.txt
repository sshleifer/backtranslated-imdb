Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda who also instructed), an aging gambler, wins young teenage Wanda "Nevada" (beautiful but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, the unlikely pair (of course) starts a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> It's the story and there's really no need to search for a deeper meaning in it. It's just not there. The plot is also very weak, which was a surprise when Peter Fonda was in charge. <br /> <br /> Looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields. However, her character is so annoying (especially in the beginning) and stupid that she never comes out as sexy or attractive. Too bad, but considering history I doubt what can be done more of this. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this movie. He must even have spoken to his father (Henry Fonda) for a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, this was their only movie together. Couldn't Henry be in EASY RIDER for example? 3.10
