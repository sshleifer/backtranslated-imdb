I don't see much television and came across this show. Reality show? I hope this is not too true. If I were a man and had such a grudge and married someone so snotty, it would be a reason for divorce. I think she is doing a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love. It is a thing that is wrong with our world now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to really love another. It is self-sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt. It does not give a very good feeling to see what should be in private counseling. If his personality on the show is too genuine, he deserves someone much better who would show true true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or made up for ratings ???? I really want to know. Sincerely, GB
