This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people who left the theater, others fell asleep (ok, it was a sennat show) ... This is a no-sense movie, one of those that can make you never see one of it ordinary image again. I would love to watch this movie as I am deeply interested in what is happening to the authors of such waste. Do they let them do all those ridiculous things, or do they actually think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is terrible except for some instrumental things that remind you of a former Bjork album. Even if you are a fan of Bjorks music, you must be at home. That's the best thing to do. The small, small pieces of lovely music are no reason to go out and submit to this torture. God!...
