A family moves into an old house in Japan. But there's a catch it's haunted (BOO !!!). Aw, doesn't mean getting you jumping. It's just a review. Sit down again. Ahem, now it is haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and her lover in slow motion. This of course makes a 3 minute scene stretching out to approx. 7 or 8. Horrid acting. Horrid story. But how little can you ask? Well it was so bad, my brain began to melt and leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips. It was so bad when Doug McClure came on the screen, I asked that I had flashbacks of Small Wonder (yes, I know Doug was in "Out of this World" and not "Little Wonder", but that's pretty much the same damn show & i can soften the "little wonder" theme better) There are movies that are so bad they are good. This is not one of them <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My character: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one nude, one just topless) <br /> <br />
