... and even then they themselves can live without seeing it. To be honest, this movie (if you expect to call it that) is of pure interest to bondage freaks. Bettie Page fans will learn nothing new (and I don't mean * nothing), nor will they enjoy the hot fuzzies to experience something that is known, loved or loved. <br /> <br /> Never mind the scary manuscript, tree, less-end community theater acting, the complete lack of direction, crappy lighting, or any of the other bargain basement production values. This is definitely "Hi, kids, let's make a movie!" film production of the lowest order. I suppose you could be grateful that they knew at least how to run the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this is clear why this thing is so fair * wrong *. It is wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page, a slightly juicy girl whose only resemblance to the queen of baskets is dark hair and the brand bangs, completely fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged . This is apparently a good thing for her movie career sooner and later this miserable surplus, but not for the miserable surplus itself, which consists primarily of a series of lovingly restored B&D sets that are sandwiched between horrible fake biographical scenes delineates Ms. The fall of the page from grace (so to speak). In fact, there is probably more information about themselves about the page's life in opening and closing credits than the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. This is not a worthy companion movie for "The Notorious Bettie Page." This is not at all a worthy movie. This is a fetish piece that is about the attraction of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and does it without class, without style and without any real sense of understanding Bettie Page's character. No real Bettie Page fan would seem to be anything but a disappointment I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If you are free, remember that time is also money. Your can not be worth much, but I bet it's probably worth you to be sorry you wasted time with this one. That's what I'm done, you've been warned.
