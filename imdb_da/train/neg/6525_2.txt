I gave this movie a 2, and although I consider myself a science fiction fan, I found this movie very difficult to take seriously. It was a late night at the AMC and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a couple of laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects are about average for the time period - not terrible, but not good either. Of course we know more about Mars now than we did then, but we really can't hold it against this movie. The main reason I didn't like this movie is because of the story. There were several parts of this movie that I wish to have been explored in more detail - the astronaut's damage / condition, the city on Mars, the creature of the lake, etc. Overall, the movie is much like a long episode of the 1960s version of the outer borders - complete with a cheesy end.
