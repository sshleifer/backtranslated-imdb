Charles Bronson continued his 80's decline with what might be his worst movie of the decade, if not ever. In it, he plays a detective who goes in great lengths to track a pimp who has abducted an Asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder. It is a shameful attempt at action and is possibly the most depressing movie ever made. Many people consider the desires of death to be Bronson's worst movie. The Death Wish continuations were not good films, but in most cases were made competent and very attentive. However, Kinjite is a completely boring thriller, characterized by medieval racism and child smuggling. It's really a cleanable movie, and it's all made worse by the fact that it's trying to preach a "law and justice" mentality that's too flooded to really say anything. In fact, the film of strange sex begins to be interrupted with Bronson and then anal rape the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater I watched this was about to interfere with this scene's awkwardly, only to touch the unpleasant pimp that raped the girl in this movie. It has nothing but exploitation and really the film was not well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work. Bronson works more in things, but clearly it's too contradictory to save. I would like to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately his worst. The action sequences are also poor. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (terrible)
