What an insult to the SA movie industry! I've seen better SA movies. The comments I read about Hijack Stories, by saying it's worth a ten out of ten are pretty scary. A film's assessment should not depend on ... ", OH, A MOVIE FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. LETS BOOST THEIR INDUSTRY BY SAYING GOOD GOODS ABOUT THEIR WORK, THAT IT IS Poor. We have the expertise to make good films. Don't judge the movie industry about what people say how big they think Hijack Stories are. We can tell good stories like Cry the beloved Country and Shaka Zulu. Cry the beloved country, I give 9 out of 10. Great conductor of Darryl, great play by two great older actors, wherever they are. Hijack Stories .. I give 1 out of 10. It could only be people involved in the project that would give it high score. I would have done the same if it was my movie.
