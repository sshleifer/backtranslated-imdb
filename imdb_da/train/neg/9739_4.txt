It is not so much that spontaneous combustion had little potential. In fact, the implicit title phenomenon is quite exciting, and at least the opening half promises this Tobe Hooper effort to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can. But somewhere between Brad Dourifs again and again performance and the all-encompassing intricate plot, this excitement will lose its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, who was presented here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated, is average guy Sam. Of course, average guys do not stay average for long in horror movies, so after a well-written outline, we see Sam's various body parts begin to ignite. Soon, he also turns other people much into the crazy pal Lisa, who is played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the title of the movie involves a brand-new monster on the loose, director Hooper chose to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an extra human depth that would otherwise be lacking, but it also prevents us from really fearing the human flamethrower. We wonder if it would have worked better as a fair villain-against-all effort at the NATURE MARK ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS IMPROVEMENT is a fairly nominal effort when all is said and done. It will bring extra appeal to Dourif's fans and those who cannot get enough 1990 horror, be it good, bad or in between, but only on a slow night.
