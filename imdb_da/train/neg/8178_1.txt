Have you ever been watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have passed, and suddenly you realize you've actually seen the movie before? It happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is very fraud. I would swear that the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. In any case, I was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this movie or ... it's simply meaningless junk. I am heavily leaned towards the latter, but I think some out there have developed a connection to this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. A plot. Let's see ... there must be a plot around here somewhere. No, I can't find it. It is pretty much about some primary school's seniors who work dopey and do drugs and speak in a language that became obsolete decades ago. One of the female students is in love with her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (which he actually refers to as icebergs), so he is receptive to the girl's progress. There is a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and lots of spastic dancing. Our cat, BooBoo, was transfixed by the dancing high school kids. She looked with great intensity when the dancers gazed and shook out on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1.10
