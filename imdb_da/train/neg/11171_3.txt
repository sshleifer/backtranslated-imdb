Very much movie from the ages - extremely long sequences without dialogue, bad flashbacks and an almost completely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. O'Toole is riveting when he speaks; Unfortunately, he spends much of his time looking through bushes. Alastair Sims is always a joy to watch, but he is also terribly under-utilized. <br /> <br /> The film has a further positive aspect, showing many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (like the informal look of Mosley graffiti) that many people today are not aware of. For many of today's films about World War II, the Allies paint as good and as good as all evil when history tells us that people are far more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> This would be a great movie for when you recover the flu and are bundled on the couch and unable to absorb too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes are stabilizing, this is the movie for you.
