I can afford the people who made this movie too, if you want to make a movie like this, be sure to get f / x to back it up. Also don't get a lot of z list actors to play in it. Another thing almost all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so don't take it blatantly in copy. All in all, this movie, f / x sucked, acted sucked, story unoriginal. Let's talk about the actor in just a second, the Carradine guy who career peaked in 1984 when he did "Nerd Revenge" (which was actually a great comedy). He's not exactly z list, he can act. He should just have said no to this s bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as a "geek" and it should have been. I understand he has bills to pay, but I do not apologize for this s-bag. Did I call this movie yet? OKAY. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2 hours in my life, I could have used to do something productive like watching paint shells, and I feel cheated. I'm closing that note. Thank you for your time.
