This story of three women is a very sensitive study of: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37, and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the eldest who is Muriel's mother. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations for life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriel comes from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so you wait for something - in the event of an accident - that could dramatize this story. As time goes on, you discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and no more. This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case, so you are left with a sense of emptiness.
