I ended up seeing this whole (very long) movie because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivety. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would have participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 were people really * so * naive? The plot seems written by a confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a superpower conflict, and the Russians are actually the good guys where the Secretary General of the Communist Party is a clever and spiritual man who, suddenly after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag . The priest will soon be the pope with a number of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal reconciliation process portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you might imagine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle by starving half their land to death. To solve this lesser hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to fairly distribute Western capitalist wealth to the poor workers in China). <br /> <br /> Our good old buddy General The secretary gets a little worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to mediate peace. They meet with the Chinese leader, Peng, who looks and works like a 15-year-old boy. You will roll on the floor and laugh at what people in 1968 thought the Chinese were like. Comrade Peng calls for Western capitalists to pay (which is quite logical, should capitalists not always pay for the insanity of socialism?), And that the Pope must also sacrifice for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the pope is crowned in Rome, he promises the entire Catholic Church's wealth worldwide to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And thus he saves the world from the atomic nucleus. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there are also some minor subplots, which unfortunately give little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give it three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely like a pope. He is far more plausible than Zorba the Greek.
