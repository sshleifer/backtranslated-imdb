Good Grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this movie is. Don't make me wrong, I didn't expect much to start with. Let's see, a PG-13 slasher flick is destined to lack ummm ... slash, so no one should be surprised at the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© on the display in all the other aspects of this movie that really blew me away. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a reverse for the books ... NEVER NEED TO CHANGE - thereby breaking the cardinal rule for basic screen writing - character development. If you think at the end of this movie, the poor little girl will come back and finally kick some ass, think again. <br /> <br /> In addition, we may be passing the least exciting (and definitely the least frightening) killer ever to reach the genre. I'm not funny when I say that Dora The Explorer has scary villains than this movie. Finally, because all the potential for excitement or gratuity is removed by the inappropriate (and apparently thirteen year old) instructor, what might be left to fill 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Create, that's what. <br /> <br /> Lots of cabinets: large closets, small closets, mirror cabinets, wardrobes for Narnia, so many amazing cabinets you don't want to dress yourself for another year. In fact, this movie had just been called "CLOSET" and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a picture of the audience as sleeping and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent: "what f * @! We just wasted our time watching!"
