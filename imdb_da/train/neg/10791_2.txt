Horrible movie. If there is a Turkish movie, you should avoid seeing in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Other than couples cheaply laughing this movie achieves nothing, nada, zilch, nil. The dialogue is cheap and sexual clich√©s are everywhere. The director has to watch more movies before attempting to lead his own. The red-haired women show examples of what an actress shouldn't do. If you are interested in learning how not to act, this is a perfect example of bad action. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there's nothing good I can say about it. I really don't like writing about it so much. Jeez!
