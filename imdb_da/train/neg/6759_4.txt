Another case of a decent DVD case that fights the movie's film quality. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a workable job and Damn! the throw looks good. I have never seen many muscle-bound guys stick together regularly. This movie really wanted you to think Rochon was the killer, but it wasn't. My biggest problem with the movie was that I didn't really care much about who was the killer, and the real killer had little meaning when it was out of the blue and the filmmakers thought 'ha, betcha didn't see you coming , sucker! '. Yes, there were continuity errors about (mainly with Mrs. Rochon's ever changing wardrobe), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure at first it was just a thin blurred excuse for girls to go topless, but it was just a gimmick. The dialogue was overly thought and painful. <br /> <br /> Just don't have high expectations to go into this and it won't be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully undervalued.
