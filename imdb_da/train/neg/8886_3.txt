Not very impressed. It is difficult to offer any spoilers to this movie because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything gets clear in the first ten minutes, and from there it's like watching paint dry. The action also seems very bad, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist ear films that are occasionally seen on Chinese television during the daytime. Although it is hard to tell with the female role of Yuwen, as history apparently only requires her to walk around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li, who somehow has a reputation as a good actress in the West to constantly have a scowl on her face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's movie "Blue Kite" was a much better movie. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a small town was set in the late 40s. In contrast to the blue dragon, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, but the ruins of the city do not seem to be more than a scenic backdrop. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride the popularity of Chinese movies in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a movie that is "beautiful" deep or hypnotic and one that is simply boring and insignificant. <br /> <br /> If any movie fits the description of 'overstated' then it is. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
