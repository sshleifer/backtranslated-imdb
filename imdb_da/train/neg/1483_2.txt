I only gave this ridiculously termed comedy horror flick a 2, because several famous porn stars from the past appear in it. A group of tourists, probably on holiday in Ireland, but actually in Canada, run by a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or something and the plot is more or less straight out of the HILL'S EYE and WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I'm miscounted, there's only one mutant on the screen and he's not that impressive. Kind of like the potbellied mummy in the homemade movie from about five years ago. Some gory but stupid deaths help, but the film is strictly amateurish and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been made to death. No sayings are calculated.
