This is the movie that embodies the D&D fear of the 80s (and even today). The fear is that people who play D&D (or any other role play for that matter) will be "sucked in" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill sprees, child victims, suicides, and so on). ). Great movie for anyone who likes to blame society's problems on lifeless objects, but anyone who has played a role-playing game, video game, or even acting in a game will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It's D&D what Wargames was for computers. Plus, as a movie, it's just cute.
