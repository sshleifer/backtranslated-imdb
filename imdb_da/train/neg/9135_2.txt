Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. This is your magnum opus, a shining example for the rest of us that you are definitely worth nominating for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you say on your 1998 era website). Unfortunately, it is better to be silent and to be deceived than to speak and remove any doubts. With Ben & Arthur you just do it. <br /> <br /> Seen together with lack of instruction or education, the film's spectacle leads us towards the truly bizarre with every new scene. It is this crazy excuse for a story that can also be the film's best ally. Beginning, the homosexual titular characters Ben and Arthur start marrying as far as landing to do so, in the shadow of Vermont's finest palms. But all this durable is just a BLOOD leadership. Saw more blood and more and more blood. I think there should be at least $ 20 in false blood column in the last third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a technical gaff. From the sound of editing to the music, which consists of a single fuzzy base note held on a keyboard, it is odd that the movie itself sticks to the media you are watching. It's such a shame that some decent amateur shows are wasted here. <br /> <br /> Regardless, Sam. I'm sure you've made five characters on this flick in rents or whatever drives bad souls (like myself) to watch this movie. Unfortunately we do not do with you.
