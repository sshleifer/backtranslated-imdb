I can't believe this movie managed to get such a high rating of 6! It's hardly easy and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> In a non-budget way, it reminded me of Star Wars episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you see a total creative train wreck. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It is one of the "festival films" that are only the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made that they think it does "differently", therefore well. <br /> <br /> Poor movie production is not "different" ", it's just bad movie making.
