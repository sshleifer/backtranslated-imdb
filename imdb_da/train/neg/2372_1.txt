Unthinkable silly, superfluous and humiliating closure for the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it resembles director Rachel Talalay intentionally making Wes Craven's original premise a great bad and tasteless joke. This is not only the worst entry into the "Elm Street" saga; It is also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made, and it even bumps into fans of the genre! The story is stupid, the drawing drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all creepy and ?? most of all ?? The special and visual effects are similar to those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences where Freddy Krueger murders his victims are infinite and very uninteresting. Should we be petrified when a jabber Freddy hit Breckin Meyer into a video game character and pogo-stacked him around the house's walls? The story takes us back to Springwood, and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. You would think he would mention it in one of his previous adventures, but no ?? There is only one teenage survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get in touch with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so terrible is the completely illogical structure. John Doe-boy is introduced as the leading character, but then suddenly he dies and the plot continues to revolve around two adults! What about it: Freddy Krueger, who spent five whole films that only killed teenagers, is eventually beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! Kind of like ruining the whole essence, right? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overvalued series, but so far even the weakest entrances had at least some redeeming elements. However, "Freddy's Dead" is simply impractical, and no one should waste his precious time seeing it.
