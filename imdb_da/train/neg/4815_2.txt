Like most comments, I watched this movie under the name The Witching, which is the re-release title. Apparently the original Necromancy is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most scenes in the witch still contain most necromantic scenes and these are still bad. In many ways, I believe that the witch's added nudity at least added some entertainment value! But don't be fooled - there are only 3 scenes of nudity and it is by the people standing around the variety. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is so terribly horrible, it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is horrible and straight out of the Troma cabinet. At least Troma is the tongue of the cheek. This is fair boredom personified. The play is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora the obsessed child in The Innocents would you believe!) The worst with her tall screechy voice. Welles just seems to wait for his pay check. The other female leader has a creepy face, so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is also quite poor. He also looks worrisome as Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is mistakenly filmed with scenes that change for no reason, and editing is crooked. This is because the witch is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one on it. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with the horrible new soundtrack that never closes up. The ghost fashion is just as bad, but the actor is so funny to act that at least it gives something unintentional grin. Really, this film (at least the witch) is only undesirable. It may not have many sane fans as it is pretty unpacked and I actually found it fun numbingly boring! <br /> <br /> The best bit was when the credits rolled - probably so simply better for this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!
