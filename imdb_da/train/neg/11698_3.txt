This step reminded me of Tales from Crypt Keeper. It has the same kind of idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always those in a Crypt story. The same goes for the bad action. Very bad play. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and I didn't expect much. When I see a Stephen King movie, I do not expect much because all his films are horrible compared to his romance. I've read The Shining and Carrie and they were good books. I love how Carrie played out as if it were a true story, and the whole book is a lot of reports and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were nothing like the movies. The ends were very different from the movie versions. I assume from these two novels that all his novels are changing a lot, and the conclusions are always cheesy. I'm ending the Thinner is the worst. So, Cheesy. I would like to read the book to find out the real ending. I suggest anyone who intends to read Stephen King's novels to see his movies before hand so you can compare. And that way you will be very satisfied with the book. I intend to do it with all his novels that were made into movies. I'm sure if they were made for movies, they were really good books ... and the manuscript went horribly wrong.
