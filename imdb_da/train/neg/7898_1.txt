When I saw this movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where these scary creatures, the trash muppets with big pointed teeth, really meant to be scary? Or where they are designed to have a good laugh (I really hope so). If you look carefully, you can even see the strings that serve them (better; pull them over the screen). The whole thing was rather funny than scary, and I was happy to watch the movie because I was amazed at the overall inability to have only a good deal. It's a big joke from the beginning to the end, and I think this movie belongs to a new category: So incredibly crappy, you'll laugh from start to finish. (I won't even try to comment on the actor or all the other things)
