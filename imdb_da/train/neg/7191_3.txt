So last night at midnight slam at Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly overrated by IMDb fans. The action was only common. The management did not bring anything new or interesting. The reason is considerably missing: the movie is about the college degrees and the game they play makes prank calls (7eventy 5ive). And on top of that, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and a slasher with an ax that makes you jump only once or twice throughout the movie, you might like it. If you don't, this movie is not worth it.
