This movie will take place in and around Seattle. Why is Porteau Cove displayed P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park? Provincial parks are in CANADA and not the US. The inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with stylus to "read" that someone has hacked into the bridal shop computer. I didn't know it was possible to use a database storage device. A woman appears in the film without introduction and is never introduced. We learn halfway into the film that this woman works in the district attorney's office. Then, in the correction center, a guard actually prepares Jenks through a door and holds the back to the offender !! This would never happen in a real correction setting. The director really chanted on this - it doesn't happen in real life. The action is sufficient. The reason is good. The camera is good. However, the many errors in continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 votes.
