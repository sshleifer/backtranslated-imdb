The worst and shock full of people who really should know better (the cast has six Oscars between them). It is set in 'modern' Africa (it was made in 1979), and is about slave trade. It's scary written and acted (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden achieve a career low in this one) and lack complete excitement, watch out for some moral focus. It's also ridiculously plotted. You don't believe in a moment that any of the characters will behave the way they do in those circumstances. Richard Fleischer dishes, but you get the impression that it was over the phone. This is as bad as it gets.
