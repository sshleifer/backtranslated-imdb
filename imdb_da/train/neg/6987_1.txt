I'm all for the idea of ​​a great epic of the American Revolutionary War. It is not. (And for that matter, it wasn't Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I go down.) <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on a publicity screen at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before It came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive time, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by respected Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE FAME) and with Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it didn't take long for people to start shaking their seats and whispering horrific comments about Pacino's horrible misunderstood accent - he was to be an American leader of Scottish ancestors (!) - and that of Nastasia Kinski who should recently emigrate from England (!!). Then the story began and it all went down quickly. <br /> <br /> The motivations were confused, the dialogue was horrible, the events had no historical or political context. What was of a plot drove forward in absurd coincidence; At the second or third time, the alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other, it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer / pederast. His accent was also over the whole card. I suppose there were no English actors available. <br /> <br /> Lots of people left. Those who kept trying to choke giggles, so blatantly guffawed. I put it out - I figured that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was mistaken. Inexplicably, Hudson chose to film them with handheld cameras, not even Steadicam, the shaker that gave a misplaced newsletter 'authenticity' that destroyed the scale. <br /> <br /> There was a half famous TV reviewer in the audience a couple of rows in front of me: (late) Gary Franklin from Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was drawn by the construction of the rest of us. And enough on his television segment the next day, he gave the film a '10' on his infamous 'Franklin Scale 1 to 10' while he noticed churlishly about the louts that had disturbed the screening the night before, which clearly I don't know art, when they saw it. What a buffoon. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino was not in another movie for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career was never restored. You can't say I didn't warn you.
