I do not know what this film director Sam Mraovich is, in some way, defeating almost every little aspect of this movie. I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all time. This film should exist solely for the purpose of being undoubtedly 'The Worst Movie Ever Made'. I've seen bad movies in my lifetime, but it somehow breaks what I consider to be a bit more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is fun, but the only funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
