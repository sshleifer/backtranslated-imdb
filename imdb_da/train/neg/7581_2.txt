I watched this movie today in a film school class, and I hadn't seen an Almodovar movie before, but went in and expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a meaningless movie with only a few laughs mixed in with two hours of pure boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that may have worked in their own separate movies, but together they do not add any kind of meaningful whole. <br /> <br /> I thought so. Then, my film professor spent all day explaining the entire movie's hidden little details, such as how the mural depicting stereotype flamenco dancers in the background of the dragon queen scene is a kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has evolved under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is full of clever, small visual tricks and references like this. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. Making a good movie requires more than depth and complexity - you still need to give the audience a reason to pay attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange, off-beat characters, but keeps them in the most common situations reused from other movies, and Almodovar doesn't seem to use them to make any point. What is the meaning of, for example, the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that takes place at the end of the movie? Why is there even in there? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a fun scene that is related to a news broadcast. And that's what it's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just obscene cinematic references and visual signals that seem to exist only to show us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But whatever my film professor says, it takes more than self-releasing trickery for a movie to be good.
