Standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to be starting to throw away plausibility out of the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process. The robbers are another good example of a movie that gives very little meaning. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are being robbed of a very effective "military" gang of robbers. Two police officers are beginning to investigate the case, which will soon become more complicated than it first seems. <br /> <br /> As usual in Swedish films, the casting is mainly composed of the same people you have seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in all Swedish films from the last couple of years! But that's ok, as Persbrandt is one of the few who perform solidly here (as he usually does). The problems with this movie are mostly about the story itself. First, the robbers feel mostly as a background. Rather, it is a film about a young policeman struggling to prove himself in a male world (so it has not been done a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). There is also an incredible plot twist near the end that seems to be as plausible as Alien's landing. But I still thought it was a nice touch when I was half asleep right then. It spiced things up a bit (and actually saved the class from losing another step). In the end, the main problem is the same as with most other Swedish films of this kind. Simply, the action and the excitement do not meet the standards we are used to from other films of this type (mostly Hollywood). It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget to try to make "Hollywood action lights" as they do now. Because this will be another forgettable effort from the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
