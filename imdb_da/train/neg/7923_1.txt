I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels, and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason, but that's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this worthless piece of waste. This film will serve as a lesson for all previous, current and future filmmakers. When you have a movie as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders", you should probably leave sleeping dogs, and you should definitely not try to revive it over twenty years later (unless you have the financial support to pull off a superior successor like Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All You Can Eat") Though you decide to do this, you should spend a little more money than you did on the original and for god's sake ... NEVER film a movie on video ... why do filmmakers try to do this themselves when everyone knows that quality is swine ... I personally but to watch a movie made this way, it is even worth the powder blowing it to hell ... if you can't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original movie, then sell the movie's rights to someone who can ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking of (or smoking) when he wrote this god-a wful script? I mean, come, dog and cat "foreigners" from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, except Liz Renay, were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch the original instead.
