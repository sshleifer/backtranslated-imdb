America. A country of freedom, hope and dreams. This is the nation which since its independence has endeavored to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world for the benefit of all mankind. However, there are times when one cannot do without wanting the Americans to just stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' (and I use the word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with intense purity. This vision of hell follows Calvin's fairy tale, a freakish jewel thief created by attaching Marlon Wayan's cut head to the body of a two-footed dwarf. After an unforgettable killing of a large diamond in Vanessa's handbag, a career woman reluctant to have children, Calvin acknowledges that in order to restore the diamond, he must admit to her. So like any normal man, Calvin will dress up as a 2 year old and park on the poor woman's doorstep, where he is discovered by Darryl, the exciting man Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Darryl is undisturbed by Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the "baby" has a complete set of teeth, stumps, a tattoo, knives and a six-wheel drive. Even more absurd, Vanessa cannot look past Calvin's baby wear either and actually tries to breastfeed the diminutive pears. This miserable attack on humanity's soul tries and fails to find humor in rape, skatology, sexual assault, and pedophilia, but in a dishonest attempt to transform into a piece of family entertainment, Wayan's brothers spread in a swarm of emotions and lack of morals. <br /> <br /> The brothers weakly attempt a freudian rehabilitation of their 20th rape by revealing that he "had a bad father". Repeated beats Darryl in the crotch allows Calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that he and Darryl have always wanted. As if this was not ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempt to sexual assault Vanessa somehow convinces her that it is selfish for a woman to pamper herself with a successful career and that she should instead use her life to play the role of the house-born little woman who spends her time or squeezes out babies and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Wayan's brothers have mixed their crass and twisted humor with the clich√© of sentimentality that has infested much of Hollywood's recent work. In addition, they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians, who are responsible for transforming African-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow of themselves, surrendering to the jokes and coarse sexual gags. By rights, these two should be legally excluded from downloading something that even resembles a camera at a distance. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of US cinema means that next month, they will undoubtedly have filmed two successors and receive millions of dollars from sticky merchandising deals.
