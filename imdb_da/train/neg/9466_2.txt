This movie was physically painful to sit through, perhaps because (as many people my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - fun, smart, capricious and subversive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" sucks all the interests and sparks out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as a cat is mostly confusing. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny tits, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are simple. This movie is OVERLOAD and too long. <br /> <br /> You don't expect all children's movies to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but one put a new one. How could Mike Myers spend the money?
