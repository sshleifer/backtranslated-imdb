This is a strange sex comedy, because there is very little comedy, but a lot of sex, most of which take place behind a car and is so graphic, it makes BASIC INSTINCT a version of TELETUBBIES. I'm not killing you, the sex in this movie is so in your face, it can just choke you, especially if you look with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there is little else to be said than the language in which each sentence appears to contain the F word. This is a rather bleak hyperrealistic British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the biggest investor in British movies explaining that it was made for TV low budget feel
