DECOY is one of the independent productions made by obvious newcomers, but it does not have all the common mistakes that are dropping most of these movies. It has a certain story, it has an appropriate action, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music is not overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will look here to see if it's worth it. I don't know where all 10's come from, as there is no way this movie is so good --- even if you are the movie's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in a theater was Warner's garbage bin of J K Rawling's much-loved and excellent book, the Order of Phoenix Order. By comparing DECOY with PHENIX you mean PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, it was certainly no action allowed by the director, the shooting was horrible, and the responsive indulgent musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a "1" because the scale didn't go any lower. DECOY is 4 times better - in all respects. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give DECOY a try. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - The Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not exceeded by the foolish "10" results here, just enjoy the movie on your own terms.
