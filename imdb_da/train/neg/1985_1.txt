The costumes, dialogue, historical accuracy are terrible. For example - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The nose was precise (as I could tell), but that kind of nose broke the person's neck. Ms. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope without any bad effects until the rope was shot. This type does not choke the person, it killed them at the end of the drop. <br /> <br /> And just before they go in for stealing a bank (in a flashback), they pause in the street for a group hug - with their bandanna hiding their faces - that would have been obvious to people at the street. The bad editing - it's a battery pack underneath that shirt, and it is clear, the clip of the "long ride" shows them riding together and then reverses the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked that they kept the scene with the horse and took a shed - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was crap.
