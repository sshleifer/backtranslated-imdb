This movie must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to hire Zodiac (2007) and accidentally got this. Thought it was a joke before the movie itself. This was terrible, I was waiting to be scary, and it never did. This movie did not have actual facts about the real Zodiac killers. The film authorities obviously didn't interfere with the killings ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about something that wasn't true to its name. I'm sorry I didn't realize it wasn't the movie before. I try to like something out of every movie, I don't hate movies ... ever ... except this one. If you could have given it no stars, I would definitely have. 1 out of 10
