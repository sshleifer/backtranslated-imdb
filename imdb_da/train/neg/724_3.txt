The concept of Sarafina seems to be a healthy one, apart from the musical perspective. It tries to combine upbeat African music with a story describing the cruel conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the movie was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too sharp, and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between cheers and terror. Had it simply been a drama that reflects these conditions, it may have been a good movie, but the scenarios for schoolchildren being shot down by soldiers do not sit well next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Apart from the bad premise, the action is not the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance, just like the rest of the cast. Overall a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
