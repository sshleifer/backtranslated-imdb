Raw, sometimes crass - for me it is the summary of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. He has no point of view - just superficial, digging digs on stereotypes. What is the film about?? It's about reporting a clan of people (so-called types) who are so busy socializing and developing their profiles in life - that they don't have time for anything else. And you're either in it or out of it. Is it that there is no pressure at all to report everyday life. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and is only a supplement; maybe an entertainer to check who is who and what is what. Do not mix the two. And then there is power play - that would happen in every turn of life. So what have you told at the end of it all - nothing - only a few raw jokes tightened together in an otherwise lesser movie.
