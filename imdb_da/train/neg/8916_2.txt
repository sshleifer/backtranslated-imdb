I rented this DVD after watching it while looking for something else. When I saw the title of the jacket, I couldn't believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and loved it, actually admiring Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I've seen maybe 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can take much more. At superficial level, the faux centers, which others have commented on, are simply distracting at best and annoying and bad at worst. The action is boring when it comes to being passionate and comical when it comes to being serious. Portrait of Lou Salome is simply flippant, and the glorious Freud comes out as a little more than a schoolgirl. I see very little of the book's spirit that has been conveyed so far. I was hoping to recommend this movie to my students. Instead, I will refer them to the book. Imagine it.
