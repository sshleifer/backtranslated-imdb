This film is S-L-O-W. Spent most of the movie and actually waited for "to start". <br /> <br /> The setting was gloomy, the manuscript was gloomy, the cinematography was gloomy, the plot was gloomy, the budget was low (not the whole low-cost movie is bad, but this had no redeeming features.) The plot was more consumed with a revenge , a little horrible hunter than the actual Wendigo, which made a very short appearance towards the end of the movie. This was in itself disappointing as this 'Wendigo' was just a bizarre mixture of a tree and a deer. Everything about the movie was uninspiring. <br /> <br /> The parents of the little boy seemed to be pretty secluded and sometimes seemed completely detached from their son. Whether it was down to bad acting or a bad script, I'm not sure, but it only increased my disappointments and boredom levels. There was no food for thought, nothing to pique an interest for. With no real intrigue or chill factor, this movie struck so painfully that you just couldn't care less what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's mood reminds me of the boring movie shown at the award ceremony towards the end of 'Mr Beans Holiday': a film that is artistic and obscene, trying too hard to be deep and meaningful, but comes across as pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I'll never see this again. I only looked to the end in the vain hope that something interesting could happen ... but it didn't.
