This movie was craptacular. I was so emotionally uninvolved in every character that the film's greatest antagonist was actually myself. I played it beautifully; Promising myself I would go away, but just drinking another beer hopes it would auto-magically transform into something exciting along the way. Even in this state, I couldn't help but notice that Cuba's appearance was as flimsy as track paper. His obsessive dedication to his job was done unbearably as well as his one night binge following the mistake of his own idiot standards. Burt came on the screen as general, that's right, a general (who carries too much makeup). I fell into a scary quick binge for rival Cubas, except that mine was real and I blunted my toe. Reward! Compensate my stump toe!
