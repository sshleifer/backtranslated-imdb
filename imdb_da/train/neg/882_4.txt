There is a reason why this went directly to video. The story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a fun way - sex in churches, and other scenes that adjoin tastefully (like the stage in the washroom) destroy this movie. Judge Reinhold as cuckold is okay - but the film itself with its breakdown and revenge is not well done. But it's a good movie for trivia competitions - because so few people saw it.
