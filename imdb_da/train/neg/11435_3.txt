I wish I had known more about this movie when I rented it. I would put it in my queue based on Heather Graham and her strong cred actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt, undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor for so many people thinking of the sibs was a couple ... I don't care how much of the story line is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly does not seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray to her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who found her annoying at times), the cabbie in a row and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers, I wish we'd seen more of it as they The bits we were shown were actually better than most of the rest of the movie). Could have been better.
