At the time of writing this review, it appears that over 50% of IMDb voters had rated this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1. I can only convince that those who give it a 10, were either cast or crew members. <br /> <br /> They say there are enough monkeys and time and enough typewriters, they would monkeys, just by random proddings on the keyboard, eventually writing all of Shakespeare's works. However, I seriously doubt that, given the same number of monkeys and time, you can find a single to give this movie a rating of 10. <br /> <br /> So patiently in the first half, foolishly assumed the film would at some level develop either the plot or the characters, or perhaps make a kind of social comment or hardly evoke intellectual thinking. If I failed, I was ready to accept action, excitement, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way to keep my attention. In the end, I was disappointed, and so much of the second half was considered at double speed when I sought in vain for a small piece of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, no one was there. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" was set against an episode of Scooby Doo, I'm afraid the comic would win hands in the form of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And when it comes to cartoon characters, the various cast members' acting abilities varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Bailey's portrayal of the freaky, death-imprisoned pseudo goth, London, who was so poor that I was almost upset . <I would have liked to have finished on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, another batch party on modern punk rock, even failed to entertain, let alone serve to improve a very bad flick.
