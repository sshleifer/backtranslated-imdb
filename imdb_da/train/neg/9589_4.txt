This movie is horrible if you are aware of it. It's a perfect movie if you just see the colorful pictures dancing across the screen - each one without any apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan and I appreciate musicals. Ultimately, Bowie was in the movie for a total of ten minutes, and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The morality of history was truly befuddling. I couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or not selling out. In the first half of the movie I was chuckling on how cheesy it was, but I liked the camp of the "no selling out" message. When blacks began to be murdered, I thought my ties had been destroyed. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? No, there was a "Keep Britain White" song and dance sequence. I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write a musical about. At least not a musical that could be described as "campy" as I have several times in this review. All in all, I would say that this movie could do a whole lot better if it was in sight and cast better actors. (And put David Bowie into it for longer goddammit!) My character: C-
