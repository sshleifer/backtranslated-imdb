Alien Love (As this film is known in the UK) is a very strange movie. I do not think it is an esoteric art house film in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, but I think it is a TVM with swarms, sex, some really good T&A, a bad script and a very retro feeling. You can only imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years earlier, although of course he would have cut T & A <br /> <br /> Going back to the bad script, one of the problems is getting the characters has every kind of motivation especially Amanda. Why does she get Connie at the bar? Only then could she meet a stranger? Can you see what I mean by retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a lot of other movies from the mid-1980s had this kind of plot where most of them were more defined and convincing than this one. The story continues to follow a poorly defined, unconvincing and illogical way <br /> <br /> That said, I found ALIEN LOVE watchable and not just down to T&A on the screen. As a sci-fi sex comedy, it's much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS EASY
