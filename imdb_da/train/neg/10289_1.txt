This should really deserve an "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I saw this show for years, and the show jumped the shark around Series 7. However, this episode is proof that the show has skipped the shark. The writing is lazy, absurd, self-reliant and not even worth the dirt like Beavis and Butthead. It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, Mummy, Count of Monte Cristo - all the "funny" movies that should not be taken seriously. But there is such a ridiculous as in "this is the worst I have ever seen." And that's actually the worst episode of the Stargate I've ever seen. It's horrible, and it comes from a person with a stargate in her basement. <br /> <br /> Make it happy to sell all my stargate props, most seriously.
