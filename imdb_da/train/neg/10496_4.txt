Gday Mates! So just Croc Hunter movie. It was okay, but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with more fun lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! In reality, you know it hurts. and can't they jump up loud? All of them are grabbing them by the tail and things. There were two large explosions in this movie. When Terry finds the baby joey, she goes like "We need to care for them, like a baby". Woah! I thought she would come up and breastfeed it. however, it would make it PG-13 itself. While at Terry, someone on film and much of the show Terry's knowledge of ritual mating. She knows her sex stuffs. film takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo and joey! Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one that turns out to be useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone else sees this, try to agree with me to say that the country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RET in the shotgun croc. he ate her gets !! I would also be angry
