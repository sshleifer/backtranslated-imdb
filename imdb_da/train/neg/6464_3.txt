Seeing Marlen Brando on the screen is like watching a master carpenter emailing intricate details in a piece of mahogany. Brando's play is the only thing that makes this movie appear. The reason is inan and ridiculous (not cartoon). The other big name actors seem to make desperate attempts to give the characters they show some modicum of humanity ... these signs have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either mediocre or simply horrible. The director shifts freeze-frame and slow-motion shots with impunity. The random music is cartoon-like and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the closet was far away. The venerable Brando couldn't take the focus away from the horrible carpets they had decorated him. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... neither is it. David Lynch films are carried by vicious creativity - this film was by no means creative. And don't mix confusion with stupidity.
