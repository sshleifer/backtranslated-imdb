I don't know much about Tobe Hooper or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he shouldn't have bothered it. As another commentary mentioned, there is not really enough horror or eroticism to bring fans of either genre. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are free, and most of the play is uneven. Englund did her best with weak material, and Zoe Trilling has a really good bottom, but it is not enough to wear this film either. This is a tape-over. Degree: F
