"The Man In The Attic" is a film set in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that didn't really have to be told. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the people who were responsible for packaging the film tried their best to make this movie seem steamy and erotic. They use terms like "illegal passion", "forbidden affair" and "unlimited pleasures". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun! The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappy with a gentleman who owns her own business. Edward (Harris) is employed by his husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other. The supposed "shocking" part of the movie is this: Christ's husband finds out the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up having Edward live up to their ceiling. Wow! Krista ends up seeing another and Edward becomes extremely jealous. So on and so on. <br /> <br /> "The Man In The Attic" does not cover any new territory. It is an original image in Showtime explaining why the stars are a pair of B-list actors, and both appear briefly in the cache. <br /> <br />
