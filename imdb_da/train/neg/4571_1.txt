What the ink we know is a deceived and random look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named) who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific way. Their interviews are chopped up in aggravating small segments and spread through some flashy cgi and banal mini-plots. <br /> <br /> The film manages science, philosophy, theology, and politics themes, brings them together without regard to accuracy, and somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult answer that the filmmakers would like to point out. <br /> <br /> These are knights and logical non-sequitures. How did we begin quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mystery? It's like saying 'two plus two is equal to four, so I can move objects with my mind'. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original in this movie and almost nothing is accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy editing, intrusive and meaningless special effects and general lack of substance. Educated viewers will be frustrated by tears of violence to science and all other issues that this film touches.
