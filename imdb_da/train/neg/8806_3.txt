How did this ripoff of "Being There" ever be so loved? People say it's a proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The movie is proof that luck is everything: Hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not Atari; hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks; hope that you will not die of shock when you are fortunately shot in the hams and not in the back; Hope you don't get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary - anyone who rebel against the social convention loses their legs, makes drugs, beats their girlfriends or dies young. In addition, product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulating movie that is very, very empty.
