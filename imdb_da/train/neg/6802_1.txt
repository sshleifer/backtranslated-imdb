Words cannot describe how bad this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You also have to see it for yourself to address how horrible a movie can really be. Not that I recommend you do it. There are so many clich√©s, bugs (and any other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the technical first there are many faults in the plane. I don't want to list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They did not even manage to show an airline in the colors of a fictitious airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing life. Very bad. The reason is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count of it really early. I was also on the evil side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive Decision" should undoubtedly be your choice over this, even the "turbulence" files are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.
