It was great to see some of my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They didn't get any signs or good lines to work with. I didn't understand or cared what the characters did. <br /> <br /> Some of the minor female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small side kicks. They showed some talent and it is boring that they did not move on to stars in more and better movies. Unfortunately, I did not believe that Dorothy Stratten was given a chance to act in this only important film role. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some fans and I was very outspoken when I started to see it. I am a great Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, "Cat's Meow" and all his early from "Goals" to "Nickleodeon". So it really surprised me that I could hardly stay awake watching this one. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this film is about a detective agency, where detectives and clients are becoming involved in one another. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-boyfriend Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called "Moonlighting" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in that the series was dependent on tons of witty dialogue, while trying to do with slapsticks and a couple of helixes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's not a Paper Moon and only a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
