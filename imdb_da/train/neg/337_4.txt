Well, what to say? The golden child falls into the "so bad, it's good" category. Eddie Murphy has some fun (and sometimes rather annoying lines), but you're still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain Sardo Numspa (which of *** ed calls is this ??). Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... hard to say, but my best guess is people who like embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and even more embarrassing dialogue. 4 out of 10
