My God, this movie is terribly boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie I expected a romantic drama and some good performances from Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but she is not really an actress for this role, she is too good at Rade Serbedzija. The romance between Gershon and Serbedzija's characters is too convincing. And I absolutely hated Serbedzija's character (a winnersman organizer), he's not charming in anyway in the movie. How did Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) beyond my understanding. Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job on this role, but they don't have the European ish I guess. In some way, I was so sad to drink the movie. If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, look out Bound, her best movie so far. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is so undervalued, and she deserves better chance than this, I want her to make a better choice in the future.
