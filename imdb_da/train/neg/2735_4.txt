I thought it wasn't the best re-cap episode I've ever seen (though my viewing partner gave me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment ... * sigh *). It was great to see Cox outside the incessantly crispy "Coxism State" he is these days for only brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes contained in the length of the character's hair (or height, in the case of JD) and youthfulness in the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach could be well on his way to a very Chevy Chase / or is it Matthew Perry? chat case induced chemical slide (already recognized at Conan). A small side note, the song (now stuck in the head) from the watchman induced dance montage was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
