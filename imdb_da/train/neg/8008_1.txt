For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot 'was much better. For Nastasia Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges ('CrissCross' and 'A World Apart' can't even be compared to this one) and Goran Bregovic for a version of the same musical theme from 'Queen Margot' to this movie (note the end of the movie). If this was an American pop movie, I wouldn't feel surprised at all; But for a European film with several independent actors and directors, a similar common approach to child abuse without original insight is very simple and disappointing. There are the bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are the poor children who hate people who sell them and are waiting to be saved by someone. And finally, there is the great hero who kills all the evil guys and saves these poor children from evil. Each character is shown in simple black and white expressions: the good against evil. From the beginning I could also understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the story of child sexual abuse? I think the difficult issue of child abuse and pedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original film. I think this movie wasn't disturbing but very disappointing.
