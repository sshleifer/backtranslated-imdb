This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and get bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Excuse me, Michael. The camera was dark. All the other players are unknown. When you see it, it feels like a soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual overtones as it is about an underground S&M killer. The action was bad, except for Michael Madsen's parts. He looked as if he would laugh. I hope he was paid well for this miserable movie. That's something I wouldn't be proud of. It's not even a B movie for cable, it's more like an F, and it should never be shown ever.
