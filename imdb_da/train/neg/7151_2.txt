I'm proud to say I've seen all three fast and terrible movies. Surely the plots are a bit stupid, and they can be a bit cheesy, but I love them car chases and all the beautiful cars and the secret midnight races. And I would like to see a fourth. <br /> <br /> Want to know what the difference is between the three and Redline? Decently functioning, somewhat thought-out plot, even though they are potboilers, and last but not least, directors who all three were made by very competent directors, all took the films in a different direction, equally exciting. Redline seems to have chosen a dozen women, he slept on the couch and got them for extras, then picked up his leaders from Hollywood's unemployment line. And the script. Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. This is the 70s made for television movies bad. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie had a few cool cars, but you really don't see many in action, and the action is so bad you can't be excited by chases, a d if the cars don't span You, why go in a movie like this? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a bunch of teenagers, and I can't stop laughing loudly. I get dirty, but this was just a debacle. Rent the R&F movies. Go to the Nascar Race. Go a karting track and run yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline as bad cheese.
