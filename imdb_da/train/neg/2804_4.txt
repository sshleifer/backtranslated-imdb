I've probably been spoiled by first and foremost viewing the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I didn't get any chemistry between the two main stars. A lot of staring and theater acting just doesn't work for me, and what was it all about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. Had the casting director actually ever read the book. Very strange! He's a great actor, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zelah was just good, strange, a bit of a mixed couple. In his favor, the support casting was pretty good, and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall, none of the novel's magic catches. Certainly would not ask anyone to see it as a true adaptation of the novel. A really let down!
