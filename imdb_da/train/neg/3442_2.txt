I rented this movie solely because the cover appealed to me. But as soon as the movie started, I was sorry. It seems that they used a home camera to shoot this movie and let a young child do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could have put it together myself and made a better piece of it. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, I felt it had some really good ideas, but because of risky lines and in some cases they were overshadowed. It had no direction. I didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to see it, but I'm always done with what I start so I took a deep breath and let it continue. Absolutely 98 minutes of my life wasted. <br /> <br /> Knowing that you've seen 'Haunted Boat' and finding something more entertaining would save you embarrassment. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but it was a big disappointment I thought nothing could get worse after 'Terror Toons', but it made me reconsider. One failed for his genre. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (The star is for the ideas of getting their worst fear for them)
