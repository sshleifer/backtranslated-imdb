What is it? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and overtly racist music, among others) unimpeded by any kind of narrative or plot or character development. It all struck me as a self-conscious "freak show", and I mean not only the unusual cast decisions. It has the feeling of a bad acid ride, far beyond any level of drug use one could attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second biggest favorite movie all the time), which was the intention much more depressing, but I still found what is it? a total waste of my time. It is one thing to give me an insight into the other's inner work - even someone else's chemically altered consciousness - but another to just throw nice pictures on me solely for the sake of amusement.
