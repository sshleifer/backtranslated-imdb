This film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a much sought after topic ... the extinction, the mystery, etc. It all had to be a good piece of film making, but ultimately fails at all. It's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, a lame erotic movie. 2 disc DVD contains a beautiful booklet with still images, interviews, essays on bestiality etc. and an extensive interview with the more than predictive instructor. For those who have heard about it, but never seen it, the package will work great until you actually see the movie. disk 1 contains the edited movie, poorly translated into English but with good visual quality. disk 2 contains the director's cut in a terrible transfer in French. What can I say about the actual animal? a puppet of Kermit would have been more effective and shocking.
