This part of the Masters of Horror was horrible. Apparently Mr. Carpenter needs to learn one or two things about pacing and decent, likely dialogue. There were times when I literally called on the TV for something to happen. Maybe he thinks he's building excitement, but Carpenter has to trim the exaggerated, simplistic musical score of his (or his son's) and speed up the action a little. How many times did the girl say, "Oh no, I can't have this baby!" and "Oh, no here it comes"? Carpenter takes items from much, much better movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them in here as if we were to recognize and appreciate his trademark style. What is missing here is true excitement and energy. It is as if he is sleeping through the process of film making. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, stick to the tried and true classics - The Thing, Halloween, and They Live. For better masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in Witch House.
