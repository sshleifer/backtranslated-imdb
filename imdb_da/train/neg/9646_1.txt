Lack of content in this movie surprised me most. First I though people would compare this to Rock On! but I am really surprised to say that this was worst than Rock On! Uneven story Terribly cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin, you must fool me. The music was okay Khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not yet learned from Singh's critically-based comedy. Now Asin .. where does she come from apologies for Asin's fan out there, but she sucks * d great time in this movie seriously ill-acted she doesn't look good on any overdose of makeup! You should see my final judgment with Aladin with your family instead of wasting your time here.
