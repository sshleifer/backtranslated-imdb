If Mr Cranky had judged this, I would be tempted to just copy his notification and insert it here. But as he does not, I have to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent. But not even can he save this movie from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he was working on this one, because only a conglomeration of scenes was thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad 70s. Even worse, both the actors and the director seemed to make it up when they went together, which probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth discussing the story, even though it is a futuristic company called Proxate Corporation, which put together a crew member of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container / slave ship to Nigeria. This ship's computer is a baby held in a glass jar and led to one of the crew via USB 12 or something. The company should have been called Prostate Corporation, as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with a survey of the same name. I honestly can't find a scene I could say was well made and made a real feel for the movie. I only saw it to the end when I had a touch of bird flu, and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I will not hold this against him as he is a great actor and every great actor is entitled to a bad movie in their career and this is a doosie. So unless it is the only movie you have to rent out or you are male and you are a doctor, do not do prostate tests this week and somehow feel that this is a bad thing, then give this A really wide berth unless of course you are jointly, you can buy a copy in support of Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster.
