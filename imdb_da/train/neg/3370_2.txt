Just a stupid old movie. First Stanwick's son gets his foot caught in a really stupid way, and her husband gets his foot caught in another really stupid way. In an attempt to save him, Stanwyck becomes unlucky, once again, and comes across a fugitive convicted. She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very stupid way. In the end, her husband is rescued, and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the stupid message of the movie is. Everything is good than ending stupid. <br /> <br /> I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever did it as a leading lady in Hollywood's glamor-oriented Golden Era; the nose is so beautiful ?? So photogenic ?? The film is mercifully short and runs just over an hour. It's as if the director has discovered that he made sheds, so he thought it was best to keep crap cards.
