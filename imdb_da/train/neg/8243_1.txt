The word in the summary summarizes it.) Five girls are lost and try to find their way home when they stop in a store to get directions, they hit a parked car that breaks a headlamp onto it, they are flipping the scene in fair to come in problems, but suddenly they see a headlight coming up behind them (ooooh). From there, everything cries and cries when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlamp;) and the screaming and crying remains pretty much throughout the movie (very annoying) The movie is shot, with a cheap camera that tries to make it seem like "real" or "shocking", I think it's just embarrassing and useless. In the absence of anything better to compare it to "Blair witch style". <br /> <br /> Screaming and crying for just about the whole movie with crazy sound was over the top annoying, you literally get headaches :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but it wasn't scary , just an annoyingly painful part of the crap film.
