Okay ... so I've seen many really weird / unusual movies in my day. Fear and disgust in Las Vegas is going to think when I think about it. Well no longer ... from here, when someone asks me, "Hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the start of the movie, it was obvious that this was one of the "trippy camera effect" films. Thus, I mean small things like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and fast forwarding of people's words and scenes, brass with the color of the screen, flash forward and flashbacks constantly ... then you have the actual action itself. People randomly become violent, shoot things / people, say the weird things that just don't do much if any sense. <br /> <br /> The film is about a writer who begins to mix real life with the book, he is writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see this "turn" he continues in the entire movie. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his journey was entertaining to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a really hard time, even ended Slipstream. It's a little bad for my brain. <br /> <br /> I can see some movie birds claiming this movie that has certain film shades that make it not only unique but adds them to the feeling of dementia ... blah blah blah. Point is, this movie hurts your brain when you see it .... it makes very little sense, it takes your whole concentration to even try to understand what is happening and even at the end, all you can be glad it is over ... and you can say that you actually sat through it! So in the end, if you want to see a movie that makes you say "what the heck" over and over again both high and in your head, go and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out. <Br /> <br /> Hopkins while applauding you as an actor and recommending your choice to take a stack by looking .... please make a movie like this again. Next time, try something that depends a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with headaches.
