I rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt complied with. Night Listener is undoubtedly one of the most hidden films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing going on in this movie, what ever - I didn't care about any of the characters who didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot, didn't care how it ended. ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no excitement, no excitement, nothing. The highlights include (no spoilers - there is nothing to spoil): A man climbs through a window, a dog barks outside a hotel room, a car that goes over a rough ground and a truck beeps that horn. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and hoped for a similar scary role from Williams, but unfortunately it was very let down. What is more disappointing is that I'm sure there is a good movie in there somewhere - the idea was interesting, and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> I may have even given it 1/10, but that score is reserved for The Producers remake
