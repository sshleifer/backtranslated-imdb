I can't believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really wouldn't even consider this true sci-fi. Every episode I have been through was like a lame, emigrated version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that could make it interesting or exciting. It is basically a bunch of people standing around in ARMY fatigue, talking about something boring, which occasionally goes through the Stargate and ends up on a planet that looks like the earth, with people resembling humans! It seemed extremely low budget. The characters are all forgettable one-dimensional cuts, and the many attempts at humor fall flat. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be fun, but he is not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was also horrible. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, but every place the ARMY people go is to carry! This shows no imagination! I actually thought the TV series "Alien Nation" from a few years back (based on movie Alien Nation) was much better. The show actually had good story lines and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation" but in comparison to this overrated crap it was amazing! Unlike the great new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame film too tightly! They should at least have updated the cheesy "toilet flush" special effect when someone goes through the Stargate.
