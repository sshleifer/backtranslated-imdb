Oh, brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous movie for over ten years, all I can think of is the old Peggy Lee song. <br /> <br /> "Is that all there is?" ... I was just an early teenager when this smoked fish hit the US. I was too young to get into the theater (though I managed to sneak in "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a screening waved at a local film museum - Finally, I could see this movie, except now I was as old as my parents were when they skied to see it !! <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie was not condemned to the anonymous sand's time was because of the obscenity the case triggered by its US release. MILLIONS people flocked to this stink and thought they should watch a sex movie ... Instead, they got lots of close-ups of gnarly, repulsive swedes, street interviews in gentle shopping malls, asian political president ... and weak who cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, holy grail, historical artifact. Whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, and put the box in a lead box! <br /> <br /> Elite estates still scrape to find value in its dull pseudo-revolutionary political spikes. But if it wasn't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, so forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the "I Am Blank, Blank" rhythmic title is repeated indefinitely for years as a title for porn movies (I'm curious, lavender - for gay movies, I'm curious, black - for blaxploitation movies etc.) and every ten years from the dead rise to be considered by a new generation of suckers who want to see the "naughty sex movie" as "the evolution of the film industry" ... Yeesh, avoid like the plague. Or if you need to see it - rent the video and quickly reach the "dirty" parts just to get it over. <br /> <br />
