Everyone in a moment makes Disney one of the three movies that surprise everyone. One who keeps you wondering all the way to the end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie is certainly a ghost, killing and raping your village. It's terrible. If you want a mindless, pointless, predictable "action" movie, go ahead. I think young children can enjoy this as they like it when good always wins. But I like movies where it is a throw up, who should win. This movie never leaves the bad boys overhand. In the end, when there are heroes in an "inevitable" pit, you just know they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he must never think about a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. Watch this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to watch good acting or a good movie. Go see a superman movie, it would be much shorter and the kids would like it more. For example, the scene where Cage escapes from armed firearms and bullets is all deflected by a railing of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just a little bit) This movie shows the fall of movies and the movie industry into cheap gags and boring, unrealistic action that this movie provides in large quantities.
