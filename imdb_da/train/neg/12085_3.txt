There really is not much need to start this little review with a plot synopsis. I think it's Shakespeare's Hamlet for the sake of goodness ?? probably one of the most well-known players ever written. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet as most people on IMDb have ?? through the Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the show may not be the best place to use to judge a movie, in this case I cannot imagine trying to see it without comic quips. In one word, this German, made-to-TV version of Hamlet is boring. 152 minutes? No way! It is too dark and depressing to be something I will spend almost three hours on. I have said it any number of times, but entertainment is the thing for me. And this wrist-wear is far from entertaining. However, I will give it a few points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting. A 3/10 sounds like me right. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet more tasty. There are a few good riffs here and there, but generally Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any kind of rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts me, I must give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
