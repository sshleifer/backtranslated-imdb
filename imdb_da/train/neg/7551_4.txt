Now we must finally see the remake last night in London, unintentionally fun, sexless and without real humor. I don't really know where to start while being entertained by this weird greeting, it didn't really move me. The action is screaming hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are too 'Disney' which is a ridiculous 'six months later' paste after the burning of Nic Cage (which didn't come soon enough for my taste) Bitten with Cage in the bear The cost had the audience suppressed joy, just as the comedy came out of various 'evil' on the island. It's such a strange remake that I can't believe I saw it reminded me of something that The Strip Strip would have made in the eighties, like their Hollywood interpretation of Miner's Strike, very strange!
