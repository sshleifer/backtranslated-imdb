I watched this movie with my climbing instructor and we found the whole thing ridiculous to be dissatisfied. (For one, if Stallone is out free climbing by himself, there is no reason to carry any gear, but I think the trembling carabiners see sorta "mountain climbing" so let's throw them in). For the lobotomized people who believe that Colorado sees something like the Dolomites in Italy (where the film was filmed), the Hollywood magicians have got much more ridiculous and foul-smelling things to swallow.
