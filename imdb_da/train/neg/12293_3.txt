This will only be bashed because it's stars David Hasselhoff. Well, let me bash it. Compared to the garbage they call horror today, this film is not so bad. It has beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super warm, but can't speak very well. There is a fantastic scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff. 3.10
