What a horrible movie. Rat tomatoes had a good rating for this too. Don't be fooled by the positive comments; It wasn't scary. It was not funny. It wasn't wise. It won't even keep your attention. I just wasted 2 hours in my life at this crap party. the computer-generated monster was interesting to see the first few times. after approx. 15 minutes it was no longer entertained. The dialogue was horrible, must be a translation thing. Another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans. 3 was depicted and they lacked all signs, intelligence and judgment. Now I have to write a few lines to the pillow when we need to have 10. The video shop staff should have hit me to bring this title to the disc.
