I found this movie to be an interesting study with cause and effect, but a little more than that. The plot follows the lives of a handful of people, and how their actions (conscious and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film holds great promise, but I feel it does not deliver on its promise. Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. As a result, I never got a true feeling for any of the characters and have never had a good relationship with them emotionally. At the end of the movie I had a "so what" attitude to them all. A stronger direction in character development would have made this film great, but as it stands, it is only half-yearly
