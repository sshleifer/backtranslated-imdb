I went to watch this movie on the theaters, and I was shocked when I entered the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! This cried to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, the movie was gloomy. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It's a very predictable story with him being in love with the girl who hates him. His plays are okay, but for the film's comedy aspect he is not very good. The baseline is poor, and the comedy is almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will stop other people wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I got out of the room !!!
