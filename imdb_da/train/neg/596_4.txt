Basically, here we have just a little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970s classic kitsch horror 'Death Line', which ironically was like this cobblers, also partially filmed at the disused Aldwych metro station. <br /> <br /> Make good use of the now interrupted anniversary line platforms at Charing Cross as well as the aforementioned Aldwych, this movie basically contains the same plot - dodgy mumming food zombie in the tunnels that characterize the lost passengers who have missed the last Train - Originality is not this movie strong point. <br /> <br /> In fact, strong points are missing. Gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessary over the gory, while the sub-Gollum nutter is never quite properly explained, which seems a little more than an underdeveloped plot unit. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has a bit to do with a thin script than dropping a lot of tunnels and screams all so often, in fact she was just like anyone else in this movie, out of action by a little dog and a pack bitch rats. <br /> <br /> If scary movies on the London Underground are your bag, or you just want to play spot tube location, they choose this on DVD when it hits a box. If you're looking for classic horror, dig a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a quality well-written and traded movie, you will need to change trains .....
