I tried to watch this movie three separate times. The night I rented it. Come through approx. 20 minutes and hope it would be better if I had a night's rest. Looked 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how stupid it was ... It wasn't even funny silly, sometimes a funny movie to watch, but this movie was just shit with a capital S (if you know what I'm believe in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I saw over an hour of the stupid thing, and I didn't enjoy a moment! Not even one. How was this script green-lit. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> 1/10 - one is for cheerleaders ... at least they deserve something for all their hardwork.
