This must be the WORST movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD and it didn't work, it was good, the DVD worked fine, it was just the movie, it was actually not so bad that I think the non-actors have worked since (or before you judge from the actor). There is no real plot to talk about and no real horror. The production values ​​are bad even for a low budget film, where some external scenes are difficult to hear due to wind on the microphone. All in all, it was so bad a movie that a viewer could think it was going to become a porn if they didn't know anything better (which has been an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are fun, both of which are about the transvestite prostitution. (Though they hardly deserve to see all 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As for marketing the DVD, I feel thoroughly cheated. I mean reading my back, I expected to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He chose his victims. He chose his nose. He turned into a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be fun. Also the case claims that it is digitally re-mastered, I would love to have seen it in advance, the print is so grainy you could use it as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolutely disgusting film, WHAT WAY?, Disgusting production that is acting. <br /> <br /> This movie remains welcome for the first five minutes (if you are considering buying this I would say buy `bad taste 'instead of being a much better movie and am funny, it also has Peter Jackson LOTR's director in it. <br /> <br /> By the way, if anyone knows anything about any of the players (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then write it here that I would love to know only to find out if there is a worse movie out there or if someone in this movie ever has trouble learning how to act
