There are some elements that hide this movie from being a total disaster, but are overshadowed by bad plays, plot holes, deus ex machina thrown ins, stupid dialogues, weak writings, and predictable clichés ... <br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror movie with a story that doesn't go anywhere for most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black guy who gets it first (yes, the cliché seems to be still very alive even in Finland), seems to have trouble trying to finish a mysterious empty hospital. There are screaming ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I at least thought they didn't use zombies, but they came), and Finnish glam-rock bands with demonic make-up to get in the way. There is also some time shift doodle present, but it adds nothing to the story. Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of deep life teaching thoughts such as: "What happens ..." or "Light cannot live in the dark ..." or the evil "I need a red crayon ... red crayon". So all these signs (including anxious father and sweet doctors in distress types) end up running around them dark floors and from or mistakenly to the demons. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies pops up, and if it seems that a demon keyboardist can't spot a group of six people coming against it, waving a flashlight and conversing, it just happened. And apparently, this demon can break through the walls without much trouble, but opening the elevator gate goes beyond its capabilities. In the end we even get a "turn" of everything. Or maybe it wasn't. Oh, boy, I wish this movie was, and the kind that gives time seems to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so ...
