Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man (John Carradine) dies and leaves everything to his four children, and his servants are equally divided. One condition - they have to spend a week in their property to get the money. And if any of them die, the others get more. Guess what happens next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a whole new version of this movie on cable. The colors were bright and vibrant and the house itself looks beautiful. It's all about the good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Let us mention some of the problems this movie has: the killer is screaming blatantly; The waiters are called Igor and Elga - come on! some of the sound recordings were so poor that I couldn't do the dialogue (no big loss, I'm sure); Gore was sparse and very poorly done; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains some really abominable plays - so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief. Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only pretty good play was from trouper Faith Domergue (who deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and weak here). However, I must admit - the final line of this movie is a gem! Why this was renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there is another screaming movie from 1978 with that name! </ br /> <br /> Whatever the name is, it's a bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
