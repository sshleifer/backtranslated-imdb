The movie starts with some rolling text that takes almost five minutes. It provides the basic summary of what is going on. This could easily have been done with acting, but instead you get a rolling text effect. Shortly after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, remember this is EVERYTHING you want to learn about them. The ground begins to come out of the ground and then break down throughout the film. Not only does the plot change, but you can even ask yourself if you see the same movie. I have never played video games but know people who have. From my understanding of whether or not you have played the game, this movie does not get better. Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.
