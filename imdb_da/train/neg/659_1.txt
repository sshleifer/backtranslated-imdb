This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment industry. The idea that the audience paid to watch this movie (and as an idiot I rented the movie) also counteracts. Obsessed teacher (3 years earlier) kills teenage family because he wants her. He never kills mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad action and direction. Years later, the occupied teacher breaks out of prison. HMM - usual bad writing - nobody in the city he terrorized knows at the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff people out and with a knife is super killer. Of course!!! Now obsessed teacher kills the hotel girl for no reason, knife bellhop for the fun of it and start chasing the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to make the girl love you. Obsessive teacher sneaks out of the hotel --- again it is stupid, the police would ever know his face - but he goes straight to them. Now he kills two cops outside the teenage house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills his girlfriend. There is not a single positive thing about this piece of waste. If another profession excluded work of this low quality, they would be fired. But these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and control this garbage can.
