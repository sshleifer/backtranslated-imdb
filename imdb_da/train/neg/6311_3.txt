It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> For people, a realistic movie is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, unpleasant, trivial, meaningless, sometimes. Maybe that's why people say this movie is real. For many common places: you are black, you are a criminal you are doomed and cursed, whatever you do end up shooting or being shot by someone; Don't let the kids play with weapons, it can be dangerous; And then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... Before this I had not seen such a bad movie. Perhaps that is why I have never noticed the importance of photography itself in a movie. In this one, each scene is shot during the day, outdoors, clear and annoying blue. They did not even correct the color balance. Oh! I have "rated" more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
