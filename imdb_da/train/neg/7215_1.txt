This movie was a stupid piece of shit. Bad everything. Why is it that we who love western movies get the jilt nine out of ten times when they rent western. It seems that if you can't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it's not worth cheating on. Mostly, the main activity of Shiloh Falls took place in 1892, but the revolvers used were 1860 models. Even the slider was bad - in one scene the marshal flew his six shooters about nine times and couldn't hit any of three big men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after approx. 15 minutes of this inity. Perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at Sunset Carson School of Acting.
