Of course, this little show is somewhat stupid little prequel / spin off of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the live action series, this show is completely crap. The live action show had intelligent jokes and stories. While the animated series is basically a tinted down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest, I might think the kids are doing this wrong. The story of each episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. It is basically the idea of ​​each episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Save and Save to become Sabrina. So, pearl becomes a witch and hypnotises harvery to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre yet interesting scene, where Gem says "just love me for now" and harvey knocks on his hands and knees and starts kissing his feet like being a god. (which is quite right since he is her mind control slave) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or effort.
