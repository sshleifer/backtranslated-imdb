Really a horrible movie. It can, however, be expected. It's definitely a low budget: Nothing innovative, an actress (if you can call what she does "acting" that always has roles with nudity in a shower, a man in a rope cloth is almost modeled after predators , a cabin in the forest, etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, there are usually a few parts that are not so engrossed. For one, the black guy does not die when he is attacked (first time) and he is not even one of the first couple to die. But it's smaller. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist about Kat's experiments and Wes & Steve that I did not look forward. When Steve told Kat he knew what she was doing, I thought what he was saying and what Kat replied to. But when the creation revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised at the revelation of the revelation. It could be because of my lack of experience with the genre or that it is a really wise twist. <br /> <br /> Whatever, the movie is pretty bad and doesn't see it if there's anything better ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi flick.
