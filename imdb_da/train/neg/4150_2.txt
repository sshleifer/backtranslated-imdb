Oh it really is. I've seen movies that I didn't like anymore for some reason, but I've never seen a movie that just fails in every aspect of film making. Nor does it allow filming, in a way, Hercules in New York can be said to do. It's not the movie I like the least, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The play is the first to hit you. I have never seen a screen film outside of pornography. In fact, I have lots of pornographic movies that have worked like a wrong place better than this. It is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. The camera work is amateurish. The editing is uneven. I suppose they couldn't afford proper audio equipment, and that meant that every scene in a car (and there are many of them) have them running for about three miles an hour, and each scene is outside the same shovel (and There are many of them too) is actually taken from a study that again lends more to the bad porno vibe. The reason is uneven, as many have pointed out. I will defend vampires who go in daylight because even though it becomes popular with Nosferatu, it was never originally a built-in part of vampire myth. Speaking of vampire myths, the author had apparently read Carmilla, or at least seen The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about this, swaying from impressed that a movie, this scary has at least some hope for a gothic novel, I am very pleased with; or annoyed by his at best sledgehammer references and in worst case total dismissal of source material. At least, General is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> It will be two stars, but only because I can't bring myself to vote for a star for a movie that has or at least claims to have both vampires and zombies in it. Incidentally, I saw Lifeforce (another movie that has ghastly vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as this, and despite being a pretty flawless movie itself, a masterpiece really comes up for that. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not a movie so bad, it's good, or so bad is it fun, even full, in some way. It's just a mess and it's worth no time to look at.
