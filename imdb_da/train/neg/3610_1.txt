A patient escapes from a mental hospital, kills one of his users and then a university professor after he has arrived at the local college. Next semester, the late prof's replacement and a new group of students will handle a new series of killings. The dialogue is so clich√©d, it's hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. This is one of the cheap movies thrown together in the mid-80s slasher era. Despite killing the hero, this is just substandard junk. Horrible action, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible awful horrible !! "Splatter University" is just gunk to put in your video recorder when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest seeing your main band, it would be more entertaining. Go over it and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> Rated for strong graphic violence, profanity, short nudity and sexual relations.
