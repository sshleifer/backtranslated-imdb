I just watched this movie last night and it was still disappointed to be a person who had very low expectations to begin with. The most wise mistake in this disgust for a movie is that the main plot point (the guy was awake during the operation) had nothing to do with the outcome. It would be completed in the same way regardless. So what was the meaning of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice clothes against him, and he did not think that people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is quite talented and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just ridiculous from start to finish. I'm pretty sure if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel, you'd have more pain than that.
