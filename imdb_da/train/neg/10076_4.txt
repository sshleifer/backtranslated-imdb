The heavy relationship between this movie and the first fat is established right at the start of the film, when Didi Conn, one of four cast members repeating their roles, approaches young Maxwell Caulfield, a British exchange student. Although in the previous movie Olivia Newton St. John's foreign speech pattern is not explained, it is explained here Caulfield is her cousin. What makes Conn still in school, I think she just likes hanging around Rydell High, even though she is now a beauty expert. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a smart kid, so of course hood types are led by Adrian Zmed getting him labeled as a geek. And that's particularly bad when Zmed's girlfriends decide she likes Caulfield. But being a geek just doesn't cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to put a modern Zorro action. He gets an unwanted bike and puts it back together and learns to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If you do not get Michelle Pheiffer in the cards, Caulfield will have no trouble making friends of any gay leather bar as he is equipped. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths they both enjoyed. If you saw the first fat movie, a much better movie than you definitely have an idea of ​​how this movie will show up. In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles. The music score is not external as good as the songs that come from the original. It's not that Fat 2 is bad, it's just not that big.
