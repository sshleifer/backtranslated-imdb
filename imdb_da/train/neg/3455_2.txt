Geez! This is one of the movies you think you've previously reported, but you didn't. I mean, you didn't give anything, but somehow it came to you. <br /> <br /> To be honest and short; This is one of the worst, boring and stupid slashes ever made. I can't say anything good about this piece of crap, because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it are made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are terrible, bloodless, stupid. The reason is somehow good to consider that it copied "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, it's not a movie so bad that it's good. It's simply bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do his best, but it wasn't enough.
