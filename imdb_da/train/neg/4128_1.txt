This movie is one of the most horrible I have ever seen. Not only is the dialogue terrible, it never ends. You think it ends, but it's not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I know I will never see it again. It's as if someone took a romantic comedy, took out the comedy, then decided to break down the romance and left us with the pile of crap that managed to make way to the screen. But don't take my word for it, find out how horrible this movie is.
