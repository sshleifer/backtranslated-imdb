To preface this review, I must say I was a little curious about this movie. But I probably wouldn't have seen it if I didn't have my arm slightly twisted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie shows just how depraved a man can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about the whole Springer phenomenon is not the kind of people at the "Jerry Springer Show" action they do (which in themselves is extremely accusing), but that many people are so curious and eager to see them and hear about their lives (yes, it is assumed to include me .. to what extent it is true). If you do not glorify that kind of behavior (as some might say), we can at least undermine our thoughts and / or desenstizing ourselves for this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (kind). Here's the skinny: the movie has an R-rating, and although it can only deserve it (I looked away at some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I mean an NC-17 (the tip of the hat to the other reviewer) may be a little more appropriate for the huge sexual content (a cynic can comment that the movie was just a big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The reason is very bizarre, linking the stories of a completely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypically black disturbed, which will look at various Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves one with some resolution and jumping rhetoric about the need to see the real world (apparently as seen through his show). I agree with him there - it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to create positive change. That said, let me just tell you, the world's most beautiful look at a new paper or the news to see it, but let's not hand out good money to support the kind of sensationalist and perhaps formal titlition that Springer seeks to give us.
