I was disappointed. The film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype that was patched over the box. That said, the characters were well-developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise, and the house was pretty scary, but it just missed me. I was waiting for the big AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued with poor filming of bad special effects. Thus refers to much of a bad thing and does not use atmosphere and viewer imagination to create horror and excitement. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you're looking for a low budget but well-developed horror movie.
