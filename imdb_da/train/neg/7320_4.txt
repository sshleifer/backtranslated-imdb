A bondage, humiliation, S&M show, and not much else. The reason is flat, really just a banal setup for the stylishly bad set-pieces. The vestibule of the aforementioned show, a stupid little little man spitting drifting while bouncing around the stage in dresses, was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artificial editing. The dream-like ending felt dressed. For the film's credit, Aya Sugimoto, however, was quite convincing as the tortured lead. Flower and snake have been compared to Eyes Wide Shut, but Kubrick is, apart from some minor surface similarities, a more layered, artistic and atmospheric image.
