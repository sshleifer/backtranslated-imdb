SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out of the spinner, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she mistakenly thinks Jed has an affair with one of her two feline friends. Kate thought she caught them a blatant delicto. Kate throws Jeds shoes out of the door. Jed reluctantly leaves and then sits in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. Then he is driven over ("Crushed", one of the title's importance) of a truck. And die. <br /> <br /> "And then he is driven over by a truck." Can you imagine a writer actually sending a script with this plot element? Until then, it is a comedy that intends to be creepy, but lacks any real fizz. All but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed and everyone is sad until the end, where gals learn to love each other and be supportive, rather than destructive. I give it 2 ughs.
