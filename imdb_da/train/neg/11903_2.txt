Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I don't know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after SPT11 and the prospect of the American Society is hope, it makes it 2 out of 10. But it's not a movie. It is the best thing to do with a good idea (the Western Eastern clash). There are important things in the Middle East and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an American girl who is actually level with stupidity (because she is just ignorant of facts). The characters are not well formed. And most importantly, the idea given with religion is somehow fun for me. At the end of the scene, Lana says it's just quiet and trying to listen. And the background music says "... I want to pray". It's not about religion actually. But it ends with that. How do you see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray. The lights are already shining on the truth. It's just that no one wants to see it. ps: "My home is not a place. It's people." The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that phrase. But it is wasted behind this film production. (By the way, as "anyone" mentioned below is America's finest young man not finest, they are just the "poor" and the "hopeless" ones signing up for the army who need good payslips not provided by the government!)
