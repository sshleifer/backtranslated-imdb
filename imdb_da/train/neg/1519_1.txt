I only lasted 15 minutes before self-preservation pushed me out of the empty eye boring stupor that this movie effortlessly induced and drove me to scream back to the video store armed to bear. <br /> <br /> To say the movie was bad, it would be a missed opportunity to use words scattered with characters from the top keys on my keyboard (just to keep those comments clean). <br /> <br /> One to be avoided. <br /> <br />
