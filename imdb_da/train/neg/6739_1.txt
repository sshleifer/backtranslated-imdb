One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie clips that have already been seen, as is the case with this movie. The "Wedding Day" is one of the best examples of why not even try to reintroduce, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been abandoned. If a project like this goes ahead with the study of great honko's approval, then go all out with big stars and blank production values, so people will come to the stars. <br /> <br /> That's not what happens in this misunderstood comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screenwriters have transplanted the story to London, as it basically seems to be a typical American situation that will not even be able to cope. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! When Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not drawn into the movie as the creators thought they would be. Obviously, Kat will fall to Nick and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in "Junebug", comes across as a low girl who is willing to keep her lying on the move and does not come to the man who loves her and wants to marry her. <br /> For all interested, the credits run at the end of the movie for almost seven minutes!
