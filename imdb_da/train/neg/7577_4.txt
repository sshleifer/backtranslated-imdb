This is just something appealing to fans of "bad movie" entertainment. It is worth more to students in the 1970s pop culture: fashion, furniture, attitudes and the great "women's lib" pattern in the early 1970s, when it was still fresh and novel for an independent, independent woman to exist. "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a monetarily rewarding if it stultifying career (after all, what is a flying companion, but a 30,000-foot waitress - also the male) she slept with more men, could protect herself and others (with karate) and were not tied to anything. It is the kind of emancipated woman who scared the juices out of anti-feminists, the retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is finished without a man. <br /> <br /> The "sexual stewardess" was a potent archetype of the late 1960s to the 1970s, (with "The Partridge Family", I remember swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid, constantly Stop stewardesses), and from this point of view, this stupid movie is an important pop culture time capsule of pre-AIDS, free love, women's lib, swinging seventies. However, the reason is quite awful. And for those cavemen in the audience, there are few just breasts to watch.
