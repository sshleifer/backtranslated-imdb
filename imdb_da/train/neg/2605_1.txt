Although I recently put this on my 10 worst movie list, I have to say it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or any of the "Look Who's Talking" sequels. Still, it is rather nauseating, even with sexy Drew Barrymore, who plays some of a horror movie response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York City to Los Angeles, but finds out that she is stalked by a murderous appearance. Poor Sally Kellerman, a quirky actress with great recognition in the 70s, has been reduced here to a poor support role, and Barrymore's leading man George Newbern is the worst kind of sitcom actor, and always laughs at each line. The picture is swill, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the psychic identity (though it's a "Scooby Doo" episode) is interesting. But as far as the finals are concerned ... will be real! Who had to clean up this mess? * from ****
