As a story nut that is particularly interested in this particular historic event, I was very disappointed with the movie. Granted, costumes and scenography were quite authentic, but the Hollywood depiction of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of movie footage dedicated to marching or parading troops must have been unprecedented in film history. Eveytime I heard triumphant background music begin, I knew I had to prepare for another demanding scene of pointless filler. Of course, the producers had invested heavily in "staging" and were determined to get their money's worth. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent cast, their dialogue was again dull and their characters were never developed. Every time Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I would cringe with disappointment. Their given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe they were the same two great actors portraying Lawrence of Arabia and Bird Man of Alcatraz. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this one is not much better.
