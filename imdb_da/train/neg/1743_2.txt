Unlike its title, this film does not offer any spice and thus the audience is exposed to a tasteful bowl. All humor seems to be forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of the Pakistani players' available video, including the way. Everyone screams, shouts and makes strange things for no reason. The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood's Boeing Boeing. John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all his films, is a complete misfit here. If we keep the moral factor aside, even the bizarre events look. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts, try hard to lift the movie by being natural but in vain. At least, the characters of three girls should be made contrasting to bring in some interesting elements, but unfortunately they also look all the brainless, buxomed bimbets (3Bs) that speak, behave and even scream in a quite similar way. The main hole in the plot is, what did the protagonist say that the three girls in the same home looked like they would never get to know each other? to do something sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore, so much drama zazi is something that the audience will easily digest. But certainly big meat shows and tempting promos always give uch movies a good start. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor at such a cinema certainly goes wild and denied to the extent that they connect to a sadistic, strange and crazy kind of humor, where it is not the characters they laugh at, but rather to themselves and only frustrations Who looks like we have become meaningless to bear with such things to laugh?
