The only reason I don't give this movie less than 3 stars is because it's not entirely in line with a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The film's biggest crime is that it is the main melting boring and terrible, unforgiving British. The prerequisite for this movie sounds potentially promising, the whole teleportation concept, but the direction they followed it was completely uninteresting. It was more a film about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers. The actors were wood, unemotional and remote. Like love affair between the two scientists - which was anything but exciting. I was never able to tell what the attraction was between them, as chemistry was non-existent. Nor did I really understand why the melting face of the chief decided to slaughter everyone he met. At least now I know that I should always give a fair hearing before I cut off their research grants, otherwise they go wild and kill involuntarily with stupid gestures.
