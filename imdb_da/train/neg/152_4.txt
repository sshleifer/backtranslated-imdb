You might consider a few facts in the discussion to be spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that voice. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such ... which I don't know about. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the end product.) Spilsberg's direction controls this is so constructed, so imperceptible. While watching this movie, a distinction occurred during a film course I had taken, yelling at me: "Delay is honest feeling honestly reproduced. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life." This is over-the-top sentimentality. When, in fact, two people begin to read aloud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when they sit on the bed and cross the letters from Nettie, have they found it? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the movie: all the men are crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping together as a bunch of birds leaving when she goes off; Harpo falls through the roof of various buildings he works on (a cheap slapstick gag); The whole troops of revelers go from Jook Joint a lot to the chapel, as if it is magically involved with the choir's singing ... on and again. Nothing bad true. I wondered if Harpo's name was chosen purposefully, because it is his wife Sophia's true name, "Oprah" backwards. Spielberg is not such a "cuteness". <br /> <br /> It's not that Spielberg is not capable of honestly reproduced action and emotions. Schindler's list was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I also admire Spar Private Ryan for its realism, though the story is a little bit constructed.
