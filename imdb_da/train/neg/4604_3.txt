I have to pat myself on the back to see this movie all the way because it really was painful. An uninhibited painter becomes a fully capable hitman? This movie was abundant with absurdities, if I mentioned them all, I would give away the movie. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a debris for agreeing to make this movie. The action was regrettable, and the story was even worse. As a sensible and rational individual, I could not understand where the author came from or where he went with this movie. There was opacity in each protagonist, there were a number of inappropriate and ridiculous events, so the film ended. An absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a movie, it only makes a flashy train wreck.
