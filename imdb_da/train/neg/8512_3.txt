I like quiet movies, but it was a little too moronic. As much as I could wish I could say it was worth the hour I got up, I can't. I don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book. And don't try it on children they can freak. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that labor laws were different since then ... BUT COMING ON PEOPLE.
