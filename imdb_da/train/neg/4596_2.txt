A question for you: A family goes to a new house and is disturbed by demonic forces. What movie am I talking about? Every horror movie you've seen? Yes it's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I want to narrow it down by saying that there are many teen anxiety scenes. Doesn't it help? Well, there are lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a being, and you see the characters through the POV of creation. No further forward? Okay, there's a dream sequence with lots of blood? Can still be any horror movie you say. Oh gawd this could take weeks so I'd say the movie I'm talking about features lots of aussies, many of which have appeared in the neighbors and at home and away. Yes it is true that the movie is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It's about me about how THIRD CIRCLE is definitely not different from any horror movies that are made
