I really want that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make fun. This is a movie you can sit through, but nothing special about it. After seeing it, you would say it was okay. It was not boring to see, but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. Entertainment must mean that you actually get something more than one or the other. history. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie" but instead succeeded. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 out of 10.
