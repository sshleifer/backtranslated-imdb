When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was so wrong. This movie was exactly like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this and other films is that the story is very week. These are bad actors and boring music. The picture is OK, but the rest is total crap. Don't watch this "horror" movie, go and see Ring 2 or another movie that is much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies that have a virus, and the virus spreads and makes people zombies. We've seen enough of it. The only good thing in the movie is when they stand on a roof and shoot famous, infected celebrities.
