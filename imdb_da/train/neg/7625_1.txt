This is your only spoiler warning. What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered "Oscar worthy". <br /> <br /> I share material in three levels. The first is the stage theater. Here the viewer is stagnant, and power rests in the actor's presentation and most importantly in the power of the author. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the words better. The best dramatists know how to make imagery that the tough stage cannot show. <br /> <br /> The second level is movie. In this medium, a weaker author can be used, but the viewer does not sit in one place all the time. With film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning beyond strong writing. In addition, movies can manipulate everday elements such as sound and color in ways that are almost surreal. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated into paper and then restored by the reader. Far more detail can go into a novel than it is imaginable for a film studio. <br /> <br /> Therefore, customizations can go up, but never down. Novelizations are never better than the base movie (see thousands in your local bookstore) while the movie cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can rarely be made into games and players can always be made in movies. <br /> <br /> As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails. It's a movie that must stick to the scene because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right. The characters speak the same thing and act the same, it is purely in vain. Add to that an unpleasant soundtrack and you have a completely opaque film. <br /> <br /> I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians. The instructor raved about how sad the movie was. What is sad is how such a stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is fun. Had this been in color, the scenes of the impotence, the pool party and the old hooker would be considered a great comedy. See what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti' a couple of years later. <br /> <br /> The US Higher Education System must start teaching movies rather than trying to learn with movies. Two visually powerful downbeat movies: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, not this. It's the 'last' I want to see of it. 1 out of 5.
