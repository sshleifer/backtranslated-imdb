The animation in this rendition of Peter and Wolf is excellent, but after 29 minutes the film is sleep inducing. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails" because everything goes at the snail's pace. I couldn't even see the movie in a meeting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torture. Save yourself 30 minutes - don't watch the movie - and you want to thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee only looked at the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the category Best Animated Short (short!), The voters have to sit through the whole case. I already feel sorry for them - and have to predict that this movie will not come close to winning.
