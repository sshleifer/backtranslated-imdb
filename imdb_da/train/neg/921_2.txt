I rented this to see Vanesa Talor again. She can act but doesn't get a chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is a comprehensive crane image of mountain landscapes. Must have come from a storage archive because the film is shot directly to video tapes. The production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects worth noting. This movie is bad but not fun. The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.
