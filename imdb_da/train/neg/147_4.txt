"Valentine" is another horror movie to be added to the stem and slash movie (think "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). It's certainly not as good as the movies I've mentioned, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "Friday the 13th" movie. One of these movies was the Canadian 1981 made "My Bloody Valentine" which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than one, but it doesn't say much. The reason: a nerdy young boy is afflicted and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the start of the film. Then the movie moves later, when the classmates have all grown up, then they are picked by one-on-one. The murderer is supposed to be the young boy who has now grown up and is seeking revenge. But is that him? Or could it be anyone else? "Valentine" has an attractive casting that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a missing script does not make them fair. However, there are some scary moments throughout. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
