The acronymic "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film derives the building of a "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic that will be used as an "air station" for transatlantic flights. Based on a modern Curt Siodmark novel; It was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, the technology made non-stop oceanic travel much more preferred. Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl instructed. Mr. Veidt is most fun to see; but he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Mrs Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The younger co-stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both the concept and the film have not lived well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
