What was with the sound? It sounded like it was all baptized. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = poor. Accents = Bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Acting = Bad, Harp = Bad, Six Scenes - Bad / Cringeworthy. <br /> <br /> Still we saw it to the end in disbelief. How could such a good role-playing of actors perform so badly? Will they ever get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Poor, bad, bad. By the way, we gave it 3 because at least we were enticed to see it to the end because of its bizarre plot, etc. And to the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s. How was it done in 2004? OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a lovely house in Bristol. Dougray had a nice boat. Jennifer looked good in a little outfit. But how did the sister come with all the men?
