This movie is horrible. I really looked forward to what I thought "Lantana" was amazing. <br /> <br /> The following review may include * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, the good things: it looks good, some of the performances Is ok. The bad thing is everything else about it. <br /> <br /> The story that you may know is about some blocks that fish and discover a body with the twist they find on Friday, but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they Comes back into mobile (mobile phone) range. However, the movie takes time to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> The ensemble of characters (about a dozen) does not seem to be another (which is, I suppose, consistent because they are all unlikely). I was extremely frustrated that it was not enough to explain how the characters are related, and it was only at the end of the movie that I could vaguely construct the family tree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a movie, we're incredibly gloomy, which is a mistake in the history of history as the character's life seems just as bad before the fishing trip as after. When you have set the bar so high, it is difficult to build - it is short for anyone who commits suicide. <br /> <br /> There is stupid drop in logic. The killer dumps the body in the lake, and then somehow it runs miles upstream into the mountains. The fishermen go out on Sunday morning, but Byrne comes home for some reason late in the evening after his wife has gone to bed. Then the first thing the next morning, the cops hit the door to get him down to the station. Um, they haven't heard of the phone? Down at the station do the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the body? <br /> <br /> Absolutely missing in history is the debate that the blockers probably had after they found the body. This is a mystery - everyone asks them "how could you do it?" and the audience asks the same question. (The debate on what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to go out to the car, drive to the mobile area, call the police, wait, and bring them back to the location. If the others are waiting for the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> Much of all this just seems wrong. The only thing true was that the local aborigines seized the fishermen's actions as a racist - when it was a black girl - would not have done so if it were a white girl. <br /> <br /> There is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once) and there is no mystery as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene. /> <br /> So I'm sitting there at the same time bored and confused when there's a twist - not in the plot, but the theme. Suddenly, it becomes about the deprived aboriginal quiet dignity that leads to a ridiculous ending with some incoherent things about black and white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is Australian movie "at its best," according to The Age.
