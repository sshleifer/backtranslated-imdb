In a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and TRYs to be something more. It will be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. It will be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it a sense of an important movie. The dialogue is smart - at times. There are some "laughing loud" moments. <br /> <br /> But here's what keeps it ultimately to be something more than a formal late night cable, in flight, the time killer: <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - how many times can Joe's sad-sack puppy dog ​​staring blankly in the room with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? Maybe some club would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - she's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role should be this lively, cozy, caring girl who just stays in the wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and therefore a harassment loses like Schwimmer any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very boring. Combine this with the puppy dog ​​drop face (above) and you have very little chemistry to worry about. <br /> <br /> (I held pictures of another in this role - Kate Hudson for example.) <br /> <br /> 3. The script and plot - the things that happen are simply not true ; all the problems are wrapped in the end with such a nice and nice bow at the top that it seems that a whistle blew and the scriptwriters just said "oops, time to unpack it, get a train to catch!" So they took out the Hollywood Formula Book, checked all the boxes and went home.
