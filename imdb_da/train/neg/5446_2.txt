For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to become creative and make this 80's video a bit of a sci-fi story that involved the evil barbarian villain the band got its name on. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some 80s Duran Duran songs find confusing and annoying cut scenes where the fictional antagonist is trying to stop the band on one of Their concerts. Not only is the good music interrupted repeatedly, but we have to suffer through a cheap photo story hosted by an evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to carry. 2.10
