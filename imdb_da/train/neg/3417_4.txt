Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excluded. I will try to tone this down. Let's be right !!! Nobody wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the protagonist. There was a good battle scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can't hang out with the best anymore. Has he slowed down so much that he has to show himself unwanted like this and hope his reputation will carry him throughout the film? Chuck is a great martial artist and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities into his movie, and one does not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, be the main character of your movies, because it doesn't work for you ... Gary
