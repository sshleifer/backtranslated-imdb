I just wanted to watch this movie once, when I was pretty young, so much of the movie is blurry trying to remember it. However, I can say that it wasn't as much fun as a movie called murderous tomatoes should have been, and the most memorable thing about this movie is the song and stage of the older couple talking about poor Timmy. Apart from that, the movie is really just scenes of small tomatoes and big tomatoes that roll around, and people act scared and overactive as people should do in a movie of this type. But just having a very stupid premise and a catchy theme song does not make a good comedy. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B-movie, nothing to be taken seriously, but you should still make jokes that are fun and don't try to extend a mildly entertaining premise to a full movie. Perhaps a card would have been fine as the trailer shows the older couple mentioned above, and a man who desperately tried to pistol down on a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they actually made a full movie and a pretty weak one.
