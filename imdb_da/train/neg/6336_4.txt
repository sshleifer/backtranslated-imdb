Updating the Bliss theme is just the latest in an extended queue of poor-to-average local comedies that appeal to the conservative cinema set. (For the record, this list includes all the movies that appear to be trying on a castle-esque miracle, Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honorable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes, and The Nugget. Having worked has been Crackerjack. ) <br /> <br /> Here, the show never goes together as John Howard doesn't even look like he's in the real movie ?? though it was supposed to be when Franklin plays sleepy, conservative suburbia against his more interesting inhabitants. 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents become rarer on the screen, but it's hardly a reason to watch the movie. In fact, the only reasons can be (1) Howard's bizarre ?? but totally fun ?? performance, and (2) the theme "suburban nightmare" which has undergone Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, Rage in Placid Lake, Travel Light, Teesh & Trude, Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good / excellent. Enter at your own risk! Must be one for people sitting at the word 'penis'. 10.4.
