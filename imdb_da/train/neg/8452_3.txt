This is the first time I have commented on a movie because I felt that if the right person read it, they could wake up and do something about it. Over the past few months, ABC Family began sending a new movie format. I've seen the last three and enjoyed them. They were engaging and did the trick. My wife likes these movies. I was looking forward to see "See Jane Date". Trailers looked and sounded good. Unfortunately, it is a movie in which the book should be light years ahead of the action shown by the authors and music people involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was just as interesting as a lift in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the movie. It worked against it. I work in movies and TV. I enjoy being entertained. This is a case where I continued to think, it could get worse. The scripture had lines from another decade, and I know these women can act, but you wouldn't know about this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. An advice to the Disney, ABC, ABC Family and Manufacturers Directors: Under no circumstances should you not hire the composer or music director to make any of your future movies. They have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word "contemporary", "contemporary" and "present" means when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world that passes by you. All in all, a huge disappointment from people at Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
