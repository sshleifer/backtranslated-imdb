If you look at this without getting an idea of ​​what the story is about, then you're in for the surprise. Even then, the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane story, but the actual film is anything but. As the synopsis went on, it tells of an obsessed mountaineer whom you will see as the prologue before the opening and the crawl, which tells of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of mind (note to itself spells problems with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal longing for a change in their ubiquitous. They can see our world and inform all people about this mountaineer, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent bullet to meet the man. <br /> <br /> What it translates into is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old child could produce. Have characters created, even though credit goes to the stop-motion style, and puts it through a mind-numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes begin to close and continue to the next scene. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this concept exists) really love their pegs and bullets that constantly play by confronting the magic sphere and having a market play with it before being released to the "other" world. It also does not get better when interacting with the ball in yet another hypnotic boring and sleep inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course, driving time is shorter than advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 listed. While it's poorly dated, its bad colors, non-existent history, scratched soundtracks and repetitive images will win over no fans. Don't waste time.
