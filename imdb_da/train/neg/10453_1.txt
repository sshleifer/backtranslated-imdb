This movie deserves more than one 1. But I give it one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 that results in it getting a rating that will take it in the top 100 list. Seriously, it's not that big, it's not that bad. It's a stupid cool classic with so many fricken fan boys, that's ridiculous. These are the types that are probably still laughing at Chuck Norris jokes and still say "I'm Rick James B! Tch" No matter how old or annoying it gets. I fear to hear "I'm tired of MFn snakes at this MFn plane" months from now on by idiots trying to be fun. Its crappy plot crap acting, etc. It's okay to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it's a bad movie. Wait for the marine John Cena to watch a real movie
