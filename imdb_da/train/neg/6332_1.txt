I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out when I was a great SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went to see it, the people who came out of the early show screamed, "Don't waste your money!" But of course we had to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> While there were a few fun pieces (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most felt that it could have been hard edited down to an entertaining 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When opera songs came on, many people stood up and went out. This made me laugh because I realized that O'Donoghue just pushed people's buttons intentionally on this movie. Otherwise he was just crazy. Whatever you don't have to waste your time watching it, it's so bad.
