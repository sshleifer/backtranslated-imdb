The back of the DVD (missed it when it came out) downloads Hitler-The Rise of Evil as "A Triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Not against the Post, but really, who ever wrote the word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of, ahem, art would be fired. <br /> <br /> I'm not something to start with. Why try to paint the picture of Hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? He was in good order, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and subdued way he treated women) and so on. The actors are good, so you have to be sad because they are imprisoned inside their one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he ended up playing an old and failed leader in a fake movie (or in this case television production to be precise). The first was of course the legendary galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This is OK if it is on telly and you have nothing else to do but believe me - it is best left on the shelf at your local Virgin store.
