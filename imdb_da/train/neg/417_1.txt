I come to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check this site, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on a movie. <br /> <br /> To my all time list of shocking bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spices, Bone Collector - I can now add the drive that was 'Hollow Man'. From the horrible opening titles - a ridiculously lengthy crawl of cast and crew paired with alphabetti spaghetti - through to abusive finals - a world record number of clichés and some of the most absurd dialogues and about making it to the cinema - this movie is gloomy And only the impressive computer graphics prevent you from going out long before the end. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion - it was for my friends and everyone around us. When large parts of an audience laugh and groan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the movie is hopeless. It was not only that, it was also sick. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film and into the riches of an excess blood B movie. It's hard not to imagine the instructor as a kind of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world only prolonged two attempts to get a sense of some breasts. Perhaps sex could be the first in a mind if it was made invisible, but apart from the ladies involved in aesthetic pleasures, it hardly makes entertaining cinema. <br /> <br /> [spoilers follow] <br /> Go past the movies ill exterior and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job of trading more and more like "hollow man", the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a crooked script - are an even better job of being hollow. One long time member of the team is found swollen in a closet by the invisible man, "He is finally beaten" pushing a colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course and the lab team turns between pure terror and complete indifference at such a speed that you wonder how they came to act. They throw their way through the lab corridors frightened, pistols cleared, but then seconds one of the crew miss missing out on the corridor to get blood to a damaged colleague. The leading woman treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humor even after he is offended and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts even after he drowned the Pentagon boss, "he drowned in his pool yesterday night "same female, spectacularly failed to put two and two together. <br /> <br /> The scripture is filled with this kind of ill-acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of movie clichés that are put on thicker and faster as the movie progresses to complete disbelief and entertainment at the end. <br /> <br /> The Eureka moment on the computer, the female dress by the window, the loop security video - the list is really endless - the predictable breach of power in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars, but just put those in a place of likely impending death and letting them into their own units, the closest dead good guy works out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and the ubiquitous landdown hours, the fireball explosion that just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling elevator that just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the evil guy. The invisible man is burned to a shed with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked around his head with a bar that had just cut directly through one of the smaller actors, and then apparently survived the explosion, fireball, and total destruction of The labs have more than enough lifespan to climb through the fireball to a last pop in the movie heroes - at which point the disbelieving crowd goes to watch and watch their watches. <br/> <br /> That exceptionally bad movie actually made it to the cinema is amazing. Even the film's name is just as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere to save this, which should be avoided at all costs.
