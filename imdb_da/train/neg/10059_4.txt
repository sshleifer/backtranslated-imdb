I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I looked at a man who ruled the fact that his grandfather lost his tobacco right to the Duke's family. And it went on and on again. If Mr. McElwee's family had ruled over the dukes, I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have problems with the death of tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee's family began the tobacco industry; I expected more than McEwee's ongoing focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the branches of the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco. The numerous references to the movie "Bright Leaves" are out of place - so what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee's grandfather? Does the viewer know some understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing old movie clips of a fictionalized movie? I did not do it.
