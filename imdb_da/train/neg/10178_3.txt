How have I ever appreciated this dud of a successor? All it does is throw balls! Worst of all, it does not compare to even the first part of the series! The comedy suffers from being fun. Where did all that unintentional laughter go? Enough slapstick on-the-field action takes place too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this from a complete nine-in. Shutout. What's next, MAJOR LEAGUE 4: BACK TO THE SMALL LEAGUE? Ehh, could be! Let this stand on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This one had three strikes for many.
