Describe the scene where a bunch of screenwriters sit on the table and say, "Let's get a black woman to turn to an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) on the street and ask him if he is black so go away" . The other authors are laughing hysterically until one suggests repeating it in each episode. More laughter. Now, if you think the premise is fun and the show contains many such situations, you'll enjoy this show. In the rest, you use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry. Those who have written glowing reports on this show must either come out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really fun. Another example of humor in the show is trying to get a girl out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginal fun the first time, but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples, but these can only be treated as spoilers that reveal why this comedy just isn't fun at all.
