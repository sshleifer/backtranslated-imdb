Wow! I remember so many horrible films that were loosely about high school from the early 1980s. They usually had a bit of strenuous plot and many 27-year-old actors pretending to be students. When I saw this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia's growth in the 1980s. But then I find out that this film was made in 1989? What do you say! Now the nostalgia factor ends right there, it's just bad. The site has the city to prepare to close a gymnasium and threatens to bus all the students to city school colleges. It's strange because the students at this school are both rich and abundant. In fact, the protagonist lives in a mansion. Do you wonder how they can not find money to keep this school alive, they have never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if students can raise $ 200,000. So seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise $ 200,000, but instead of saving it to college, do you set it to save high school that you are Senior in? And why would they just close an overcrowded school before the year is out? And ... ahh forget it, this movie was stupid and made in 1989!?
