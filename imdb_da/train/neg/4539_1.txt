I have never seen anything as terrible as this movie for some time. The movie was dull, long long and horrible plot. The special effects suck as hell - It's like watching a movie back in 1999. It's a total waste of one and a half hours. Matthew Settle's results were rather poor. I saw him in the Band of Brothers player Lt.Speirs, he wasn't that bad. In fact, not bad at all. But in this movie his plays were not convincing enough, it was pretty bad, and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew. Plus, his eyes seem empty, as if he didn't feel it. It really surprised me because he was good at the Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Yet, not even bothering to watch this movie. It's a big big waste of time. Even if you were to kill an hour or two, you have to do something else to watch this movie. Believe me, you will regret it!
