When the movie started the first 4 minutes as a trip in California, I wondered if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a mild sigh to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, the robot role or the incest aspects. There is a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. My character: D +
