Hollywood always had trouble expressing a "religious image". Strange Cargo turns out to be no exception. While using the talents for a fantastic cast, and produced on a top budget with appropriate mood photography by Robert Planck, the film fails to score credibility. Perhaps the reason why the film seems so realistic is that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements disturbs the viewer's involvement in the action and the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit still through all the ornate metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and it was impossible to accept the bath of light Ian Hunter's slick know-it-all as a Christ figure. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Get Boston / Detroit / Providence moviegoers, if any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford were somehow involved in a "message image". It flopped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the movie has enjoyed some of the revival on television. A home atmosphere seems to make the film's allegory more receptive to viewers. In spite of its growing reputation as a strange or unusual movie, the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable, heavily moralistic lines that no one has guessed how the protagonists will eventually come to terms with fate.
