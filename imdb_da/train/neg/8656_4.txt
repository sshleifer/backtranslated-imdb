This is the first non-zombie underreport ive done, but this movie is worth making a review for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately it's still an obvious b-movie. Dinocroc itself looked good, but I thought the movie itself needed a little more weight as in action and violence, because every time the hook is shown or is in a battle scene, it does not go as much as the hook is shown and the hook either kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus and the play was better than average, and the most surprising is that the hook looked fleshy instead of a comic book * curse of komodo * coughs. I enjoyed this movie enough to be happy that there will be a sequel that is more than what I can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a look.
