This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, though the shots, "special effects", actor and I mentioned the plot? Every single thing in the sucked ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "over-doing" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do; This should be one of those movies, you can't really tell what the hell is going on until the end. You are fascinated, without knowing who is dead and who is alive, and who killed who and why, and just when you think you have the timeline right, you find yourself wrong and the movie ends - leaves you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the author of this junk, yes, Olga ?? The author, director, producer, screenwriter, caster, production designer, art director, costume designer and also a double for one of the characters are some scenes ... this is basically a women's movie and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions" "You can't go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Now it may come as a shocker, but" this time "Olga over did this big time, jumped from stage to stage from dreams to reality ... but Wait! after all this was a dream after all ... or was it ?? The picture falls and I realized that none of this ever happened, the girl was all alone on the ship ... actually there was no ship ... no wait! There is the ship again and the guys! They're alive! Thank God! No, they call her to join the cruise ship ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they're dead after all ??? or maybe they were never alive at first ??? <br /> <br /> If you understood what I just said, you might like this movie - otherwise it's a boring job and the only reason I put through this crap is to find out how in hell can they finish this movie ... Don't look here if you appreciate time, ever 90 minutes wasted in this case ...
