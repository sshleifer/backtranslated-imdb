Though I was a filmmaker and had a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was for a treat when I went home "My Wrong ..." (not that the DVD deck gives away but chooses in instead of the ambiguous quote from controversial director Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes"). I should have a better knowledge of this and avoided this incomplete (and often offensive) piece of twoddle. <br /> <br /> The scene of the church is disgusting to look at (especially since we are all familiar with Morris's oblique attitude to pedophilia from his infamous television series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this movie is labeled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's comment sounds like a new idea in principle (although I have been a runner, it is often an interesting and unobstructed perspective on the film-making process), but unfortunately this is not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public school children who ranting about dogs on film before they conclude that there are no really good films with the lead role. This is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Saying this movie goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies too much on its increased style at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, from which the viewer is strangely disturbed and unfulfilled. The simplified message - that man must take responsibility for his actions - is both clear and ill-illustrated. <br /> <br /> The movie has its moments of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism, but eventually it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just end up being annoying. If you want to see a really good piece of short film, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life", by Peter Capaldi.
