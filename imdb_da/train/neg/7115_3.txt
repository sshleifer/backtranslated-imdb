Okay, so the introduction, with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of scare during the movie, is so boring, it's fun. And then the first "skull scene" is then pulled out and un-suspenseful it's fun. The actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent that is at least a bit of real food for the thought of the characters' behavior, and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go. The action is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie doesn't fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie would. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even the lowest. If I just read the manuscript, I would say there was potential for this to be a decent movie. It's just the horrible direction and production that destroys the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there's a lot worse out there.
