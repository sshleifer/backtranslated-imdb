Although it shatters the odd good joke, humor is generally quite dry, with members of the panel often pulling faces or resorting to rough language and waiting for the crowd to pat the lama enough jokes. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what another comment says I don't think it's the best RTE ever made, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest kind of whites, there are few really fun intelligent gags that would make you really laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by the comedians' well-known names rather than judging the quality of the gags that are not so good. Overall, it is mediocre with some good laughs to have, but it can often be mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Gulod or Dave Allen's stuff. I find Benny Hill more fun.
