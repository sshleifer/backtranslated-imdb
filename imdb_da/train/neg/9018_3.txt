This is a formal B science fiction movie, and the director made no bones about it. It's about a dragon that is restored to the life of a scientific team. All done are things you have seen many times before. It's a weak script with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypical signs and situations. The director attacks this by simply making it a formula film, without attempting to trick us, and it gives this movie a mild appeal, but that is not something you will probably remember for a while. It is best seen while you are cooking, cleaning, training. Kind of thoughtless fun. It has its place in entertainment, but it's certainly not something you sit down with friends to see, unless you're just full and don't care. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I don't think it's as crazy as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the records thought it was spectacular. It really avoids me as I do not see any attempt to make it a memorable movie.
