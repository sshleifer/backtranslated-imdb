"Arahan" adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre. To compare this confused movie with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chow's movie is a mistake. First, the battle scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here has been done before and better by likes like Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting in intelligent Motion Pictures needs logic. It does not look like something that serves blows that have no harmful effect as in the "Matrix" sequels. <br /> <br /> The attractive female leader So-Yi Yoon imprisoned the screen, but she never convincingly convinced the physical demands of the role Ziyi Zhang had made it so easy in "House Of Flying Daggers". Having a martial arts background serves well in the Kung Fu movie. Throwing actors who are inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (See Aya Ueto in "Asumi") unless you are a very talented director who, like "Arahan," does not prove Seung-wan Ryoo.
