My child does better videos than this! I feel ripped off by $ 4.00 spent renting this thing! There is no date on the video box, apparently designed by Wellspring; And what's even worse, there is no production date for the original movie that is listed anywhere in the movie! The only given date is 2002, leading an unsuspecting tenant to believe he is getting a new movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad from a point of view to be outdated and irrelevant at all times, but precisely when it was made, I am amazed that someone would take the time and cost to market it as a video. It may be interesting for students to study counterculture in the 1960s, anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; But when you read the back of the video tape, there is no suggestion that this is what you get. If you make the mistake of renting it, it's probably best seen on drugs, so your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the leaders Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind as you see it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene; So knowing I'm sure you'll be asleep well before the end.
