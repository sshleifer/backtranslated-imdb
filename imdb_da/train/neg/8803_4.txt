I loved "Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped it would be just as fun, but unfortunately it was not. Some bits are good though. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, knew his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was fun. Everyone ignores him and he just gets taller and taller and finally kisses Burgundy, which is also not recognized. But on the whole the story is not gel. However, it is a noble attempt to save the unused bits of the first movie, including a whole plot of some rather benign, would be domestic terrorists called the "Alarm Clock". Maya Rudolph from Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a few fun lines, but basically this unused plot line is good reason to be unused in the first movie. The extras on this disc are pretty good, with the best two being filmed repetitions with lots of improv comedy, and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an "exec producer" that Ferrell discovers early was not even part of the movie in any way , shape or form. It turns out that he is "just a guy" who went to the side of the recording studio and was like a producer. However, it is some beautiful fun things and continues for approx. 10 or 15 minutes
