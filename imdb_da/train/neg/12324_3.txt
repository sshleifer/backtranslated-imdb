This was a rip-off of the same garbage, we had to see Bob Saget been half an hour before this. Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America's Best Home Videos except with a host who has a combined IQ of three. The Tawny Kita really needs the money, and Coulier had to go to the trash for his jokes. It was torture enough to see him imitating Popeye and other washed comics starting at Full House. The one guy who played all the practical jokes at all deserves to be on the receiver of a class A wedge. Couliers need money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
