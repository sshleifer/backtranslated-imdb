I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I didn't feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because Gore alone was shocking. <br /> <br /> I went several times in my living room in desperation for something to happen to this movie. Haven't we seen all this before? I didn't like any of the characters Barr the guy in the sewerage. I felt bad for him. But then I couldn't imagine why he was still alive and was not murdered by Creep? So many questions need to be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not a good one. judge for yourself.
