This movie is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've seen. It has a very small plot, mostly parties, beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they made this movie. You can say that Elvis was also wasted, he is much, much better in "Follow that dream."
