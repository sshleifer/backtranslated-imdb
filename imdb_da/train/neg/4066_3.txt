In director Eric Stanzes 'ISOYC, IPOYG', three men are subjected to torture in the hands of a woman whom they have all sexually abused. The first victim has to eat his own villain before being killed to death. The next crack ends with a ball in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy's body. But it is the third man who gets the worst: he must see the highly tattooed 'star' Emily Haack getting naked and masturbating with a diet fitting (oh, he also gets the handle pushed up in his ass too!). <Br /> <br /> And unfortunately we do too (look to see her masturbate, it's not that you get a diet at hand!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is a tough viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, of course, is under the mistaken belief that she has a goddess (as opposed to of a roadie for Metallica), is constantly devoid of the camera. It's not a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to the non-stop nudity of a shrouded hack, viewers also see terrible direction from Stanze (who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees are entertaining things), some really bad actors and one fat fires penis. Really, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. It's a point for the red ax attack (as I'm a gore dog I've actually had); a point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pressed into chocolate mousse masquerading as hilarious; and a point of pure nerve to suggest that this movie could somehow be a successor to Meir Zarchi's superior exploit classic, I spit on your grave.
