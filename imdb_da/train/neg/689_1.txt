What is this? This must undoubtedly be the biggest waste of movies, settings and cameras ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high, but it's too stupid to be true. I baught this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel the urge to claim my money back. Can you imagine how hard it stinks? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what is his motivation ??? Yes, in fact, you could not help but care. And why would you? The makers of this piece of garbage certainly don't care. They didn't try to create a little bit of excitement. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's much easier to find money with a name like that) also made Kindred (1986), which was pretty entertaining and recently he made Soul Survivors. Complete crap too, but at least one had Eliza Dushku. This junk is the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yes, that's right, Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. after opening credits. She is the other person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to mention or miss him afterwards, so who cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not deserve the term actors actually, is totally uninteresting. You hope they die a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
