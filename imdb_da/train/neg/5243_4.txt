Make your own mind. Personally, I found it so much fun to receive a Spiral Crane from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drinkers, to avert prison times, are ordered to mentor two children from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth degree and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man who rolls plays in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their accusations an invaluable insight into life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is having fun with her peaty analogies. Support is: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
