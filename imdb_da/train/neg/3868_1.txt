If you study Welles and want to see how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse to make the protagonist a self-absorbed dummy to explain how he can fall into a half-baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom teatrics and ridiculous plot phrases that eventually follow. Not taken by the high rating of this movie in DB as I was; All I can guess is that there are a lot of dead hard old Welles and Hayworth fans out there.
