This is almost the worst movie you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the blanket underneath this, for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis'. It appears that the space scenes were made in a power plant from the 1950s, just before demolition. The music really sucks. The action is wood and ham. The characters they depict are superficial and convincing. The reason is predictable. It is immediately and wisely obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other movies. The quality of the direction begs faith. <br /> <br /> But you should see if you only have to experience what should be one of the biggest waste of a small budget ever. This is an invaluable example of a silly movie!
