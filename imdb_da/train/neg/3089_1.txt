This movie is so bad, it's comical. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, the television show where three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this much movie to mock. I suggest seeing it (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see Hobgoblins if you are not ready to stop within the first scene. In fact, you can't see this movie period. Please. At least not serious. Its jokes aren't funny (at least) and you want a lot more fun parody or a parody of it and watch the movie. You can feel yourself sick by seeing so save yourself. Read a book. Washing clothes. Everything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
