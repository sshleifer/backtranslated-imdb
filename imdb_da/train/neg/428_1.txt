Wow, a film about NYC politics apparently written by someone who has never set foot in NYC. You know there is a problem when you expect the credits to roll in a moment and the movie continues for another half an hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the plotline ranges between boring and ridiculous. A horrible movie.
