my wife is a fanatic about this show. That was the case I bought her seasons one to three and year four is on order. Personally, I think the show is a big farce, the cast is just as bad. Alyssa Milano should have attached to the other trash films she made as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire to name a few, the other female supporting cast members are as inappropriate in their depictions. I have seen better special effects in the old republic's pictures series, I saw as a child. I can understand why the male leaders stayed on the show for such short periods, even though I didn't know if it was their own choice or not. Please. Please do not renew for another season that is probably enough, Bob
