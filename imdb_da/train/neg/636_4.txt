A few farmers struggle in life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the leading roles, speak with false accents, and emphasize ancient stereotypes and patriarchal ideologies. A good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. They are seen as properties and investments. Because it is a large budget film where many extras collaborate, large sets are built up and special effects take place, filmmakers cannot risk employing less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Oscar for this performance, which is the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan must be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems that Franklin didn't know when to finish the picture. This movie can be dangerous if it is taken as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
