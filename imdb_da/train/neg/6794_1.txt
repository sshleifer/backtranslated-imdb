Friday the 13th step over! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there. I won this movie in a college competition and it was a waste of money even though it was free. Jack Jones stars as a really awful singer trying to find some killers or something. At least Friday, thirteen never tired me. I'd rather have my nails pulled than see this again.
