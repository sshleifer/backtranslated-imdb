As some of the other reviewers have mentioned earlier, I would like to know what moron actually reads the manuscript and went "," Yes !!! This is it. This is the next movie we come to green light !! "And who this person is, must have his or her head examined for actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for actually saying money to have it done after reading the script, I would like to give you my email address and maybe you just want to give away some more money.This movie is horrible in every way. Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They have made some great movies and had some incredibly fun performances along the way. only the premise threatened by all the logic, not only is the act terrible, it is not only the whole movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to watch this movie Maybe if it was free ... naaah, it would still be a waste of time. Normally, I would tend to write some lengthy detailed review of why this movie is so bad, but just enough to say let my brief do talk This is the lowest common denominator of film making, and it's about as unfunny as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 .. makes my top ten worst movie list all the time!
