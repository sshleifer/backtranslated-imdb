Effect (s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world, but in the Hollywood remake world, it is not only possible, it is required. Haunting has been given computer treatment with a first-class filmography turner director, who once showed promise (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a large budget waste (Twister, Speed ​​2). <Br /> <br /> The actor is superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones seem to want them to be everywhere, but in this movie. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the case, but whatever may be unknown is unknown as the script feels like half of it is missing. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts emerge without rhyme or reason, and the story only ends with a most unsatisfactory non-event intended to unpack in the last 90 minutes of inanity. There really isn't. There is not even a reason to see this for the effects, as we all know that everything can be put on the screen now. Why not see the effects in the service of a good story rather than just for their own sake?
