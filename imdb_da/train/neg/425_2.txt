I can't believe I'm so angry after seeing this that I'm writing my first ever review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed Planet Earth little. Now I knew to go into this that it was announced as "from the people who brought you Planet Earth," but I had no idea that they would use blatantly the same cuts as the groundbreaking miniature documentary series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Shame on Disney not to warn people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save a James Earl Jones voice and 90 seconds sailfish that I didn't think was in Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime for everyone is that while Planet Earth is using Islamic tragic history as evidence of killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took that story and transformed it into family-friendly tripe. After the death of the male polar bear, they show their pups grown significantly a year later and spit some waste on how they are ready to carry their memory and that the earth is really a beautiful place. No mention of the impending deaths of the adult cubs due to the same situation their father endured, no warning of problems for future generations, if we do not get our action together, nothing. Just a montage of things we've already seen throughout the movie (and many times more if you're one of the billions of people who have already seen Planet Earth). I have never left the theater so it felt ashamed and cheated in my life.
