The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster was a couple of interesting stylish hands. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Cartoon death is a bit derived from a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which delivers death with cartoon. Still, it was handled nicely, especially with the ink bleeding, and the color was removed. <br /> <br /> There is another good scene with a demon motorcycle. <br /> <br /> That said, I was glad I got the DVD cheap in a store that went out of business because it was pretty awful. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time, and both films were just as annoying with the constant realizations that you've seen a dream. But where "Soul Survivors" have nothing to redeem, or if it makes any sense, this has at least a few stylish notes, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD can go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens, which is the only way to look at this. The writings between the creative gore moments are quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
