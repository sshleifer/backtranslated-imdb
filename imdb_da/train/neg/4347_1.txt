Wow ... what can I say ... First of all IMDb says this is in the late 60s ... which means Carlito would be very close to going to jail, he came out at 75 and said he was 5 years old. They used a bunch of no actors, and a story that didn't even make sense. They only bring back an actor, Guzman, and hes playing a completely different guy. Why did it end up with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Where's Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Where is Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You would think he would have been in this one. And if that makes sense, where is Rocco and the black guy in the first? It was just stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
