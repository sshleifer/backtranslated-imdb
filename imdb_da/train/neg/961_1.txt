Stupid, simplistic and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NUHVER) goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> This short (just over sixty minutes) is not as much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip-off of Sam Raimi's QUICK & DEAD (his admitted greeting to the spaghetti westerns) brought into a modern setting. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was just a urchin, placed her father's father's fate (a brief como of Gary Sinise) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (the play of the shaken Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the bad Mr. Tojo (the game with minimalist appeal of Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was only a urchin, placed her father's fate in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear ole father was pulled and quarted by a semi-trailer. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadistic lamps Saki with ?? Well, I won't spoil it for you if you decide to see it. In short, Saki ?? a pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' ?? rides into town ?? basically there is an auto shop and a taverna along with an american military base so i guess it enough for a city ?? destroyed by Tojo, the local crime word with a ridiculously high price on the grounds of reasons never explained or explored. Saki invokes his true self as a bounty hunter, taking Saki the local defenders in shootouts whose choreography carries more than a transitory resemblance to the works Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the film, Saki has shown his fair amount of torture to the wicked, but she rises to the occasion ?? on the knees, in a ridiculous attempt at a surprise ends ?? and overcomes all her enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Don't ask where she gets the rocket starter. Just see it yourself. Don't try to laugh. <br /> <br /> The picture quality is the average for the DVD release. There is a grainy quality for several sequences, but overall it is not a bad transfer. The sound quality leaves a little to the imagination at times, but again it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> It's rather a bad movie.
