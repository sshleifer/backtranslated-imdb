For the first 20 minutes or so (I saw it on a PS2, so I really have no idea how long it took) Alienator sets an interesting premise. I don't think I've seen a slasher movie with a stranger from another planet like baddie before. However, the interest soon becomes stunned unbeliever as you realize that 'alien' is a great bodybuilder woman in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Don't think I'm holding it against it. In the world of shlock horror, patented ridiculous can often be a good sign. But the incredible stupidity of its premise is that the whole movie really goes after it. Alienator is fun as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. Actors jump on unsuccessful attempts seriously, potential genius lines of pure cheese dialogue stumble upon with unpleasant incompetence and the direction fails to summarize even one or two decent set pieces. Once the movie is finished, you can hardly see the original concept through the stack of total tripe teams stacked on it. <br /> <br /> Add to this, "Alien" just kills people by evaporating them, as opposed to doing something "slashing" as such, and you have a huge beating pile of good ideas to be abandoned to to rot. You will laugh at Alienator, but AT it, not with it. If that's your thing, go ahead and check it out.
