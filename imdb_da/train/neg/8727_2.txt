Let me start by saying that I can enjoy almost any bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970s. Seriously. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> There are far too many items that Martino is trying to inject, and none of them work (except the hook-away-wild stuff) very well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners who, of course, have set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. I can't even remember where it's going ... how sad it is ... Basically people are resorting to seeing this native tribe and its ceremonies, but ultimately disturbing the "Alligator God" of the river, then continuing going on a rampage, killing holidaymakers and some tribal people too. It sounds good, yes? Well, don't get your hopes up. There is minimal violence to the end, the special effects are so bad, it was like a nursery class performed them, and the love story thrown in is ridiculous. There are seriously a few scenes where it seems they are putting up a camera underwater in a pool and throwing a toy galaxy, like a dart, into the water and it should be that the streets attacked. I'm not making fun. In another wonderfully designed special effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible descending plastic street, which is suddenly five times the size of a van. (A few minutes ago he was only big enough to eat a human, but now he dwells on a full-load truck ...) It's really pathetic. The only other flick I can think of where the effects were so bad I was pulled out of the story was Bruno Matthew's masterpiece, "Rats", what about the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and anyone who couldn't be scared. /> <br /> Normally I would say something Sergio Martino was a solid must-see, but this is a must-pass. Waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + sticker price from No Shame. This is a shame. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
