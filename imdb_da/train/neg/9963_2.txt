I love Alec Guinness. And that says a lot about this movie. In fact, he's not bad at it. He just seems to stand aside, be urban and his usual lovely self, but invest nada. It's obvious that the girl he's matched with is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen her when he was young and of course not so happy now. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the illegal "Suzanne" brother, another twit. "Donald" strives to be a French Heathcliffe, and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What deep dark secret did he hide behind his forehead? Was he in love with his father's mistress? Why did he move Suzanne's hair when she plotted to bring the different parts of this turkey together in the country? Or maybe he had just had enough of her unpleasant plays. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been charming with Guiness and the "older woman" who reminisces and sees Paris together. It would have been a great story! Two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why didn't anyone get there? I suggest seeing Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but worthy movie.
