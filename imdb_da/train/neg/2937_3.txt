An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who do not appreciate opera exploits the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, fails badly. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can find a recording of Pavarotti that does what he does best. The reason is about a romance with a doctor who heals the throat, which has suddenly become troublesome. <br /> <br /> Only because it came out so long ago, it's pretty much forgotten. Pavarotti, like most opera stars, is a decent actor and has the scene present except for his singing talent, and nothing he does in this movie negates this opinion. His fault is not due to rejecting the scary script. Perhaps because great operas can have stupid stories, he tolerated this. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? Should we know <br /> <br /> The reason is weak and tired. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick up a few juicy lumps (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. Just get one of his many great opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he fits best. <br /> <br /> It would be one of IMDb's 100 worst movies, if more people remembered it and gave it a little voice; It would fit perfectly into a list of several singers, actors, models and athletes' efforts to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it all goes wrong because of incompetent action or a terrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he hadn't shown such a good voice. But effective as an actor (opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved this turkey from a script. I give it a polite 3 out of 10 because somebody might have become a fan of Pavarotti song and opera because of this movie.
