Waiting to go into theathre with tickets in my hand, I expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie that could finally add my appetite to movies about robotics, but instead I was disappointed with every aspect of it and once again showed it amazing special effects cannot help a dull plot, which in my opinion was worse this year. In this movie I was unhappy, Will Smith showed nothing new in this movie, but I never saw his acting change since "But In Black", which was his only success in my opinion. He had to retire later than not destroy his name with titles such as "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4.10
