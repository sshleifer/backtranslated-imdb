Let me be clear about this movie. I didn't look at this movie because of the plot, I see it on the crazy sex scenes. That said, this movie is so god horrible, I waving between sheer joy to see a godly body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyes off the disaster on a plot. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The First scene in the movie had already cattle me. You see a woman painting something by the lake, in pure bliss and calm, so a beautiful girl approaches and asks if she can paint beside her. When they are both finished, they show each other what they had done ... and the woman painted A VINEYARD when she is in the entrance to the lake. What kind of screwdriver director would make this kind of mistake? And in another scene, Traci gets to kill his teacher's boyfriend by smashing him with the sling bar, and then she swims away, and none of the city's police once lost her. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY WAS NOT A GLOVE THAN IF? Her fingerprints are all over GOD DAMN BOAT !! Then the worst is when Mandy is around, playing the "chilling" sound effect that sounds like a cat in hissy fit. It's also a true shame Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I feel really sorry that she should star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also starred in this movie. All in all, 2/10.
