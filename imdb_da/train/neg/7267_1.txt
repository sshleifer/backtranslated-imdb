This movie is simply too long, too repetitive, with the male nudity and sexuality being (as said a homosexual with my own collection of adult titles) too free and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut to ten minutes and just as effective without trying the patience (and endurance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on an early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival audience; the type of audience who tend to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as without much dialogue, shorts, foreign films. The almost sold-out audience in an approximately 275-seat theater began to dribble in the first half of the movie, and while the vast majority held for "pay off" (which never actually arrived), I never have 14 years to attend In any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, seen such a large number of people walk away from a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was. It could also have gone in different directions, still with less time, and it was much more effective. <br /> <br /> As it currently exists, it's not something you can easily recommend or someone I would like to see again.
