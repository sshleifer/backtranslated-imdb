Captured this movie on the tube on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad I looked at IMDb to see what others believed in it. I was not surprised at the number of stupid people who enjoyed this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked at the comments to read the hated categories to find out that they were none. I was shocked at this; I always look at it hated, it's like they are always those who hate a movie, no matter how good it is. Somehow, this movie has made it unharmed by the hates, I say no to it and proudly proclaim that I hate this movie! I know I should go into detail about why I hate this movie, but it would only give this movie more respect than it deserves.
