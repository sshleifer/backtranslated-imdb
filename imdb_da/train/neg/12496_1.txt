To be brutally honest ... I LOVED to see Severed. That's why I <br /> <br /> gave it a 1/10 stars because of its highly imaginative <br /> <br /> story / movie / performance / everything. This movie was a RIOT to watch. If <br /> <br /> you enjoy watching bad movies to poke fun on them, you will <br /> <br /> really get a kick out of Severed. <br /> <br /> The story It really doesn't matter, it involves a guy who is bald <br /> <br /> and has a sword and goes around protecting casual people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural twist ... no one ever sees him do it. <br /> <br /> Even when he enters a night club in a very memorable scene and knocks off a girl's noodle and no one sees it. <br /> <br /> Not only did Severed look like it was filmed on video - it was <br /> <br /> filmed on someone's home camera. The filmmakers had <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> actually holding together in some scenes. But for the most part you can't hear the actors ... you can't understand what they're doing and you laugh <br /> <br /> when the next vicit gets his pumpkin interrupted from his body. <br /> <br /> Go rent this movie. Support movies like this - they are a hoot and <br /> <br /> a hollow!
