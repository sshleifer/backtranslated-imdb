Anyone who has seen a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that is brushed by the scheduling table. So when Lara moves into Patti's home and starts methodically driving her landlady bonkers, I didn't even blink. When Lara eventually pours her activities to threaten the bad Patti and kills her to do something about it, I just nodded. You see on Planet LMN that people don't behave like they do for a particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. Only at Planet LMN could anyone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house using their seductive powers !! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much, and Lara went out of her medication and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly things ending up being injected into a person's stomach and a body bag goes out the front door. Fears! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You have to see it once, just for the big laugh you get. On the Improbability Scale, I give this movie a 95/100. Make a large party of popcorn and get some apple slices too. You understand later.
