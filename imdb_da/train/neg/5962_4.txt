Paul Naschy made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from relatively good to rigid waste; and, unfortunately, horror rises from the grave are closer to the latter. The reason is just your average story of a witch, a troll or (as is the case here) warlock, who gets killed - but not before swearing revenge on those who did it ... etc. We then get a s√©ance and a things lead to another, and soon the executed warlock is not so good again. The reason is slow, painfully boring, and the film feels constantly meaningless. The characters stretch out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way at all. Paul Naschy wrote the manuscript, and if you ask me, he must keep on acting because the dialogue is thin to the extreme and serves only to make the movie even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also instructed Naschy in the Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Devil's Curse, gives dull direction here, which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the movie. Sometimes, crap films like this have some charm about them; But horror upsets from the grave don't even have it. This is a painfully boring movie that has little or nothing in the way of interest.
