Can anyone please stop John Carpenter from continually and deliberately destroying his reputation? How low can you go? It seems that this man has lost self-respect. <br /> <br /> This episode looks like it's been done by a movie student, it's not even worth starting to talk about what was bad because it was just a drill, directed by someone without talent like the movie creator or Without any motivation ... Come on, Mr Carpenter, please wait immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop wasting waste like this in a bad tradition from the escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk instead.
