Because it is, that's why! This is the same jealous-daughter-killer-people flick we've seen a billion times. Rosanna Arquette does something worth watching, and Mandy Schaffer's short key scene (after teasing with lightly dressed clothing throughout the film) at the end makes this trite blarney worthwhile, but not quite. <br /> <br /> * Out of * ***
