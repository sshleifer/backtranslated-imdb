By reading the box in the video store, this movie seems to be fun disruptive. You know the type .... fun but should scare you .... it wasn't fun or terrible. The script was boring ... the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness .... they were so anticipated. the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script ... at least I hope it wasn't their best. watch this movie at your own risk ...... i give it negative 3 stars out 10
