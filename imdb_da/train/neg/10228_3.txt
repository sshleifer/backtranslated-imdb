To be honest I had heard it was pretty bad before I decided to see it, but I'm never one to let others influence my views, I'm actually more inclined to see something out of trouble! Bullwhip had one thing to go for me before it was seen, at least, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and the beautiful eyes were in it had me immediately interested. The picture is not very good and is actually very morally questionable, all characters are corrupt and sharp in a form or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories. It's all good and good if the surrounding movie can do justice to a bunch of abominable people and create a tight climax shaking image. Unfortunately, it doesn't, and when the final fills your eyes with sugar, you can't help shouting out that you've been cheated on seeing a pretty bad movie, no one in the cast comes out with any credit, with Captain Guy Madison painfully wood in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend it to anyone, 3/10
