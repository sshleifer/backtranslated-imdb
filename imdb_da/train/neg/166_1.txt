Okay, first of all, I didn't sit down to see the premiere of a "Star Trek" series to watch a cowboy fly around the room. How a normal Enterprise episode works. 1 Archer finds a nebula or anything from it and wants to look at it, but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 he sends ship in the bill and the shooter gets damaged ... in all the episodes I've seen are all the problems because of Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh, and did you see an example of an episode showing Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode, but after that, I gave up on the Enterprise and turned me straight to TV. Come on!!!! This is the star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was the banana slug ?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug, but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason. Okay, fine, a little stupid to bring you pet mud in the room, but whatever. Okay that was what I thought until they left it on a desert plan !!!!! A path slug cannot leave in a desert !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these writers? <br /> <br /> Some ways, just to say, whether Enterprise is on, DO NOT SEE IT !!!!!
