I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay some time ago. I looked at parts and found it just too stupid to review again. The large amount of aqueous 'blood' in the beginning is simply outdated - not to mention the sounds of the winds. My friends and I made a super low budget movie, and the effects still exceeded this crap party. <br /> <br /> As for the number of errors in this movie, there are far too many to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my theater teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final judgment: Do not disturb this "horror" flick. <br /> <br /> 3 Stars (out of a possible 73)
