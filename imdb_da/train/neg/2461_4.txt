There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of, let's say, small monsters or scary looking dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work. Well, give a crazy dentist an exercise and a mouth, and you can guess what happens next ... As I said, brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should. Especially the end is a big disappointment. Last note: look for Mark Ruffalo (you can count on me, eternal sunshine ...) in this one. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
