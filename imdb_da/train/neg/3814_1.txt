I can see little girls enjoying this show, but it's ridiculous to call this a family show. I am amazed at how well remembered it is after all these years. It's a very unfunny and stupid show about the widow's father living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others like the seasons continue. All the plot lines generally have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with another and every episode they make and ends with a light creepy joke. As for the actors, I also didn't like them. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the father of mother responsibility. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 year old that makes cartoon voices and works like a kid and he is horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, but he was so clichéd that it was hard to see him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a really bad actress and showed no emotions ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichéd like the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed which bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they turn them off. The lines of too many history lines were so unrealistic stupid that it is poorly worthy. This is a "family" show that has tried to replace any good stuff with beauty and love, and even though they are needed for a family show, they overstated too much. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 min.
