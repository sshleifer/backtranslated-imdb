Another made for tv piece junk! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word movie in the most possible form!) I thought Telly Savala's career had hit the rock bottom when he made the voice of visiting Birmingham video shown on Tarrant on TV on a semi regularly, but then I forgot that he was involved in this! I had tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but cable TV brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me !! <br /> <br /> I like the bit (laughing sarcastic!) in the movie claiming to be a scene from Liverpool in the eighties, but it's blatantly a shot of Zagreb Cathedral at the end of the eighties. Also, the steam train on which the commanders train, shows the JZ (Yugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslavian State Railways) logo on the side of the locomotive clearly, although the decision makers have tried to fail them. Why not just film in the UK if this is where most of the movie is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap waste and waste of celluloid!
