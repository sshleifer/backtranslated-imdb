This movie was amazing. It is beyond terrible. I often come with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find horrible movies to look for their comical value. My friend suggested this, but when we saw it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it just because I could say I had, but I couldn't. It's so bad. Terrible runs gags, lame acting. The main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather see Costener's Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again. I think they are trying to deal with some problems with dinosaur discrimination, but the part of the movie that really stands out is that the dinosaurs are constantly knocking things over with the tail and then guffawing about it. It hurts. Look, if you're a hopeful masochist, otherwise, let this one be alone.
