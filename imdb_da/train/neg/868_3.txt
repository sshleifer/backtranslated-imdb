Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed them to the monkeys. Monkeys are fun. People with amnesia who don't say much, just sit in the open eyes, aren't that funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is not a black person in it, nor is there a fun thing in it. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these things in a way and puts them on their dollar stand. It's labeled Unrated. I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken other things out, who knows? All we know is that what they took out is no more. <br /> <br /> The play seemed OK to me. There are many unimaginable things. It was supposed to be a city? It should be a big lake? If it is so hot in the church, do people transform themselves, why do they wear all coats?
