I rented this movie in a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH' The play is so badly done I have seen kids in high school doing a better job The whole play seems to be just reading their lines, no feeling, no emotions, and no room to catch the viewer. On another note, the special effects were insanely cheesy, and it all looked as if it had been shot with a camera that can be bought a radio cabin. <br /> <br /> The clown looks nothing like the video tape. Heck he doesn't even come up in the movie for almost at the end and all he does is hum songs and walk around stalking a few characters. There is no real murder shown either, so this is not a real slasher movie either, since I have seen it, I have asked a few things 1. If 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' would not be a serial killer killing clowns ? 2. If your friend goes away, why do you want to go out into the woods to have sex instead of looking for her? Really sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it that the only real action sputtered in vain at the end suddenly? Do you finally decide to show your efforts in their job? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it so you don't waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
