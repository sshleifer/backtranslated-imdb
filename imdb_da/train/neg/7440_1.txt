I'm going to post the other person who, after years of using the IMDb to watch movies, has been motivated by Nacho's film The Abandoned to create an account and write a comment. This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The reason was on the verge of non-existence and none of the "puzzle pieces" added in any way whatsoever. The play was ridiculous and the writing was embarrassing. How this movie was supported and came to be is completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hilles cunning and repeated use of the f-word. (and brilliant sound design) If I was exposed to the opportunity to watch this movie again or be beaten by wild drills, I would be against a difficult decision. I'm disappointed that I can't give it 0 stars.
