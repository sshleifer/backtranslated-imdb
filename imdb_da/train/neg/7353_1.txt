Seeing it now is still as skanky and sexist as I remember. comes from a time when girls were "Dolly Birds" and basically men's toys. It's hard to realize that it comes from Hammer Studios and the fact that it's available on DVD when good movies aren't. Our nations are ashamed where the working class is portrayed as being shy or worse! Error is that you can't help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Try to keep your stomach content when you see Olive in a fluffy? Blue "cute" nightie or something like Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972. Warning this movie shows the illegal practice of pulling a motorcycle combo with a red double decker bus that I have been informed is not a Routemaster but and Bristol. Just don't bother looking at something decent instead of Porridge or Father's Army ... or a fly crawling on a wall.
