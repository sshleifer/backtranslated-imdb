I am a youth pastor's wife and we took some young people to watch this movie. We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They didn't get it and I didn't enjoy it. It is based on a concept that has undergone all three of the world's largest religions (Bible Code, the Torah Code, and the Code of the Quran) and is so dubious to be ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in art, it is a step forward for those who believe we control our brains at the door.
