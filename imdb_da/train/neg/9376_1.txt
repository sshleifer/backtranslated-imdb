while i watched this movie i got sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure. When my wife came to Sweden, she looked at oldies and had a really good laugh. but this American version must be renamed and never be shown again. It is terrible from the beginning to its end. how can they make it so bad. well i guess someone is accusing the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi. Never watch this movie again and never broadcast it. burn the movie and save the kids. If you want to watch Pippi then look at the original movie and get a good laugh. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin, you will never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. When you read the "spoilers" explanation, "surprise" a surprise and rob the viewer of the movie's excitement and enjoyment. "well i guess the director stands for this ... you are looking at this movie at your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
