Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two players I have appreciated in their careers and that was the only reason to choose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regret it! These two great actors humble themselves all the way by performing a series of irrelevant, imaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad in itself) sketches that would make people laugh but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by staring at it - I can't think of anything else because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since then. I would recommend avoiding this movie unless you want your opinion of the two actors spoiled.
