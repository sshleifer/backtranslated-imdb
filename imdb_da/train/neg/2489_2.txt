STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey before the name became synonymous with character in The Simpsons) is a (typical) unorthodox cop who gets results but wins his superiors some mess. To avoid his partner being killed at the start of the movie, the plot takes another trip and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico, where a top-secret American super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through, only to stay taken hostage with the crew by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This inexpensive look (even at the 80's standards), boring little action movie was a bizarre career move to Gary Busey after making an impression as the flameless villain Joshua in deadly weapons. He goes straight through the movements with his cardboard character here, edgy and zany as ever (with 'butthorn' is his trademark laid down for the evil ones) but without the material to back him up. Henry Silva has a screen crook presence, but he is completely miscast here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) And the horrible script gives him some really lumpy lines of dull dialogue that makes his performance like ridiculous wood. He is just one of a number of action movie characters, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix. After a boring first half without very exciting actions, things get a little at the end, but it's too little late, and none of it manages the task of being fun. *
