A noble effort, I think, but ultimately a poor. Before I watched this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was filthy. After seeing it, I still do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and they will be disturbed in the film's unnecessary revisions (update from 1850 to 1970 moving from New York to London). Even the fantastic talents of Paul Scofield cannot save what looks like a well-meaning but rude effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic.
