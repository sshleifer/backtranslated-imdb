It makes me afraid to write such a scathing review, but by failing to do so, I am simply encouraging these people. First and foremost, because a movie is made on a small budget, it doesn't automatically do well, nor is it good. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only achievement of the movie, as it prevented large sums of money from being wasted on a one-legged race horse with shits. Have you ever seen a comedy in the theater? Ever heard people laugh and thought "what dickens are you at"? Well, these twats were not laughing. Things got so bad in the middle of the road my cat took his first bath. This is not movie, it's kids .... no monkeys make pictures that let you feel like moving to France. Must go, there is a clown on my door .............
