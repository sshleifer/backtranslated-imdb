This is the first movie from Horrorfest I've seen and after I almost think I don't have to see any of the others. I was told that it was a "thinking man's horror movie" and must say that if it made me think I was closing down to think about what the splatter / gorilla movies in the collection would be. Don't make me wrong, not even doing this movie is worth sitting through. <br /> <br /> The reason is very washed out with too much art for the sake of art. The camera effects and music are not in place and the characters are banal to say the least. More characters and scenes seem worthless at last when they begin to reveal some of Hamilton's hooks. I figured out who Lenny was about half an hour when I figured the movie. I was so visually under whelmed and confused by Lenny revealing that I totally felt ripped off. I was expecting what I got, but they could have gone so much longer, actually the whole gore falls flat. With movies out there like "Hostel" and "Saw" you need to get a little better at a movie "considered graphic or disturbing to the general public".
