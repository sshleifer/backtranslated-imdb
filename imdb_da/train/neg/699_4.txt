Probably one of the most prominent slasher movies ever, badly acted and badly written. <br /> <br /> The PLOT Five students who stay away during the holidays close a dormitory, but some have designs on them and start killing them from one of the main suspects the crazy earthquake John Hemmitt who played by Woody Roll, or it may be one of the five characters. ACTING Not so bad, not so big, except for Daphne Zungia, who dies too fast and should have been the greatest heroine, and the rest is quite boring, though Laura Lapinski, the greatest heroine, sometimes has her charm and you feel You sad her at last. <br /> <br /> The KILLS can't really see why they banned this, the kills look fake for the most part, a guy has his hand cut in half at the beginning, which looks really fake, but the others are pretty ugly As a girl gets her head over by a car, a girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive. <br /> <br /> OVERALL Not really a big slasher cou I've been much better
