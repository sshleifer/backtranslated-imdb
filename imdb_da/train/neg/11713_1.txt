Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen this year ... I couldn't see it at the end ... It's a waste of time ... I'm really sorry about Snipes that he ended up in such a film. There really isn't much to say about it. Terrible acting, incredibly bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be. Just to tell you a scene: Police are looking for Snipes, and they surround the building with helicopters and cars they shoot around inside the building, but they are still wiping so Snipes doesn't lose anything.
