This movie is seen by some as a classic - I have no idea why. It's terrible to be ridiculous. The only saving grace with this movie is the supply of cheesy lines that are so crumbly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are a few good songs and good choreography in this movie, but then what! There is no plot, it is set in a theater without a change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie because he said I wouldn't believe how bad a movie can get! He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally, with a movie, this terrible, I would recommend that people should not see it, but in this case I think people should, as it will put all other bad movies you have seen in perspective.
