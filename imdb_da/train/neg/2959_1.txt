Whatever anyone tells you, there is a pure fact to the word "possession" in movie circles - like "what did you have for green onion this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does. That is if your head is clear and you make sense to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> At many levels, I tried to rationalize where this movie would entertain .... or even interest the average consumer. The star? The story? The unique idea? A friend's movie that kids will love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On my goodness! I am sure that when it was an "idea" it sounds good. But somewhere during the development ... someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into an entertainment that anyone would want to see or pay for ... unless they were very deep under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us couldn't see. <br /> <br /> Whether this is a complete mess. Mess, mess - sin and a mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie received a paycheck, but I would have been embarrassed to take it. I hope she fired her agent / manager / publisher over this career movement. Of course not, she continued to make more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
