Considering the original movie version of 'The Haunting', my top ten films are all the time. 'I was nourishing this adaptation with trembling. I was really careful, as this movie is a poorly written and poorly performed load of old tosh, all of them involved should be ashamed. The original was scary for me as a child for some reason! You see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera work and excellent lighting to generate fear, which is why it works. The shame of the new version is that it depends on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, more sad is that the ingredients were there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This movie should only be seen as an example of studio slaughterhouse!
