This film was made in really bad taste. The script was really bad. I really feel sorry for the late Gregory Peck, who took the title of this B-movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals. The film was politically incorrect and even insensitive to the others who fought for Japanese in World War II. There was a scene where I almost vomited, it showed Macarthur in a bunker on the Corregidor Island, who spoke to the troops as an experienced politician when he came across a wound, a bent Philippine soldier. The soldier who blinds and dies manages to sit up right after seeing the general and says, "No mother, no mother, no uncle sam" and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that Americans would never leave the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier, refreshed by Macarthur's words and giving him a smart greeting. I think if there was a more discouraging scene depicting the United States as the world's great white savior, tell me because it takes the cake. It turned out that the Filipinos are damsels in distress that are not in honor, and must rely on the great Americans for redemption only. It overshadowed with great conviction the contributions of the members of the USAFFE (US Armed Forces in the Far East). These are Philippine volunteers who were integrated into the US military during World War II, who died side by side with the Americans, who fought against Japanese, co-operating with the Americans in Batan's death march and defending the Corregidor Island by launching a guerrilla offensive after Macarthur left Australia with his famous "I must return" speech. My late grandfather, a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought Japanese with honor and love for the homeland. I think this movie does not honor them and the thousands of others that Macarthur relied on for intelligence preparation for his famous return in the Leyte golf course.
