Corky Romano must be one of the most compelling and terrifying "comedies" ever made. <br /> <br /> While the sometimes entertaining Chris Kattan, who drew a very fun performance in the fun "Undercover Brother", his character in Corky is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame as the premise is a wonderful idea. For the bad they ran out of them when they came to page 3 of the script.
