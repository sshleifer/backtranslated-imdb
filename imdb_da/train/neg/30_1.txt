I did not like the idea of ​​the woman turtle at all since 1987, we knew that TMNT were four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each of the four brothers is named after the great artists name such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here has no meaning or plays any important role, and I think the old TMNT series was much better than the new one containing Venus As a woman turtle will not add any action to the story, we like the story of TMNT, we knew in 1987 to get new enemies in all parts, is a good point to have some actions, but having a woman turtle is a very weak point to get something we want to see more new of the TMNT series but like the same signs we knew in 1987 without the female turtle.
