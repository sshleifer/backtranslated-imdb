The show had major episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up on the "Man Who Was Dead". "Throughout the house" and "Dig the cat he's really gone." This episode is about a couple who have just been married to Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes, you find out that Charles only married Peggy for his money. The two go on their honeymoon, and their car goes down a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandoned mansion. Charles quickly finds a secret with Peggy's family ... In my opinion, you should see this episode, but don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
