I've seen some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow tries to get out of the waist high mud; a head of collision between two cars a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; animals living as animals. <br /> <br /> But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hat. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad Impaler, worse than people putting kittens in microwaves. <br /> <br /> It's the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. <br /> <br /> I used to believe it was a joke, a thorough joke, and that Mike Myers might be a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something. <br /> <br /> I'm shaking
