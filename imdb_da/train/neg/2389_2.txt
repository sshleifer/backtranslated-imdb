Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and freakishly big thumbs) who hitchhikes cross-country, eventually finding her true place among a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch dedicated to preserving Whooping Crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no primary goal and just shines across the map as Sissy (perhaps that was his goal, but it doesn't involve an audience). Notorious box-office flop was not as much panned as it was ignored, and you can see why: it is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, direct dry and filmography are all variables. Thurman is a nail that forms next to the highway, trying to drive, but it's pretty much kibosh on Phoenix's career. Author Buck Henry (who did not write this but might have) gives the most secure performance as the doctor working on one of these thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
