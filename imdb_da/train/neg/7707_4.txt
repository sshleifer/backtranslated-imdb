With a title like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!", Anyone going into this thing will expect either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy that makes fun of bad science fiction movies. It must be a mixture of both with a dose of parody injected. Unfortunately, it will be flat very soon. You should never take this movie seriously, I am aware of it, but you should think it is fun, right? I found only a couple of jokes, or situations were fun (ie side by side phone conversations, the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereals, Superman walking by Lois, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't. A cult classic is a film that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor and therefore does not qualify as a cult movie. <br /> <br /> There's a good actress in it all: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin, gawky reporter, but has a loving personality, loves to persuade, and is a natural comedienne. Unfortunately, she is badly used here. "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is not as fun as, "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but it does have a few fun moments so I still want to recommend seeing it once. Avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions to the film's producer and some suspected "lost" footage dubbed in a Latin African dialect (it can be found in English outside the wallpaper).
