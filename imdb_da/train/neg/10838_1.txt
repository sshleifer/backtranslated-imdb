The moment you give an 'art movie' 1/10, you have people looking for your ignorant, semi-asserted, artistically delayed blood. I will not try to justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by noting all the 'art house cinema' I have wanted or mentioned how I gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explains the point, intent, and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> Here's how I would summarize the movie: Opening Mounting of Three Independent Urban Legends, showing almost absurd levels of co-incidence. This followed by (in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain) the following: A children's game show hosted by lung cancer trying to patch things with his cola-dependent daughter, whom he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being mocked by a mocking police officer with relationship problems while the game show's star competitor decides that he does not want to be a failed grandson, a fate that has come to another of the 60s show show participants that we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with hangers and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while the game display manufacturer himself dies of lung cancer, asks his male nurse help he patches with the son he left many years ago and who has subsequently become a woman self-help guru, although Mr. Producer's second wife suffers guilty of cheating a dying man; and oh, in the end it counts frogs (you read correctly). And I save you from the incredibly long and meaningless, literally wandering monologues, every sign seems to come up with the plane without any rhyme or reason than possibly ensuring that the movie crosses 3 hours and is classified as a "modern epic." br /> <br /> You probably think I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie (and not confusing you) if I had written the horrible thing a little more coherently, perhaps in some sentences instead for just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
