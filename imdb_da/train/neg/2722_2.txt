For the big thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is a terribly incoherent film from France that gives so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is about a bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant, but besides that, I have no idea who any of the people in the movie was or why they did what they're doing. With no coherent story to brag about, the movie loses us early, although I'm quite willing to admit that there might be something out there that actually gets a deep message out of this movie. <br /> <br /> This muddy, snappy drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of life, the final credits will still be hanging out.
