Basically a story of man versus nature, this movie has beautiful filmography, Ceylon's lush jungles and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film never really goes ahead. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later referred to the plantation foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spelling of the owner Peter Finch's late father, whose ghost throws a pallet over the Elephant Walk, which becomes a great conviction relationship between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to regain their traditional pathway to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right side. The animals go on a rampage and give the best moments for action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments when she struggles to remain a faithful wife despite his marital problems with Finch.
