It is often said that movies can never correspond to the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the movie "not as good" as the book, but is an insult to the book. I'd rather see Milan's Customers' novel fire than in this "something" that the director probably calls "adaptation." <br /> <br /> All the beautiful philosophies that ask "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable ease of being?" are set aside and instead the whole movie is about Daniel Day Lewis' (I can't say Tomas) sexual adventure with his stupid wife, his mistress and his other mistresses. Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said it: bad instructors do bad movies. Don't waste your time and money. Read the book instead, it's really worth it.
