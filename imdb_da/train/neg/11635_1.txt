Okay, this is gona being short and sweet review ... Something the movie should have taken a practice in a while made its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason why there was a petition with over 40,000+ signatures. ALL demanding Uwe Boll stops making films from franchises that people liked. Blood Rayne is a biggie there. <br /> <br /> Witnesses are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times before. The action is descent, but you can really just blame the script for it. Although I use a script myself, I wonder for a moment. <br /> <br /> The movie has little to do with the original games. HELLO, if you played the games you know, the protagonist has no real motivation beyond homicidal intrusion as a mass murder because he stumbled his toe or simular. There is too much history for such a stupid movie. as I said. I wouldn't even steal this movie. And for the person who says this is the 'Fasting movie from 2007' .......... have to look around, the news is better than this.
