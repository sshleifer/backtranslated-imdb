My roommate got No, No, Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she continued listening to it non-stop. After I finally brainwashed myself for submission, I found the songs irresistible, especially the famous one, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy ... But from the rough track I had no idea how the movie was about . So the other day I saw a copy of it in the video store, and I rented what was to be a far lost version of the movie. I thought it was great because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved are nowhere in the video I saw. Now I have never seen the 1930 version of the musical, but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little song and practically no dance and besides the sound was really bad and you couldn't really understand What people said a lot of time. Really the only highlights of this movie were the scandalous 1940s fashion. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that protrude like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather sleeve that she holds on her forearm, and she has wrapped herself in this net scarf. The one dance sequence is also a bit strange with Nanette, who makes this strange ballet thing with pin-up girl pictures on top of her. In fact, a more bright spot in the film was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being a fine artist, but at the moment, denounced the pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe holds it to old school, and their Nanette, when his masterpiece, the piece to make his career, is sold by Nanette for a small $ 5250. Doesn't she realize that this piece was his immortality ? Silly rabbit / girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat. When will you learn? Why doesn't he just have a pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the job away?
