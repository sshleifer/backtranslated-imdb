This movie has a lot of big adult stars, but fails to get you interested in a way that an adult movie should. Among all the stars, you couldn't get your kicks off any of the scenes. The film is shot in a dream like the Middle Ages, which is embarrassingly cheesy. The play is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talking about their child in college, and the dialogue is the worse I have seen in a movie. The reason was also worse with ten times. I want to hold onto the amateur pad. The sound comment was useless as it was a skin girl, but even then it was also bad. Unless your a diehard Jenna Jameson fan is here a little. 4.10
