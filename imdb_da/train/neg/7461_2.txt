*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From its very open credits, this amazing movie sets the record straight: it's an instant classic. It doesn't take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than the `Kindergarten Cop 'or the' Police Academy 7. ' The great grandeur of it left me speechless when I left the cinema and went straight back to the ticket counter to buy me another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires more impressions. The first look will surely leave you with the strange `huh? 'feeling, but do not feel embarrassed - it happens to the best of us. The story is so profoundly wise that one has to ask about the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will baffle you on your first view, but don't give up! Only in my sixth or seventh view did I begin to excavate some of the hidden mysteries of 'Corky Romano'. And beware of the unexpected twist at the end, otherwise you may be caught completely free when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most sought-after criminal, Corky is not a true FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits that he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as gay. Astonished hell out of me, I can tell you so much. <br /> <br /> Chris Katen's comic talents are unbeatable as he directs his character Corky Romano through a maze of unpredictable situations. Reminder of John Reynolds 'performance in `Manos, Hands of Fate', takes Kattan countless more personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing. But Kattan is not just about comedy. He is also a playwright as he controls the audience's feelings with his smallest movements. His facial expression reflects life itself in a way. For example, in the scene in which he walks in the faces of his brothers, one can see expressions of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his inflamed face. In a moment like that, it's hard to find a dry eye in the house. Writer writers David Garret and Jason Ward are the real heroes of 'Corky Romano.' With a story of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers might be employed to complete this ambitious project. Their talented storytelling and unorthodox structuring make "Pulp Fiction" look like a mediocre Saturday Night Live shit. Garret and Ward's story is so compelling and prolonged that it grabs your hair, extinguishes you completely, shakes you, and spits you straight out. At the end of the worldwide experience known as `Corky Romano ', you find yourself another person with different world views and different ideas, and with only one question in your mind: <br /> <br /> Why God? Why?!?
