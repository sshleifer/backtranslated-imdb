This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I see all the original movies playing on it. I really don't know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island sounds quite familiar. What was it, oh yes, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead. The movie starts with a couple of stereotypical college children on an island that makes a kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying a rather cruel death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked much like ketchup. Also in the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber teeth as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already fled and are going to eat the tourists, or the people are invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the sweetest thing was the 1000lb sabertand that crawled on his forelegs and killed the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the boy's neck. The finest death I've seen on television. <br /> <br /> The action is extremely cheesy, the special effects are terrible. The CG tigers could almost pass to clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. When one of the college students tries to escape, he uses for example. An ax to break down a door, the ax enters the door and approx. 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. However, cheese-like deaths were quite fun.
