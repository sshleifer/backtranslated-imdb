A lot of death happens in nature. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But should it be the focus of a nature documentary? What about this fascination with cruel death? Are we really going to see an adult elephant torn to the power of a pack of hungry lions? Or a cheetah grabs a gazelle at the neck in slow motion, no less! I thought it was a family friendly movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the cruel violence in the movie trailers? Was the filmmakers afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> So in typical comic relief mode, we see the magnificent Birds of Paradise performing mating rituals for the most annoying and stupid story that is humanly possible. It was surreal! It is as if the filmmakers thought they were only aimed at a spacious first and second degree school field! Wow! From remedy to moronic in heartbeat! <br /> <br /> If there are future nature documentary players waiting in the wings to read this movie review, why not focus on: Animals that actually copy; to give birth; egg laying bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socialization; play; emotional displays except fear and anger; unusual behavior that the mouth breaks; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what people call culture); communication qualities; parents, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or stupid beauty, and why not be much more rounded - and focus on joy and inspiration instead?
