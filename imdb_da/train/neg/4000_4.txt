I enjoyed the "American Movie" so I rented Chris Smith's first movie, which I thought was also a documentary. In the first minute I saw that it wasn't, but I gave it a try. <br /> <br /> What a blind film. Being true to life hardly serves you if you just have to investigate sadness, esp. that we already know about. I'm sorry but will it come as a relevance to ALL that 1) many jobs suck and 2) most are crappy, minimum wage jobs in the service sector ??? I knew that before I saw the movie. It did not, however, provide a study of what, when the film is struggling to feel "genuine" (handheld cameras, no music, etc.), it hardly goes as it would in the "real world". <would an employer be so cheerful to Randy when he picks up his check after Randy joined him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to be 6 months ?? Or the day after giving up his job (and screwing up the machine he was working on), would anyone be so easy on him? <br /> <br /> One big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he's stuck in these jobs, or has a crummy apartment, or looks like one. He's a dope. He does not notice or even really try these jobs. He has no personality. If I had to hire someone, he would not pass the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith does next, but guys, ban off the "this-is-important movie" thing. "American Job" doesn't work.
