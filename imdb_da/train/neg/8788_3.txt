What a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshing key story manages to unlock your interest in the beginning and then gradually lets you down further and further until you are scraping your mystified head when it reaches its exaggerated conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. It was not Michael Keaton's fault; It was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a whole new movie again and look a little wrinkled, but still ready to give a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife has recently died, he is obsessed with his wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), which apparently is approached by her through the funky electric fuzz business you see on your TV screen when there is nothing being broadcast. <The idea of ​​spirits communicating via the airwaves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), and there are many people who actually believe it to be genuine, so I will not comment on what I think about it or them. Let me just say that I am all about suspending disbelief when it comes to buying in great movies like this, but what I can't tolerate doesn't understand what the hell was going on, which is where I was left stranded then The credits finally started rolling. Very static indeed. <br /> <br /> There are occasional movies like this that have completely confused me, but if a movie fails for me, I tend to think it's the filmmaker's fault, not my own (unless I saw it while I was too tired to focus or something). Well, for white noise, I was totally awake, glow and bush-tailed - so guess who should blame?
