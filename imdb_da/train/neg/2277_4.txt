'The Vampire Bat' is of interest to be one of the early genre-set horror films of the 1930s, but in isolation, too little to be a true praise. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th century, where a number of murders are attributed to the vampyrism by the suspicious locals. There is a very similar feeling for James Whale's 'Frankenstein', and this is enhanced by the introduction of Lionel Atwills Dr. Niemann character, complete with its erroneous ideas for scientific development. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by suspicion falling on bat loving village simpleton Herman (Dwight Frye), which excuses a torch beam mob to go on rampage - as if they needed one. <br /> <br /> This is one of a trio of early horror movies, where Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") and like their other collaborations , the film of bad counseling suffers comic relief and tends to deviate from the horror of mainstream thriller elements. Taken in context, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derived. <br /> <br /> All we are left with is a bad Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements only a unit for hoodwink Dracula fans. But for the title, the film would struggle for itself to be considered a horror, and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer made 'Blondie' a few years later.
