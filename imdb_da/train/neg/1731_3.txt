Twilight Zone has achieved some mythology about it - like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show, regardless of what each episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, I once took back all the original Star Trek episodes (the good ones and the bad ones) because the overall reviews and reviews were just too positive. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I've scored many episodes 10, one gets a 3, simply because it was bad. The scripture was actually embarrassingly bad. Two people from opposite sides of a great war are seen wandering around throughout the episode. After a while, it is clear that they are the only two people left on Earth - as you learn in the really stupid and completely convincing conclusion. Usually the twist at the end makes the episode great - this killed it!
