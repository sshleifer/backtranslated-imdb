I went for this movie believing it had good reviews. First, it is ridiculous that they release a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001, the film looks like it is made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate on how low the budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the movie had bright sparks during that scene, I missed it when I slept on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a devil. She wears spooky trite clothes and scowls for random children. As for Alec Baldwin, a scene where he starts meeting Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly says, "Go home and write better!"
