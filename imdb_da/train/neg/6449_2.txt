Imagine the big chill with a throw at twenty somethings whose characters are all unlikely, and an iguana-like man-lizard is chasing them around and you have an idea of ​​folly in it. On the positive side, the film does not obscure displaying the monster. There are no peek-a-boo shots or night scenes where you have to imagine how he looks; He's just out there people. Unfortunately, design and construction are not so inspired. A little bit of mystery could have helped. Mind you, I've seen a lot worse, but if you have to get him out full screen too much of the girl, then your monster looks better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler forward! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is a twist ending involving the allegedly dead brother who makes no sense at all. This did not come as a surprise considering the scary writing of the script. As for the play; Let's just say that it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect us to see many of these children in future movie excursions.
