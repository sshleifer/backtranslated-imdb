I was also deceived by the packaging. I also fell for the gory packaging and DVD casing that claims "mourned fans as each copy was pulled from the shelves". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it wasn't really all that worth - no scary and very limited gore. The end was very cheesy and did not deliver the blow it should have. I really don't even know how it became a "Video Nasty" with how much tame it is. The story draws, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... it doesn't live up to the promise. The DVD bonus feature (the "interview") is very strange as the director seems very disjointed and not all there. The leading actress speaks as if she were in a Shakespeare production. It's a good laugh.
