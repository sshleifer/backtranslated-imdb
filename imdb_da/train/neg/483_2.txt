I didn't think the French could make a bad movie, but I was clearly very wrong. As mentioned earlier, this movie basically uses its title character as its starting point; Its portrayal of her life and person has little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. The scripture is horrible - pretentious, silent and vapid - and its rewriting of facts is exceptionally offensive even in a genre that is all too often distorted, rather than telling the story. Along with some pretty decent set of designs, Valentina Cervi's physical charm is the primary asset of this movie, and it is clear from the outset that the filmmakers were also aware of this; they do not waste time exploring various "erotic" sequences that have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a beautiful young girl in a state of erroneous sexual excitement cannot and does not sustain this film. The action is unremarkable, and the score is far too generic despite an interesting chord or two. The cinematography is ok, and there are some beautiful colors, but there are also some rather ridiculous sequences that use distorted lens effects more appropriately for a 1960s freak movie than a costume drama. In any case, the manuscript leaves the camera body all too often on Artemisia's body and too rarely on her paintings. All in all, an almost complete failure. It's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography. So French cannot fail!
