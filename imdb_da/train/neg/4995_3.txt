I found it a real job to sit through this movie. The soundtrack was not the best, and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was said. There was little to move the plot together and often the action simply stopped and there was a long period of conversations that seemed to be out of the movie. These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try to gather what the common thread was that tied them together. It is rare that I judge a movie so low and do it in this case, as the whole experience saw that I was thinking "so what" and "why did I waste my time seeing this."
