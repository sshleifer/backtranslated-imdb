This film, no correction, this thing, this eerie abomination from hell's burning coarse should have been killed before it even left the author's head. I probably couldn't come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try it anyway. Terrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, villain, vomiting inducing, intestinal, bad, frightening, uncomfortable, crooked, there just aren't enough words in English! The "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Don't ask how, not important. Killer snowman is about to kill people. How can you ask, can a snowman kill anyone? In tasteless ways that will make you remove your eyes if you only have it, so you don't have to endure the Styrofoam snowman any more. In ways that make you fill your ears with hot wax so you don't have to endure his snow puns anymore. Don't watch this movie! Destroy it on sight! For the sake of your soul, do not see it!
