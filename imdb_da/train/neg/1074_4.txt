I should never have started this movie and stopped looking for 3/4. I missed the right botched end. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. It had a great atmosphere, a top notch cast and director, good places. But a baaaaaad story line, a bad script. I was aware of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - it was better than the script. The reason was stupid - driven by signs that worked in unreal and unlikely ways. No one behaves like this outside of Hollywood scripts.
