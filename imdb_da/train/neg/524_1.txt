"The 40-year-old virgin" exists in a world I do not understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "f *** off" and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not be reprimanded. A world where it's really fun to go full-time and smash into other people's cars. A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass his underground. A world full of violent and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without funny jokes! I am totally shocked by the apparent chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very fun at first and stretched over all rational thoughts. The breast growth scene went on forever. <br /> <br /> The characters, except Carell, were completely one-note. And the romantic elements were completely constructed, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. It was just lame. <br /> <br /> And I also found the "Aquarius" sequence quite annoying and excessive. I hated hated this movie!
