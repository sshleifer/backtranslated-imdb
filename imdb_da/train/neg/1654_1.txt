Final score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> *** Possible scene-specific spoilers (but who the health cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1's. Even for the film's film, I look for things like music, filmography, fantasy, humor, even a good pace to be as objective about the result as possible. Look at it within its own genera or subgenera. But there is absolutely no redeeming here. I can't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I made it to the end was because I couldn't seem to change the channel - I just sat there horrified and looked at what was insulting stupid it would come up with next time. It was like seeing a snake digesting a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have fun and pull this child apart, we must. First of all, there is nothing technical about "whipped" that works. Visuals are all sitcom style. The cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going at night over and over again. The music and the score not only contribute to the movie - it is uncomfortable. Not to mention it has nothing to contribute to anyway. The play is like cardboard as it comes, all around, and it goes for Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who got this train wreck green light). These guys, apparently good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose, so if director Peter M. Cohen had rounded them off at a bus station minutes before recording. <br /> <br /> On the creative side there is no original leg in its body It has no imagination. It shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. The whole premise, or "twist," of this movie is based on man-bashing and the "idea" that an authorized woman can play men "just as they are played". Anyone who thinks this is somehow a twist or by no means original has apparently never lit a TV before. Turned shallow women are commonplace. Man-bashing is the norm. It doesn't steal from anything specific, it's worse: it steals from clich√©s. I can't imagine a woman making a movie depicting other women building so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. Make me want to rent "In Humanity" - or better yet, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants to be an "edgier" version of "There is something about Mary" so bad that you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The movie has no insight into women, men, dating, sex or really anything. Cohen is simply pleased to regurgitate myths, he has been indoctrinated with from other sex films. At the other end, the film does not seem like a satire either, because even though it is ripe with exaggerations that one might see as "satirical", it does not have the ground connection in fact that the satires need. It doesn't even know what it's satirizing. Then there is the dialogue, which is slightly more than the characters screaming obscenities on each other. Example: Grade 1: "F ** k du" Grade 2: "Oh yes, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, what could excuse all the other discretion: There are many movies without plots, without good acting, with moral repulsive signs and obscenity laced dialogue that has been fun and thus good. "Whipped" is not fun. Not for a second. It has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all completely false, not based on any true sharpness, especially enough to twist our laughs. The characters are all broadly drawn, so they will be related to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. Just look at "the tent scene", "cult classic" hair gel scene. One of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peet) 's vibrator. For some reason, the light shines on it as if he has found the Holy Grail. Why Cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators that I don't know. While he rubs it on himself, he puts it on the toilet and then tries to fish it out with his bare hands when, but my Mena enters him. Oh, my pages. <br /> <br /> But strangely, people actually like this movie. Of course, people may also like "Friends" and reality dating shows, so I shouldn't be surprised. All this, however, has a common thread. "Whipped" is great proof to me that there is only one big pocket of people in America who will laugh at any joke just because it's about sex. They like to like some show or movie (or think they like it) just because it's about dating or relationships. It is a lack of any quality that has no bearing on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to get whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly leave any dating / relationship to sell them cheap, empty, effortless TVs, movies and any number products. <br /> <br /> The only consilation is that when I die because I saw this movie, I have been credited to get back 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
