I would then believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy that this country recognizes is slapsticks and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course it went the other way - let's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with a little to show for it. I bet One Small Seed went nuts for this. I know SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have the comic chops to pull it off. Even Danny K had better timing. I'm actually serious. Each time they introduced a little character, I thought, "Darn, this person should have been a leader!" Self-employed does not mean that the camera's work must be terrible. Black and white did nothing for this movie - in fact, with such a flat dialogue, it even more so by bringing the boredom into sharp relief. The black and white were not sharp either. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Strangely enough, I saw Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition on it was fantastic - maybe that's why the shortcomings of this movie stick out in my mind. I think Corne (who was more fun than the leaders before he even said anything) spoke to this movie and not David - see it and you understand. I bet the guys who organize Oppikoppi were horrified. One would think that nothing happens at all. I got the feeling that it could have been filmed in someone's backyard. I know regular guys who have much more fun, raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these "comics". The guy they joined was ok. <br /> <br /> Guess SA's comedy will be in the Stone Age a little longer. Nice work guys.
