I watched this movie last night and I'm already struggling to remember a lot about it. The story is about a group of criminals fleeing from a space prison colony. They fly to the Moon in a space bag vacuum cleaner carrier; when they terrorize the rubbish bin men working on the moon base. <br /> <br /> It strikes me that garbage low budget sci-fi films often involve either desert planets or, like this movie, criminals escape from penal colonies. Why this is, I have no idea. But I can say with some certainty that such films are always devilish. This is really no exception. It begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half-proper dance music soundtrack. It then degenerates into a dull sci-fi thriller. So little of the consequence actually happens in this movie that I literally struggle to write a useful review, so if you read this, I apologize for not being able to inform you about the film's subtleties and nuances. For the record I remember a dull bunch of evil, a boring bunch of treats, some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Except for that, I'm fighting. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you might be interested in the activities of moon-crap boy, then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend it to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
