It has been a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy and I had forgotten how idiotic it is. I would put this lightly in the two or three of Elvis Presley's worst movie. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull rider who returns to Arizona and the run-down cabin where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers any substance, comic or otherwise. The government has invested in the family's cattle, but they lack a bull. Elvis is going to sing only a couple of completely worthless songs, and is being pursued by a young boy shell gal and her weapon master. This is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the fake environment almost stinks in fertilizer and doesn't make it much easier. The only thing that puzzles me, however, is that Elvis actually seems to have a good time in the movie. Hard to believe when he was so sad to get stuck by making so many mediocre movies.
