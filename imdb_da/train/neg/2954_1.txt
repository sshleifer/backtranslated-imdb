I see lots of bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's really a kind of hobby. Almost every Saturday night, a group of friends and I come together and see waste from around the globe - Something. Turkish superheroes, Brazil vampire flicks, Italian gorilla graft films, Kevin Costner movies, anything (except perhaps Raising Helen), but I've never seen a WORST movie than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even entertainingly bad in an Ed Wood way - it just sucks. Now this movie was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off his gloves and made it clear to the press and everyone else who would hear that she heard this point of CRAP = she was trying to get out of her contract, she whined, she moaned, yet they pour her fat butt into this leather skins dense futuristic cop uniform that is horrible to see, yikes !!!! And you can just see her seething during take - do everything but look out the camera for her agent so she can scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions, and the script is so terrible that a third-class class could do a better job if promised cookies.
