Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson takes and respectfully takes the short book of the same name for the big screen in a full-length movie. While respecting what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the movie seemed to have been lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing he is a talented man and if it happened to be a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making so I have to release him. I will admit that it had a wisdom and good spirit for it, and the animation is great, but the movie is becoming increasingly difficult to enter, leaving the story behind and having random pictures of random things. The signs are also good. Jason Schwartzman votes with Mr. Fox (George Clooney )'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging. The movie doesn't make it to a level of horror, but it gets closer and closer when it goes on. I'm sure Wes Anderson will come back on track with another great movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but for the moment I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, your movie was a big disappointment.
