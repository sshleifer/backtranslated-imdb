My 7-year-old daughter loved it, as Disney's execution in vain estimated she wanted. That's the problem with "Air Buddies." It is a strictly-narrative children's film filled with carefully calculated beauty, a few politically correct morals and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent, or even a 10-year-old, you've seen it all before and done better before. Think "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and you get the general idea. I believe that a good children's story is a good story, period. "Air Buddies", which are as original as recycled paper, do not comply with the standard. It's not the worst video your child can see, but there are many better ones.
