I can happily remember Bo Derek's heyday and the British press focus (the special Sun & News of the Worlds papers in particular) - everyone follows his little role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, much of his photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed jumping breasts were made. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, plays and never were, her forte! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the DVD-drawers - Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these movies could be nominated for "So Bad, They're Great". It would be a guilty "buy" of me! Should you ever read your press or this comment, Mrs Derek, please be offended - Always have a soft spot for you and there are more important things in the world that worry about you than your ability to act. Very love.x
