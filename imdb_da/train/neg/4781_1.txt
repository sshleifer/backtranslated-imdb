This may be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. Authors and producers should study German films from the thirties and eighties. They knew how to sell. Even Soviet clunky leader as godlike father figure was better finished. Disappointing. The loss of faith was recovered in the church at the last minute just in time, because Dad was "saved" by Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, it seemed premature and not nearly melodramatic enough. A few foggy heavenly shots of the English Hoover up in the corner of the screen - brilliant and nodding - would have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover, who only saves the deserving family and children who had "proven" their worth. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people were portrayed as pleasant and even good - but Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would have been shot by those who drink spirits to show justice in their state. Finally, bright and cheerful recovery scenes (after Hoover saved the country from depression) should have rolled in the end. We could see how the Hoover God had saved not only this deserving family, but all they really deserved. Amateur at best.
