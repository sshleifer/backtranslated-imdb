I just recorded to make this comment (which basically echoes some of them already here) The play is worse than subpar, it shows on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst writings of tasteful female objectification (all bod no brain) and has some of the cheesiest lines you know of. <br /> <br /> including but not limited to "okay, we can see what these guys can do." I should also mention that when they show collapse with innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and starting to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black people who just rub people in the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow this kind of character research. Want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the evil? Oceans 11. This movie just hates the bad guys instead of catching the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars can't make up for this fly of a movie. The Enzo, which Griffin destroyed, summarizes this movie perfectly. It just sucks.
