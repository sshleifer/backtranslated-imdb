All of these reviewers are spot on. I have seen many bad movies over the years, believe me and it beats a lot! <br /> <br /> It's not just a "so bad, it's good" provider waste of time, but a real, fun, movie cruelty. <br /> <br /> CHECK the white furry monster type thing! <br /> <br /> READ YOURSELF ON Thom Christopher's "spell-weaving" acting! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISB! on the wireless sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of the "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear that some of the people who participate in the 'Wizard's guides' are not aware that they are appearing in a movie! FACTS! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep reception. I had to track a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really that terrible. It is. Even worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more ridiculous than all John Derek's films, this is really Citizen Kane of Trash.
