I came into this movie that really wanted to lens it. I thought the assumption had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don't make me mistake here, I didn't expect Citizen Kane, I took this to B-movie as it is. That said, it still fell below expectations. The historical aspect of history is glazed and the end left me a little cold. The action in the movie was a lot of wood. All in all, I give it a good idea, but the film could have scored much higher with a little more attention to film production. Is it worth seeing? I didn't want for my two hours back, but I don't know I would recommend it to others.
