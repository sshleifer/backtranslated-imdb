This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. The story was dull, the dialogue was horrible and the working hammy. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like one. It is not even very successful in its central impression of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The white horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way to hide cuts.
