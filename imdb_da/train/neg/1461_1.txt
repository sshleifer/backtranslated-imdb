I saw that movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler He is a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The Movie is, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler had never hit anyone, he would not hit people with his fist, but with the soldiers' fists. Understand?? Another thing is: It is too obvious that Hitler is the evil one he was more clever than it showed in this movie. No German would have accepted him as a leader because he can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler has not shown his evil side to the people. Have any of you considered the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? This is a great movie with great actors. And it's a German movie. I think that this theme for Nazi Germany should not be realized as a movie of people who do not know anything about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad period for people around the world .
