Boring. Minimal plot. No sign development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It could have been a great movie. It might have been a cult classic. No, it was a huge relaxation. It was badly thrown and had terrible special effects. It was hard to decide who was the evil one: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I still get confused by some mini-plots from the movie. I am left dumbfounded on certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which has never been completely explained. I felt I saw a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It seemed a lot like a movie for television. Don't watch this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
