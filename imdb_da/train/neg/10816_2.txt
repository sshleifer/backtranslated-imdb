Oh just what I needed, another movie of 19th century England. Which is pretty much like regular England, just no vandalizing football stadiums. In this picturesque setting of gentlemen, ladies and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg goes round without a word like Jane Eyre, from that novel no one has ever read willingly. Jane usually hangs out in Mr.Rochester's crib, where she tries to teach a French girl to look at a blank board all the time. One day Mr.Rochester (William Hurt on auto-pilot) comes back to fall in love with Jane and all that, but there is still the question of his cakes wife locked in the ceiling. Open, it was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some gently scattered fire (they probably rented the set), the movie finally comes to an end. Everything looked really authentic, it's something I guess. But then again, nah.
