**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the most fun comedies ever created for the screen. Absolutely impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take a great novel to list all the comedy routines in it. During her program, Carol Burnett and the company, which often started filming, were skewed in a way that was hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly became ill with only a small cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around and wondered where it came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with floating locks and looked almost like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing more fun than this bit is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene at the end. Jenny really looks as if she dies okay ... to die for her makeup artist to come in and give her a little color. And of course we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get to bed with them during the patient's last moments. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie industry is an instant classic. He had lots to worry about. He never came back from this.
