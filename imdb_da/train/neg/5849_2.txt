Being a fan of silent movies, I looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> As has been mentioned, the movie seems to be a long, long commercial for Maxwell car. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the chase scene was about half that length, then I may have had the movie more. But it grew old very quickly. And while I recognize that reality has been stretched many times in movies without diminishing the enjoyment of the viewer, what was the Mexican bandits? I think they are chasing a car through the mountains, a car that mostly moves about one kilometer an hour, but they can't get it?
