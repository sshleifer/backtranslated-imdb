The Honey I shriveled the kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. I loved Honey, I shrank the kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting plot! The sets were so amazing, and the casting seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. Now, honey, I blasted the baby was pretty stupid so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a little more grown up now and her mother is on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite subject is threatened by the waste, he will shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son, they also get caught in the machine and leave the children alone in the house! <br /> <br /> The reason is stupid, but as I said, it was just a family movie that I think some might get a kick out of. The original Honey, I Shrunk Kids is the best I think everyone can agree. The third was not that bad, I would recommend this one at least over Honey, the Blew Up the Kid movie, at least it was a little fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
