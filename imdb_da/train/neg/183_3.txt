This is an action Western. James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest that is filmed in great splendor. Landscape and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs a curly government in the old Northeast. <br /> <br /> The biggest drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart portraits really have some saving graces. He is kind to his two partners and it gives him an extra dimension of credibility and equality. But he's so piggish for everyone else, it's hard to really care for him or to accept him. He is much like the one-dimensional spaghetti western characters (not so bad). <br /> <br /> But the little characters are still fun. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make this worth seeing.
