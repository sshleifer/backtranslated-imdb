Screenwriter Lisa Lutz started writing the manuscript at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /> <br /> Is she even in business? If someone gave her a chance again after this shot, she is ready for the most fortunate person ever to be awarded. This movie sucks at no end ... It never ceases to amaze me what it turns into movies ... and the fact that they got this writer discouraged too little? Seriously? I can write better crap than this in my sleep. <br /> <br /> So how many lines should I write? I don't get it at all. I think I'm a beginner. I suppose I don't understand why there should ever be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? I don't care if you have a phrase ... I can even answer a word. I mean, let's say that. <br /> <br /> Thank you ... is that enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is worthless.
