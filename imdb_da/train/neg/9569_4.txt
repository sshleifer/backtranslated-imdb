Certainly not terrible, but definitely not good. Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written to the screen by Ronald Harwood (adapted from Alan Paton's 1946 novel). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about pre-apartheid South Africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man mix. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying he should come immediately; He later finds that his son has killed a man. Rich farmer James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a black rights champion, was the one killed by Kumalo's son. In this they connect. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to the 1951 movie of the same name, because I haven't seen it. Or 1974 musical title Lost in the Stars, for I have not seen it either; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I've seen; It has a much more urgent air for it, as though it is actually trying to say something where the movie Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it goes. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the movie with the novel (except that I enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the movie), because novels and movies are two very different media, and there is no point in trying to transfer directly to each other or compare them in the same way . <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was blowing. Well, it wasn't that bad, -Five-out-of-the-ten - but it wasn't that good either. Both leaders, both very talented actors, draw some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most unpleasant movie history dialogues (but that may be due to his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also strangely off, games with this movie , has also written the sublime pianist and be Julia). Among other things, the novel's point and themes are almost excluded in its transition to film for the third time; There is little, if any, excitement with any moment in the movie, racial or exciting. The music doesn't help. The painfully displaced and non-boring pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling of the movie. One upward is the cinematography, with many pretty good or beautiful pictures, but unfortunately it doesn't help the movie too much. <br /> <br /> The last striking words of Alan Paton's novel appear in the last moments of the movie. It's too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the movie that was just shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela could have seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
