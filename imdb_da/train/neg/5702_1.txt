What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but this one was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable, and at a certain time I found myself sighing all the time. I can't believe people actually liked this movie. Nicholas Cage's role was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a grand tour around America's most sought after buildings. The never-ending flow of hints and combinations was not convincing either. I stopped the attention about 30 minutes. What was going to be a good evening was a total disappointment. What a move ... I think I've just seen too many movies to enjoy the National Treasure.
