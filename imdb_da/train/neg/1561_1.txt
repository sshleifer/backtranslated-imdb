Anyone who gave this movie rave reviews should see more movies. <br /> <br /> A loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family. The film is filled with idiots and contains live "teabagging". It should sum it all up for you. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. You may want to watch the whole movie in the hope that it will get better as it does - it doesn't!
