Wow, not only this movie is a "new lesson in really bad taste", but also a lesson in "really bad filmmaking." Don't make me wrong, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence', but at the same time, one must realize when a movie is horrible. If you miss the story, it's about 'Zombie' 90 'about a government plan that carries toxic chemicals that then coincide with the desert and causes the chemicals to spill, and make the locals scary looking for zombies. The next thing you know is zombies everywhere in the city who eat people alive, while a divine physician and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that makes these people eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence." From then on, everything we see is zombies that have a market in every room in sight - nothing but extreme and pathological disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless pants of gut and gore. As this is a German movie, the movie should be dubbed in English, and when you don't laugh at the zombie feeding pleasure, voice-overs are also hilarious and entertaining. Using UnratedX mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and not acceptable and thus the scene where a woman carrying her infant is rolled around in his wheelchair by some guy and a horde of zombies come out of nothing and attack them. A zombie grabs the child and rips it and eats its organs when you hear the baby crying. Wow, it's a new lesson in really bad taste. Despicably I tell you, terribly.
