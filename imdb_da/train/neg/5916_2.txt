The horribly slow pace of this movie was probably the director's explicit intention to convey how life was as an adult as a village teen in China. However, I found the combination of the glacial slow plot and the general film style so impersonal that it was completely alienating, especially to a western audience. At times I actually had trouble telling some signs apart when they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was completely past care. As a person who is not only interested in music but also very much into China's history and culture (and, incidentally, is no stranger to Chinese cinema), I could not engage in a single character and found nothing to get the teeth in . It asks the question: If I didn't like it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of almost every other Chinese instructor I've ever seen. This boring effort does not measure up at all. I would be sorry to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.
