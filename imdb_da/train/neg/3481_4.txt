May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say that, but anyone enough to read this can figure out that each plot is right from the start. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie where I liked. I didn't hate it in the way of some movies that offend your intelligence, but it all felt too predictable on its despite the necessary happy ending. There were fun pieces along the way to be safe, but few were original. At least it didn't go to the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh and Ben Affleck is working hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature. Everyone else is a cardboard cut, including surprisingly James Gandolfini, who must have done this for the benefit of anyone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minute.
