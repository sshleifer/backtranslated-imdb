This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story is weak - I couldn't even follow it. The action is high-schoolish. The soundtrack is annoying. Attempts at humor are not. The editing is horrible. The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to get my name associated with this waste of film. Don't waste your time, even thinking about this attempt to act.
