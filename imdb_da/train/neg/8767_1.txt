Is this the movie ??? Is that what the Indians are trying to show ?? I think it is an extra effort from a disease director to dismantle Pakistani soldiers and actual country .... but what we Pakistani know is that we are always ahead of India in all parts of our lives ... not just in armed counters . Well ... it's badly filmed as Border in early 1997 ... and the director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in Kargil by Pakistani armed forces by creating films like these .. <br /> < br /> One thing is very clear ... When there will be a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tries to make some good movies instead of Nonsense movies like this
