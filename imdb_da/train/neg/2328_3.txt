I saw it recently, and I have to say that I was moved by the factual basis of history. But "Holly" as a movie didn't quite work. However, I am looking forward to seeing the documentary film made by the producers who organized this project because I think it would be a far more convincing job than this film. The international cast was composed of B-class actors, but their action was appropriate, and I must mention in particular the young actress who played Holly. This was her first movie role, and she did a very nice job as she was the most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was sufficient but bland as Patrick, the American whose mission is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, his final role. Unfortunately, both of these actors, despite my mostly favorable view of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, were very forgettable and did not do their best work in this movie. I believe in the film's message and intent, but I have to be fair, so I rate "Holly" 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie. But I think the topic deserves serious consideration, and I am delighted that the people behind this movie have also made a documentary that I hope will have its debut on the BBC and other television networks.
