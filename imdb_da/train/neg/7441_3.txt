To quote the movie, "It's better not to know. It's better to forget. Best of all to be abandoned." Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical improvements of a Hollywood horror movie, but horrible bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you want to be preached for the start. <br /> <br /> It's as if the author's cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by poor cop TV and a Jerry Springer show. Maybe for a movie like The Hitcher, not a Russian horror movie. The result is that a potentially large setting and some potentially big-going scenes are wasted and just stupid, not scary or meaningful.
