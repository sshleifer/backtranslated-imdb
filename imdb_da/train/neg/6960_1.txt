Having seen the first 20mn of Blanche (sorry I couldn't take more of it), I have now confirmed that she doesn't. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real French actors participating in this Pharisee piece of junk. It starts with a concept that has been successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moons le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film of anachronical tone / dialogue. This can produce brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" towards avoiding the dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the horse faced Lou Doillon destroys everything and Blanche instead of a comedy just becomes a horror movie. Scare to cinephiles who want to be amazed and shocked to see fine actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort, fighting in the midst of this splendid burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.
