On the "Trivia" page of the IMDb, the filmmakers argued that this film was circumcised by the studio to "simplify the plot". If so, this effort was a total failure, as this is one of the most incoherent stories I've ever seen in a movie - I would hate to see it before the plot was "simplified". <br /> <It is sad to see Warren with so little character going on, even though he cannot do anything with the insignificant material. It is interesting to see Caron in the 70's fashion instead of his Hollywood era glamor garb and persona, but it is boring to see her run unfortunately through this do-a-favor-to-her producer-man boy. She would actually later join and marry the instructor, instead - whoever you want to notice, never instructed anything again, but did strictly 1st or 2nd A.D. in tv from here out. It probably tells you right there. <br /> <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have an automatic love for American movies during this period, and this role adds perspective to Oates' otherwise amazing 1971 output (two - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand ). But "the detective of the 1940s as fish outside the water in the 1970s L.A." theme, which is the only thing the film really has to say, is sold too heavily in a way. A similar theme would be handled much more effectively two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye. And as much as Oates plays a hard-bitten guy on a three-year death attack, he would give his final performance in Bring Me, the leader of Alfredo Garcia. If you haven't seen them, don't waste your time with this!
