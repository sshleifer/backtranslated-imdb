This film was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The reason was stupid, right up to the end. It reminded me a lot about something that was squeezed out of the home video market in the 1980s. I would have given it one, but there were short moments when you could see the actors really really strenuous to make it worthwhile. I think the worst was the underwater scene being kept away from the quay. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no, and when someone we had to care about was running out of air, this air tank would work. I would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
