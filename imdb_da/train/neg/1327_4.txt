This horrible movie brings together all the Asian stereotypes you can imagine in a horrible package. Money clearing, wiped out Japanese businessmen are sending greasy, but beloved policeman Pat Morita to recovering industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he meets one down on the Jay Jay Len, who immediately refers to a murder victim like Jap and calls Morita Tojo. It's all downhill from there.
