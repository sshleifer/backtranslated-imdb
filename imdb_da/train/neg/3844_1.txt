First of all, I just want to tell everyone who saw this movie that the actor who played "Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a great actor, even though it doesn't say much about his filmography, he has been in several plays and musicals. He currently lives in Terrasse B.C. This is where I come from, he comes over to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Okay, now about the movie, I would not recommend it to anyone who has NOT seen it, because it is not a movie worth watching , The main reason I found it to be a bad movie, it's never in place, it continues to jump back in time, so a little hard to follow on some points, and secondly, it's really boring * laughs * though The play is amazing Movie just doesn't compare.
