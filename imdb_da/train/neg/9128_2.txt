Although one did not realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of the film and died before the film's release, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful to see. It is apparently a lampoon of Sax Rohmer's famous oriental villain, but it lacks some focus. The potential for satirical comment on the anti-Oriental overtones of Rohmer's concept is ignored. In fact, the film uses racist insults. There are hardly any real jokes or gags, just mostly actors acting idiotically and squirting boring lines. It is especially disturbing to see Sid Caesar forced to endure curses and rage to try to laugh. Most of the other actors scare themselves too. <br /> <br /> And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual roles of the eerie Fu Manchu, who tries to gather a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; He conveys an exciting warmth as a blacksmith when discussing his fetishist attachment to his lawnmower, and he is strangely moving as a manchu when expressing his love of English music entertainment. But for the most part, he plays both roles with a worn ugliness, and therefore sabotages additional comic possibilities. The seller's routines, where he revives his failing strength with electric shock, are extremely unpleasant; He seems too convincingly agonized to be fun. <br /> <br /> A pair of genuine witty lines, an appropriate slapstick piece of Burt Kwouk (Cato in PINK PANTHER movie) as one of Mukh's minions, and Helen Mirren's entertaining tracks cannot save that mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comic genius, they will not learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
