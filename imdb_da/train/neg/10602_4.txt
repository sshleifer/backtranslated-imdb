This movie is mostly shit and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme stars in this movie. There are some good action scenes in this movie, and the best ones are at the end of the movie. The act of this movie is so bad, and it's the worst deal I've ever seen, and the two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can't act at all. And this film must by far be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dame's worst movies he has made, and if you, what you need to see him in one of his amazing movies, watch Blood Sports, KickBoxes or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
