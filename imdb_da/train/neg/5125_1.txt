As a youth pastor, I heard good things about this movie. Then I looked at it. The action was not the best. It is forgiven. It is the message that is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All that Jesus transforms magical awful subdued weak into all-American athletes. I laughed aloud when a coach quoted the script to explain the kicker why he lacked field goals. But wait, that's not all. You get a whole new truck, a $ 6,000 increase, and you and your wife's fight with infertility will suddenly end up in pregnancy - twice. Then you win the state championship because God helps a swinging kick the winning field goal 12 meters longer than he has ever kicked before - and into the wind no less - all for "God wanted him to do it." Then you will win the championship again next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus, would all their hearts. <br /> <br /> Here's what I took away from the movie: God can do whatever He wants to do when He wants to do it - and it's about making our lives better, easier, and more comfortable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. What Bible is this story based on? I bet that St. Stephen would have known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed to follow Jesus. It would have saved them all a lot of trouble.
