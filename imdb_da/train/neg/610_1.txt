I bought this movie on the cheap in a sale, after reading the back of the DVD case and assuming I can't lose it either, if it was something bad, so no loss, if it was good, then negotiated ... <br /> So I saw it ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie he ordered very little screen presence, apparently not doing A whole lot of even his friend's death near the beginning, like sparks of "action" in the plot, seems to affect him very little, and his possible revenge is just boring and unruly. <br /> <br /> Normally, a movie that has themes like grand like revolution and revenge is able to capture the audience and snare them to feel something for the characters, but seeing this movie felt more like seeing a row confused and almost random events loosely bound to the final conclusion ... <br /> <br /> At this time, I was crying ... <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was the most terribly painful piece of view i have tonight been exposed to the scene where the pilot sacrifices by refusing to jump out of the explosive truck because he does not want to kill any civilians, is not so much tragic sad as it is unpleasantly terrible and painful, although it is not as bad as acute surgery on the wounded girl. The play was poor all the way around, the manuscript and the story were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and "visuals" were not quite as visual. To sum up, there are great movies, movies that are bad, movies that are so bad, they are good, movies are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then at a whole new level is "McBain "
