The movie itself is not that bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious shortcomings of the script, but it can be seen. What really gives me the creeps is that people like Justin Timberlake themselves are thrown into movies, and in addition to movies like this. I must admit that I had never heard a man's name before I looked at it, but at the same time he thought I was just annoyed. The voice is rude, the face is a bad rip-off of Legolas, the attitude is horrible, and he can't even properly coordinate all three of them. Said to say, I was happy when he left after leaving the disco, because from that time I hoped it would only be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance and they are the main reason why I give this a 4. <br /> <br /> I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast ... and can't believe it .
