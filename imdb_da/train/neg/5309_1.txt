I watched the movie late one night on cable and couldn't believe how bad it was. I usually like bad movies, but one was so disgusting that it wasn't even entertaining. Some of the heights in this movie are the absurd music that is constantly playing in the movie, the hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun, they become neon green and immediately disintegrate) and the obnoxious play. Actually, the action is what I feel, steals the show. I didn't recognize any of the film's actors and I hope I'll never see any of them again. In general, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it; I can't imagine a video store that carries this waste) so you can learn to appreciate quality movies after seeing this garbage can.
