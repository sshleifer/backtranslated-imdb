I thought the movie was good in parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The camera angles for the first 30 minutes were strange and I didn't like the coz where they didn't cover the players altogether. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie was really not that great as we expect much in the case of such movies. The dialogues did not make sense, and I do not think they were very witty. I felt they were trying to copy movies as phonebooth in the form of dialogues, but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> the whole movie is only allowed and caine. I don't think it was a waste of time, it's an OK movie, but not GR8
