With a cast British actress and a comfortable photograph of the 1950s Britain I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this movie. Unfortunately I found myself adhering to it for the wrong reasons - I couldn't quite believe how terrible it was. I must have seen thousands of old movies and am always ready to allow quotas to be products of their time, but it was really hard to go. As others have noted, a major problem is that it does not. It does not seem to know what it will be: a mild romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a little gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke in song in 15 minutes in! It's not credible at any level, either the story itself or the fact that Daisy never seems to have an ounce of threat in her at any time. Other aspects that despite the credibility included the casting of suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), That he has Diana Dors for a fianc√© and doesn't seem to have the slightest interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on! ) And a ridiculous scene in a song publisher's office. It's all stupid in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> If I were to choose a favorite scene, it would be one in the beginning with the wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after all, it went downhill in a big road.
