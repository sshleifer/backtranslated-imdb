If the crew behind "Zombie Chronicles" ever reads this, here are some adolescents: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twist Ending" type movie, it is not a good idea to insert close-ups of every death in the movie in opening credits. It tends to ruin the twists, okay ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you produced this on a shadow, and to be fair, you worked miracles with your budget, but please hire people who can actually act. Or at least walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to put part of your movie in the past, just do it if you have props and costumes of the time. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist endings should be a surprise. Sure, we don't want phrases that don't make sense, but signage "reveals" as soon as you introduce a character? It's not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the boy to try, but honestly, I'd rather they didn't ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie finishers.
