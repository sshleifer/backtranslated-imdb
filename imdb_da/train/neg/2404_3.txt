Man, I was disappointed. 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from "Friends" <br /> 2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie is suffering from horrible pacing. It jumps around in a jumbled, confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) History doesn't even make sense. Why does he want to break the football line? What about the stupid violin music? None of that is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even fun. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to make improv and say "Look at me! Look at me, I'm fun!" This was a bad attempt to make another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen's movies, but he failed here. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Terribly disappointed.
