I really wanted to like this movie much more than I did. That's because I love crazy foreign comedies - especially the weird ones who catch you quite surprisingly. But although this often surprised me, it was almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park that almost every social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, the drug was abused (of almost all kinds - ranging from jar, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc. pedophilia. Mother encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years old) to sleep with neighbor men. In fact, at some point in the film, she gives this boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Fun?! You must be kidding. This movie just goes too far and dives into the "Comedy" black hole. What should they do next to cancer, cancer or rectal tumors?
