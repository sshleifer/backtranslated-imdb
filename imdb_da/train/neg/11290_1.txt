By far the worst movie all the time. Even Yaphet Kotto couldn't save this turkey. I have heard that the movie was originally titled "The Treasure", but was changed to "Sharks Treasure" to exploit the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in a scene of this movie; The fact that they happened to be in this "thriller" had to sell tickets. Didn't work. Whenever something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew skips each other with a particular beer brand that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Oh, do you think beer could have been a sponsor? Could they have made it more obvious? The only time anyone should break out beer is if they do it through this thing. That's enough to celebrate.
