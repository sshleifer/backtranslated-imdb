Oh God. I bought this movie and ... I ... so ... it ... all ... stuff. . . Okay, it's gonna be okay ... I know I'll be okay in a month or two. Some time soon I hope to get rid of flashbacks. I had to eat something after the movie, but I just don't like coming up trying to keep food down at the moment. Bath? Yes bad. Very bad. BATHING BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH. Wait, bad doesn't seem to get the message in the right way. Hmm ... There is no word to describe just how horrible .... not terrible ... Hmm disgusting horribly thrown / acted / filmed / directed / written. Now I don't know what to do, but throw it out. Possibly burn it, I didn't want it to end at the bottom of an architectural grave thousand years from now. The worst movie ever since "Hey Happy"
