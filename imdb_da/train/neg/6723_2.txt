Charlotte's deadly beauty and mortal kicks make the movie cooler than it would otherwise be. The story is so bad, and Charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if it was the end they had thought of this movie. I want someone to tell you that there is an alternative ending, but I fear it won't. As for the rest of the cst, well I would say that they simply didn't act very well; although the blame must be put on the poor script. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies in an absurd way when she had been the only one who had stolen the show throughout the film. I could give this movie 2/5
