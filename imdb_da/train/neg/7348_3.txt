I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was serial and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker, and I loved it. Then I saw Polyester and really kind of hated it. The only thing I liked about that movie was DIVINE. She / He had a hell of many talents. I was really surprised. As a whole I would not recommend this movie ...
