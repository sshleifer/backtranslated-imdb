Really interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The leading actress Stacey Walker is cast and oddly attractive. She looks like a fake Renee Zellweger with a bad hair. This chick made only two of these movies and then moved back to Texas. The music is horrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) with a different name. <br /> <br /> Best line in the movie from Tony - "Do you put me on the doll?" None of my chickens put me on. "Good B / W films from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locations (cool swimming pool also used in the DEFILES). Strange ending but appropriate. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker.
