Interesting? Almost. The "scientific evidence" that the film gives its point (it is fundamental that Jews are cancerous) is so stupid and paralyzed, it's almost ridiculous (if we didn't know what happened in that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Oh. I can't imagine the Germans (even in the wrong time) wanting to or believe in this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumph of Will. Now I was the movie I was impressed with. This is just stupid waste. "Best" part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the Jew the so-called preacher so blessed reminds us) Lorre plays a child-molester and killer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a bad mind can do it. Uh huh. Didn't know that M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even for it is the Nazi propaganda genre. 10.2.
