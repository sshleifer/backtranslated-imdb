Western society has been fed with ideas that India is a poor country. Movies like these only make these beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it even more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. It is agreed that there are poor and homeless people in India, but why there is no representation of educated people, if not the successful ones. <br /> <br /> I completely hated the idea of ​​the movie depicting Patrick Swayze as another mother Teressa. In my opinion, this film has shown India in a very bad light that gives false notions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant just outside the airport so we don't have to go on the road so full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a different opinion on contemporary Indian society should look at "Monsoon Wedding".
