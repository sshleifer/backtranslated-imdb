This movie is horrible. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a small-town family in the mid-60s. The father, the principal of the school, goes through a crisis in the middle of life. Enter a beautiful teacher from the big city who begins to challenge her students' minds with some thoughtful things as if you are thinking of yourself. The principal does not agree with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder Wannabe Tara Frederick) is tired of the little urban lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning was not taught at her school. Shocking! Since this director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked on television, this film plays as a more adult version of a special school or a very special episode of one of the more common sitcoms.
