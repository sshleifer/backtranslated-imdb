Ohhh the brutality, ohhhh the dying race, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhh prejudice! Jeez, when is everything you cheat revisionists will stop analyzing Westerns to cry loudly? S ** t happens. If it offends your socially constructed feelings, go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, dull and very tiring celluloid waste - especially in the light of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen's presence. Nothing interesting or exciting here unless you are obsessed with the 19th century desert dentist. Maybe it has been a little better without the constant redirection of the outstanding Mexican guy with the bad tooth. A monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60s / 70s. Almost impossible to sit through the whole movie. I think I'd rather have my eyes open to the whole Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 Horses / 10-all dead a hell.
