With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this movie to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I saw the rest of it with the remote control in my hand, so fast forward was clear. So trite, so standard, you know what will happen in each scene. One can even predict the word word for words. This is one of those films that make one scratch their heads and say, "How was this movie ever made?" In an effort to say something positive, I add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But overall, if you have seen 5 Sci / fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
