This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says the play is amazing and the casting is fantastic, has never even seen mediocre cinema. Of course, the action is terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I want all the other "soaring" comments to have been made by people in connection with the filmmakers. I wasn't very impressed with the story but just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon landscapes and there was some decent filmography - but the casting was something but inspired. I think this film also makes an estimate of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in American culture has been ignored and perhaps lost, and to revive it is worthwhile and possible. It puts jokes on the wrong and all too obvious places and makes me believe it's written by the state or something. Back to the drawing board. For yourself to suggest that this movie deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like Harold and Maude, is completely retarded and in the same line of begging and pretensioning and "fun" as it is fierce in this movie.
