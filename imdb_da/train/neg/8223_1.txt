Absolutely, the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictions of this view may claim that this title should not be judged according to the same criteria as others, as it is an independent low budget film, but c'mon already ?? The amateur profession and the weak innovation are scary. <br /> <br /> Agree with everything that has been said about this movie, for example, the mind that is numbingly weak actor (when it is so bad, you take another step to shoot the scene, goddamn it) The thing I found most annoying was the overall lack of common sense in the manuscript, assuming that such a thing existed during production. There was obviously a lack of dialogue with respect for the viewers, the girls changed personalities several times, and they seemed to show absolutely no view of any rationality or even brains - five relatively appropriate girls against a small female psychopath ?? Once on her, why not you? The only thing that can be considered as a conquest for this title is that the camera does not leave the habit at all times, so the viewer sees everything from inside it - which is like the rest of the movie, a good idea executed terribly. <br /> <br /> ?? Oh and by the way, is this movie nothing like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title recorded with a handheld camera ?? This is an effect and not a move! Used wisely it can be breathtaking, but in this case it is an excuse for inadequate filmography.
