This movie is really weak. It plays on urban paranoia in the 70s / 80s and puts it in a school context. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not / are not problem areas, but this weak exploitation takes biscuits. Violence is beyond anything realistic imaginable, but in this case it is not the case with social issues, but a white, upper middle class student uses it to make himself the criminal girl of his local college. And of course he knows how to play the system. Sounds well known. Yes. This turd is pure violent exploitation, a really unpleasant job. It is disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment. This belongs to the same category as trash can as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only noteworthy thing is that Michael Fox was so crushed at the time he had to do things like this.
