I'm sure deep in the recesses of Jack Black's mind character of Nacho Libre is absolutely fun, but no it isn't. You can tell ol Jacks, who has a whale of once hammin, it plays a smaller, slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler, but this movie is a total misfire in almost every department. <br /> <br /> I was right there most of the movie thought "Should it be fun" and "This is the guy from Tenacious D right?". The truth is this movie has nothing to offer. AT ALL! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff plays and direction. You will see endless moments when you think something funny will happen, but it just doesn't. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in, but though it would definitely pick up. It didn't. 90 minutes later I had hardly managed to avert an aneurysm, it was so painful. It's like, remember years ago, when you wanted to see something with your favorite actor in it, even some of their really early papers before they were famous, and you'd be very embarrassed that that actor was actually in such a plop. Yes it is. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier films like Shallow Hall, and I'm really looking forward to seeing the Pick of Destiny, but come on man. If you do this to us again, I have to get around and hammer your kneecaps or something. At least you give a serious conversation. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons ...
