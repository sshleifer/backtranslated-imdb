I'm even a big fan of the low budget 80's horror movie. This is not the worst, but still not spectacular. The baseline is decent, but pulls out too long. You are through half of the movie before you even see any zombie action. The killers are not very creative, and the zombies are not too clever. I really think this movie would have been better if they released the zombies and just made it a mafia girl. It can be seen, but I feel that this movie stole at least an hour in my life. I want to give the movie credit to be something original. If you're really into B-horror movies, it's worth seeing, but if you're not, don't bother. But you don't have to take my word for it.
