There are no spoilers here ... Because there's no plot to destroy. Madchen Amick's living proof a face can make a living spectacle - no talent required. The only bright spot is a couple of really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige, but then again she is Alice Krige. Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint of how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. She is faithfully scary in this otherwise incredible plot. How they made her accept this project remains a mystery. The scriptwriters must have been medicated when submitting this script. It has great continuity problems, superficial stereotypical signs, scary formula writing, and simply needs to make any sense whatsoever. The creatures, while having nice skills like going "dim", the question of where they come from and what they are, are never so much explored. <br /> <br /> Don't waste any time on this.
