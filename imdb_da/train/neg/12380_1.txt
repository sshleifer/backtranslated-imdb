The creativity of this movie was lost from the beginning when the authors and directors released a good storyline only to replace with horrible special effects. This movie seemed to be focused on entertaining children, but couldn't even reach it. Many small low-cost films have the potential to be good movies, but this movie is not how close it is. Fortunately, it will be another movie that is easily made and easily forgotten. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to make some money on the page until their chance came together for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a bunch of respect for movies should avoid watching this movie at all costs.
