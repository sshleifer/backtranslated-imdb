This movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately, they had forgotten how to act. I hoped the movie would be better when it went together, but the play was so robust it was judged from the start. It actually turned out that the actors might read from a script all the time. Maybe it was Musical score or the director himself, but one thing is for sure that the Make-up artist must have another job! The face powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors' faces! Would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it never hit theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shame on you for not giving it to all of you. The reason was great, just needed a lot more.
