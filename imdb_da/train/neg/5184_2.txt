I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but was disappointed at many levels. First of all, the story is so much recycled that it becomes almost unbearable. Secondly, the setting, play and story are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many more good black actors to choose from than these standard choices. What about some originality? Third, there were very few Hip Hop songs played throughout - if any. No seemd really central. Overall, movies were a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and made almost worth the movie.
