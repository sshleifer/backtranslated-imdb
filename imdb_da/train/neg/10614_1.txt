This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen very few movies. It is rejected as an art film, but it is really a piece of waste. It's a redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dance, but it can't make up for Sally Potter's eerily obvious tribute to himself. The reason for this movie is non-existent and I guarantee you will start laughing at the end. Especially where she starts singing. It is completely unreal.
