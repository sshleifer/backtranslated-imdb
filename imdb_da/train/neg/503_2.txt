After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scratch the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO Bloodsuckers everywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious counter invites several actresses to his castle for a small holiday. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans, the girls are decapitated one by one. Who's the killer? Who knows? There are more red herring in this than on the local fish market on Friday. The pace is scary. The story is stupid, and the skin scenes are not so wonderful either. <br /> <br /> Give this a lady.
