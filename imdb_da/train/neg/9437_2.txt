I have never really considered much of "students" when it comes to watching movies I see them forming, making sense, and that's it. But Unhinged changed all this. This movie is undoubtedly the most eerie attempt at film production I've ever seen. Every child throwing up at the university, thinking that they will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino, will be handed over to this movie with a handbook titled "How not to make a movie". Not only is there no story to be, movie makers were not even competent enough to make a movie worth seeing. It's been a while since I saw it, but all I can say is to see overhead tracking shots in opening scenes. They never stop! It's almost like having your teeth pulled, just not that fun.
