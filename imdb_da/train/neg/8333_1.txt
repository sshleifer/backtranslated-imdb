This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. The action is poor, and the story is almost incomprehensible. Whether you think of light ships or ships for that matter, it is irrelevant. With regard to special effects, the film has none. The entire movie staff was probably on the boat out in hard sea instead of in a studio, and when some of the men are "stung" (if you can even call it), their reactions are completely unreal. Guns are quieter than a dumb. How this movie could have a two prizes puts serious questions to the human state of mind. Well, that's it. This review is probably more fun to read than the movie is to watch. If anyone is considering seeing it or buying it, I will seriously advise you against this for obvious reasons. I have said it contains a spoiler. If the fact that some people get stuck and a gun gets fired, is a plot giveaway. It is assumed that this is because they are the only good parts of the film.
