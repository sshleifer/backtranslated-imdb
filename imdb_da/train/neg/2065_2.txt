Rented it last night. The opening (2001) drove WAAAAAAAAY too long. The Hitchiker scene did not serve any purpose. Some sketches were just retarded. I knew beforehand that the Chevy Chase was in less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> COOK, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie <br /> < Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell. Let me give you some advice: If you want a raw movie spoofing TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less raw film spoof on TV and movies, hire "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> Otherwise, do not rent this movie. You save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Movies Are Still "Modern Issues"
