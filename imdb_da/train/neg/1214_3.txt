A friend asked me to read a play by his who had been chosen by a film studio. To say that it was one of the most inappropriate and inappropriate scripts I had ever read would be a bold understatement. Yet I have never told him this. Why? Because in a world where movies like "While She Was Out" can turn green and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a play without content, content, and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell. <As many other reviewers have pointed out, "While She Was Out" is a terribly signed Woman-in-Peril movie that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely caps on Christmas Eve. Every grip is legitimate, from the weak dialogue and bad action to the jaw lapses logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are a few things that struck me: <br /> <br /> I don't care how much we should think her husband is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. Since then, has it become child abuse to get the children to fetch themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially varied gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Sure the movie is stupid. But it's also the myriad "thrillers" I've put through, where the women are portrayed as regrettable, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman get the best of her ailments. <br /> <br /> 4) I LOVED the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous reviewer believed this sentence, I really think this movie should be retrieved "The Red Toolbox of Doom."
