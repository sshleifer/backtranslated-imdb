[I even watched this movie late in a public television station, so I don't know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) which Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s. It's hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little movie that today might just be considered this page of "kiddie porn". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple stars in a roll that is likely to have an average of 5 years. They are all in diapers and are in a salon that serves milk instead of alcohol. "Cash" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "femme fatal" sashays up to the bar and speaks to soldiers giving suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley doesn't really need their lollipops / cash because her purse is full of them from other "men". Meanwhile, a small black boy has a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). <br /> Which strange movie. . . infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a salon. Who thought about these things any way?
