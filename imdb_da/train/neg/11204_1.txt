:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was horrible. A Catholic / superstitious / thrilling thriller is already well over the tread from previous films. <br /> <br /> The doubting priest. Sex and priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy. The association involves the church. The day of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magic voodoo fights between good and evil. Pretty stupid and lame with a weak history to suffice. The story is about two concepts: Absolution, better known as Sacalment of Sifting the Sick - the last rights a person can ask to cleanse their sins while on the edge of death And excommunication, the act of cutting a person away from the church. Basically, an excommunicated person cannot receive Absolution. Thus comes His Eater, and I will leave it by. Throw in all the dopy things I've already mentioned and you have "The Order". I found the sex scene with the pastor intertwined with pictures of the Virgin Mary, who rather offended the Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (I rewrite) "I am the Redeemer of sin and damn I live without love blah blah blah" / cue him walking in the dark alley with long trench coat all "The Matrix". <Br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 1 not only to be crazy and unoriginal, but also because it managed to offend a whole faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
