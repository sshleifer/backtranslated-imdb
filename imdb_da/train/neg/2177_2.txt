The first notable problem of this awkwardly titled film is its molding. Ann Nelson plays grandma here. Three years after that she would star in "Airplane!" like the woman hanging herself while listening to Robert Hay's guy for Julie Hagerty. I couldn't get that picture out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is a fifteen year old with trouble. He has a headache. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a massive heart attack. A chain-buying psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is doing with this family. First, she mesmerizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a flashback story that fills the entire first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and Grandfather bought an RV, cheap and driving it around to all the tourist traps in the desert of California. Rv soon has a mind, goes away from the road and such. Then big boulders start to throw themselves at it. The elderly couple are appropriately scared, but remain in the vehicle to move the plot together. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the RV taken when going to another unplanned trip. <br /> <br /> Boston's mother starts talking to some Indian mummies she's been lying around in the house. She has a writer for herself and makes abundant notes about the moldy body. Psychiatrists read the detailed notes and use her imagination to fill in the topics. We see the mother half flip out, but her mental breakdown happens offscreen, like Gramps' heart attack. Finally, the patient is the resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own story. He believes that mother is about to leave (it was made in 1977). Apparently, the mom makes the astral bodies of the native American mummies kind of fly through the air. A blow Matt as a bee hits a windshield, and Matt begins to trade everything crazy. The psychiatrist takes the grandmother and Matt into the desert. Matt is inexplicable in a wheelchair now, and the trio confronts the unseen (and unexplained) forces. <br/> <br /> Flocker has no meaning for stage design. One pro here involves RV stranded in a salt flat in the desert. In the distance, the pair discovers some rock waves rolling towards the RV. This is a pretty scary little scene that is eventually handed over. As the mountains begin to plunge against the vehicle, the special effects become evident. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the RV runs from the highway and then again take forever. The scenes where Grandpa is trapped on the RV taken as it usually down a dirt road takes forever. Mother's conversations with the mummy take forever. Matt is out of body experiences forever. This movie takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to fast forward the button at least a dozen times. As scenes dragged on, it was clearly Flocker padded. Cut the fat here and it would have clocked in an hour. The final "explanation" that the spirits of the mummies tried to kill them close to Matt, never holds water. Did the RV live? The filmmaker never brings up that the spirits are not good in their murderous ways, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> As I continued to think of Nelson in "Airplane!", I also thought of other movies. Everything to prevent me from falling asleep during this. Boston is terrible as the child, playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten year old who has a smart alecky line for all those adults who fall over themselves, love him. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Flocker has written and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise to make the audience feel unhappy. It's not scary, and like the ghosts, you can still walk away from this tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is not classified and contains some physical violence and mild profanity.
