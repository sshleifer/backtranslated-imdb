After a series of power cuts on a remote island zoo, genetically engineered sabertoo tigers are on the loose and oncoming residents of the island. Man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad "original" movies, but I think this may be their worst so far! This poorly written and directed "Jurassic Park" solution offers all the usual clich√©s (mad scientists who believe that people killed by the monsters are "consumable losses", signs that go down in long dark times alone, brain-killed teenager, which only works in the movie is to die a terrible death, etc.), and surprisingly no tension at all. The special effects are terrible ?? The doll animals in close-ups of the title beasties are bad enough, resembling rigid plush dolls, but the CGI, which makes the computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" look life-like by comparison, is just awful. There is something going on, but most of it looks a bit unreliable. Oh, and the scientist's death scene at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen this year. I couldn't even laugh it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, this is just pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting trivia for you? This movie borrowed music from the 2003 sci-fi movie "Alien Hunter", which was far better than this piece of crap.
