I love Columbo and have seen virtually all the episodes, but this is undoubtedly the worst of the party. A frighteningly dull, pointless, confused pile of relentless drifting wasting both the viewing time and the acting talents of a very boring Peter Falk. The plot, as it is, just seems to be compounded, as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients of the formula that made the show such an excellent success with. Part of the case, which I found extremely confusing (or possibly annoying) was, was Peter Falks character introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If producers insist on keeping Columbo's first name secret, why couldn't they omit this line at all, as it sounds ridiculous? As I said, it's pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.
