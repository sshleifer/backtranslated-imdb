Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, even though it is my favorite, Knappertsbusch, in 1951. Syberberg's entire approach is so static. When the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps throwing in motion at the same pace. It takes Amfortas and Klingsor to be endless. What happened to movie editing? The result is physically exhausting to see. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong. And does it decorate with the "clever" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there ever be a view of this movie without prior knowledge of Wagner?
