Cobra Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that gives full justice to whatever profit it has as a movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> It has a competent cast of neighbors that free themselves as one might expect under the circumstances. It is efficiently directed to sound phases and standing sets on the study's backlot. It looks good but is suddenly overwhelmed, and within 80 minutes it is still heavily padded. <br /> <br /> For example, double cobra attacks on the first of the GIs were probably an attack for many. <br /> <br /> The business of Julia choosing to marry Pete instead of Tom never answers. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa, and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia (nor is she). Julia's "feminine intuition" is introduced as if it will lead to an important plot development, but it does not. Likewise, Pete's study of cobra cultures and suspicion, which falls short on Tom, is no other purpose than to fill screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured as a mystery, but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is going, so the characters carefully monitor what we already know. The end is particularly boring. Julia is threatened by accident. Lisa has no reason to kill her - she is just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom turns up to save her, it's not even clear if she was threatened at all. He simply removes the cobra in the way one of the former victims could have done. <br /> <br /> It's such a tiny little pipsqueak of a story that I found myself wondering how on earth it was added to the studio head. Then it happened to me. Someone said, "The Val Lewton movies were very successful at RKO, so why don't we do that?" <br /> <br /> The cult of Cobra is clearly modeled on Cat People: mysterious, troubled, form-changing woman falls in love with the hero, apparently frigid, kills people, awakens suspicions of the hero's friend's friend and dies at the end. But 'modeled on' does not mean 'as good as' - with a wide margin. It copies, but does not understand what it is to copy. Of course, it is trying for the low-key, suggestive Lewton style, but this approach does not follow in the story. Lisa is no Irene. She is supposed to be strange and mysterious, but there is no mystery about her. We catch a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia, so immediately recognize her as she comes up in New York. There is never any doubt about her purpose. Nor is there any doubt whether she does not become a snake. <br /> <br /> Then again, during her nocturnal prowling, we don't get one but two attempts at 'buses'. Also, you must not go away because the director does not understand what does a 'bus' work, and in any case, they happen to the stalker, not the person who is stalked. <br /> <br /> These weak echoes of Cat People give Cobra's Cult any slight difference it may have, but they only draw attention to the gaping gap between original and imitation. Plagiarism may be the most sincere form of flattery, but I doubt whether Lewton or Tourneur was particularly flattered when this faint little hour suit came out.
