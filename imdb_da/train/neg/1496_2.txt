Evil Breed is a very strange slasher flick who unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the movie seems promising, but in general it is a disaster. The dialogue is rather poor, but not nearly as bad as the play. It is brutal and unbearable. The characters deliver there lines terribly, and although appropriate, the method does not work because the signs become annoying. some of the killings are innovative, but it took far too long to get to them. after approx. half an hour through the movie we get the first death (except in the beginning) and then almost all other characters are smoked within the next five minutes. The film then became a kind of spear with ridiculous-looking characters, unrealistic karate as fighting and a scene where a man gets his bowels pulled out of his vulnerability. None of it is fun, it's just pretty ridiculous. The movie becomes so ultra gory and ultra pointless.Most of the characters are klich√©d even for slasher standards and are as solid as but left on the counter for 5 days. Evil Breed is not even ridiculously bad, so it fails in the main task. See Texas Mainsaw Massacre, just before dawn or see no evil for a real slasher.
