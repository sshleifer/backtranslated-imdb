Here we are: Two travelers from a distant futuristic world come to earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life, another is an inhuman killer who is determined to remove the woman who wants to give birth for a whole race. <br /> <br /> So what could we call this killer? It's almost like he's a kind of destroyer or eradicator ... like an explorer or something. What is the word I'm looking for ... something that -termining-thing? Hmmmm .... Anyway, the protector (who quickly makes the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothing) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future born heroic being. The evil uhhhh ... "exterminator" kills some rednecks and steals their weapons and clothing and tries to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking herself to look threatening into people's eyes and repeating her name threateningly. <br /> <br /> Then, a desperate race for survival begins as the seemingly deadly and unstoppable "exterminator" pursues the couple across the landscape. At some point he can buy boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in an exciting finale he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge tanker full of. .. acid. Then the truck collides. They will be saved ... but no! He will then come back again, as strong as ever. He will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing system where, in a scary finish, he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopper and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I extrapolate too much ... after all, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnates Sean Young by kissing her in a bar and telling her that the baby is being born for 3 days. <br /> <br /> Costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them at Star Trek: Next Generation too! Sean Young makes another great trip as an unemotive Replicant, and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also aboard as Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend. Not sure where he fits into the plot though ... maybe he's an import from another James Cameron movie?
