Looking through the other comments, I am amazed that there are no warnings to potential viewers of what to look forward to when renting this waste. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competent made Indiana Jones profanity. What I got was one of the most offensive movies I can remember trying to get through, making it more shocking about the movie's relatively high production values. I don't think it's a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... If your idea of ​​entertainment sees Bimbo get raped from behind by terrible tribal chief while staring into the dead eyes of her significant other's cut head, by Everything means rent this flick. If not, I would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, the scene so briefly summarizes the movie that there is nothing else I really need to say about it.
