they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> Okay. First, I doubted, but after seeing the wise cloud, I changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons with people dead or alive. no safe sex of course. the (scary ugly) leading man shoots it all into the lady's mouth after he made the dead lady. never heard of HIV? Don't guess. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring but also incredibly disgusting. In fact, in parts, it became so disgusting that I couldn't take my virgin eyes away. sex with dead people! how rough is it? And what is the message behind it all? we need water, we need melons, we need to be dead to have sex? sorry, but it stinks!
