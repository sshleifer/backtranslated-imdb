The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in that light it delivers. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and gives a little more than a concise and one-dimensional study of "problems" without any insight at all. <br /> <br /> Make a movie about stereotypes and then make each character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely bad strategy - especially when the same characters only break their hackneyed molds into predictable, stereotyped ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the movie almost visible, and Michael Rappaport becomes a good performance, but the manuscript is so horrible, and the social commentary is so slow, it's hard to find something redeeming.
