This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but it's the worst I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of gore, but most deaths in this movie are not shown. It just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes they actually show in this movie are terrible. Of course, the graphics look fake. The actors are also terrible. There are no real feelings from any of them. Not only do I waste my time watching this piece of sh * t movie, but I had to submit to the animals being knocked at the beginning of it. If I could judge this a -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's bad. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it.
