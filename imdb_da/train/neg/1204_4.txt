I remember the Devil Dog, who played at TBS nearly 20 years ago, and my old sister and her friends saw it and laughed all day. It's not that bad for a customized movie for television, but it's derived (mostly by The Exorcist) and commercially because there's a better word. It won't blow you away with artistic film or great acting, but it's not a waste of time either. It's the kind of movie you're looking to kill a couple of hours when you're not in the mood to think too hard. <br /> <br /> But if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children in the Cursed Eyes, are hilarious non-threatening and the climatic screen effects of a huge black dog (with horns!) are beautiful side cuts. And watch out for the cloaked satanist in Maverick shades at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Not a big scary movie of any kind of fantasy, but I want them to still do things like this for TV.
