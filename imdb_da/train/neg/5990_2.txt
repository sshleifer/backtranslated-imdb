I still haven't seen all this; It runs on cable right now and I seem to continue to enter the middle of it. My main reason for being interested is that I am a Bill Paxton fan; He is a really good actor and has done a consistently good job during his career. The other thing is that while I am never really a fan of the old series, I liked the Thunderbirds for ships and effect work. Derek Meddings may have been the best in the company during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the international rescue vessel are wonderful. The current team has done a good job of translating its work into the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a lame story. The kids are asked to run it, and while doing an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brain's eight-year-old T2 flying son, a huge multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. . Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is far above the top here and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the movie on its very small benefits, Thunderbirds is a fun and fun trip. Just don't look too close to the machines that run it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all this and it's worse than I thought. The play is quite uniformly poor, and while the effects are quite good, the story of several views has become cheesier. The exaggerated product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as key figures congratulate on my remaining nerves. As with the Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is tolerable. But not much. See the original show and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a word for advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the director's guild. You can do better than this old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. At Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I almost came in the middle with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their battle scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I didn't think it was possible for an already boring movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> If this had been done right, no children had rescue, no heavy-in-cheek jokes it could have worked. Like that, it's just another beloved childhood joy that has been destroyed.
