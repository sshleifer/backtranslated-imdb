I didn't think it was possible, but I found movies worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really really bad! And what makes it worse is that it's another Australian movie ... Shots on what looks like VHS, and with a horrible 80s rock soundtrack it just gets worse and worse, which is hard to believe how bad the beginning is ( The skin he hangs up and down in a white tomato sauce sprayed someone's room?). <br /> <br /> And why do their accents change? From the bad New York drawl, to prissy English, so pure Aussie! And it happens with the whole role! <br /> <br /> This movie also claims to have won a film festival on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). This must be a lie because no one in their real mind would nominate this for something (maybe the Golden Rasberries, but I think it's too bad for that too). Come on, guys! This movie should be number 1 on the bottom 100 !!! It must be ten times bad as the movies already there. <br /> <br /> Well done to "movie" makers of this garbage to prove there's a reason not to watch movies ..... 0/10
