Okay, what the hell kind of TRASH have I seen now? "The Witches Mountain" has to be one of the most incoherent and crazy Spanish exploits ever, and yet it is also wonderfully convincing. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here, and I even doubt that there was ever a script to work with, but somehow I couldn't turn it off. Scratching your head with confusion immediately starts with an opening sequence of an angry little girl who killed her mother's cats. So you think this movie is about children who possess evil powers? Heck no, because after this intro the girl and her evil are simply not mentioned anymore. Then cut to a guy, with the most impressive chopped mustache you will ever see, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unbridled manner. When she asks him to spend her vacation with her, he immediately calls his employer and asks him for any task! Good move. The movie finally starts now as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks. But not until he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and shoots her topless! During their journey, all sorts of strange events appear that ?? you guessed it ?? is never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud noisy music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, car jacking witches? Apparently, the silence of the quiet witch owns the mountains, and they practice voodoo on violations. It's as close as I describe the plot, but is there a good chance that I'm out of the way? More importantly here is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is occasionally very creepy with its eerie music and interesting movies. The supportive characters all look scary and the amazing Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the type of European horror movie that could have been legendary if only someone had bothered to write a structured manuscript.
