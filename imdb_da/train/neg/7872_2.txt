Anyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake not to make in editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I can't write a sentence without exclamation marks!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs' was a pretty good family comedy with fun jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel copies bad receipe of the first. The fun parts could be counted on one side and maybe half of it. Clavier overplays her role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act as Lemercier (because she replaces her), but it is "grotesque". Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Although Muriel Robin can be fun by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she is not acting as she used to do. I know it should be hard to replace one that was good in a role (Lemercier won a César award for his role in the first movie), but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played ?? Lemercier plays her role! As for history, it's just too much! Of course, at the end of the first movie we knew there would be a sequel, but Poiré and Clavier should have tried to write a simpler story like the first episode. Gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, there are no more than 3 fun parts in this. The only good things can be costumes and some special effects. So you only have 2 reasons to see it: 1) If you want to learn how to edit a horrible movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment! 2.10
