I tried as hard as possible to sit through this annoying mess, but I just couldn't do it. Brad Dourif sucked quite like the lead, and all the supporters just got slightly worse. <br /> <br /> It's all just ridiculous, from the horrible spectacle to the ridiculous FX to the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Complete waste of time; do not want to. Root canal therapy would be more comfortable. Bamboo sheaths under the nails would be much more comfortable. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would only be a little worse than this. Get the idea?
