I am a massive fan of the book, and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity, Burton is an actor, I hold high regard, so when I heard he played the role of O'Brien, I was turned. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer on the DVD first and some fears began to set in, mainly with regard to the honestly horrible "theme song" that heard Eurythmics mechanically shouting "1984!" over and over to an electronic battle is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The action on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the excitement found in the Sanhedry's Ministry against the End can be felt, especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene. But this is also where the film has failed. The film spends too much time focusing on love affair between Winston and Julia, which honestly is not what Orwell wrote about. He wrote about a needy future, about how Ingsoc builds on a human conviction and then crushes them all in his name, made to love Big Brother. The film skips what is the most important part of the book, Winstons expresses in his life and world position and his re-education through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> Comment on IMDb Currently, it says that the film is sticking to the book, is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit to Goldstien's Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial cases where Winston finds the article with Unpersons, but it is mentioned near the end, if you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible manuscript that some outstanding plays cannot save. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point Orwell was trying to make, and the electronica soundtrack is frankly horrible.
