The first scanners might not have been a good movie, but it was at least original. There is no such news for this. The action is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. I did not like the dialogue and the special effects are no better than in the original. It's the movie is inferior to the first in every way. The only thing that is different about it is that it is loud and chaotic at times. But it does not. I have made a good movie. If they had done something better with the story and made it interesting, it could have been a decent movie. In fact, I could not get through it all without fast forwarding through it. For me, this is a forgettable movie and not much more. Despite all that, there are worse movies. In a generous mood, I give Scanners 2 and 4/10.
