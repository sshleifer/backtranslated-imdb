After stopping at the movie store to find something to see, we stumbled upon this. At least it looked appealing from the summary, so we gave it a try. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's actually fun! Oh, wait, talked too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the movie, the film turned into a disgusting conversion to basic, right Christian brainwashing. Not sure what is happening, but I think that the scriptwriter found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script and had no time to edit it because he had a CCK meeting to come with his friends from Westboro Church and his hood it is not clean. <br /> <br /> Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idioci. Much as video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a little cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie will make a trip worse. Unless you share feelings with anything moron came up with this story and want your Bible open in your lap while you see this and plan on how to convert your neighbors, don't waste your time. It is some of the worst junk that has come out for a very long time, and the radical religious nuts no longer need funding.
