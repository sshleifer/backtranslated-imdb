Here is another blasphemous European story where they burst their country's religion. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal blast of Catholics and / or the Catholic priest (and I'm not Catholic). This actually won an Oscar for visiting foreign films. This is probably due to the story that Catholics and religious beliefs generally look extremely weak. One of the main characters is priest, and he cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as nothing but an idiot. It is no wonder that the secular-dominated academy loved this movie. There is also some overpowering fool playing a guy who refrains from his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters mentioned in the story. Daughters turn to seduce the "Seminary" student (who says he studied for six years, but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie ?? !!! This is a disgrace and another excellent example of the branch's secular progressive bigotry, worldwide (not just Hollywood).
