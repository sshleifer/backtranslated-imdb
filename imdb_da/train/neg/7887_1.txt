... then they will have a decent place to submit this crap. Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is religious mumbo jumbo. I kept waiting for the "unthinkable evil" that was promised to me, but the "evil" in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five-year-old with learning difficulties. <br /> <br /> I can't believe they actually managed to find some big name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, it has always changed my mind about them and I will probably avoid everything they do in the future. I am also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer's name and the instructor's name to remember, as I want to avoid everything they do as tormented from now on. It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics send in here and say that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This can lead to more people being fooled as I was into believing that this film was nothing but religious preaching. It's good in the video store to get my money back to false advertising. Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted, so I thought it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
