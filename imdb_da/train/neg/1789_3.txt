Although I have had Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be especially grille. Maybe because I'm from another era and another country, but I found Crosby's continued references to the good old United States pleasantly at first, immediately after a while and then finally annoying. Don't make me wrong - I'm not anti-American at all - but it seemed that the Englishman couldn't do it right and / or needed this brave, so clever American visitor to show them the way. It's a "fish out of water" story, but unlike most movies of this kind, this time is the "fish" that has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the film, I've seen it a couple of times separated in a couple of years and get the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I saw another Crosby movie last night - Emperor's Waltz - and it also created the same reaction in me. And to my surprise, my wife - for what it's worth to be American - was found) Crosby "in your face being annoying. Too many references to Teddy Roosevelt as she puts it.) <br /> <br /> With regard to the premise of the movie, it is unique enough for its day, and of course it supports very well . The landscape and music are also good, just like the big costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig at William Bendix looks awful. Overall. For me this would be a much more fun picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but because he is in virtually every shot, it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.
