This kind of "inspiring" saccharin is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs its feelings as the greatest semaphore on earth. It removes the audience's own interpretation and feeling by making choices for it. The big finish swims in crying orchestration, which must act as jumper cables on a dead car; I suppose you would need such an incentive to feel if you are stupid enough to watch a movie as simple and juicy as this. Streep lights up and you wonder if she really has the feel of the touch on the screen, or if it is just --- a screen, turned on and off like a light. Because I can't see for my life how she might find life in such a movie. Although it's based on a true story and an inspiring one, I'm sure the setup, performance, and performance will play as a third-rate television movie or half-high school drama.
