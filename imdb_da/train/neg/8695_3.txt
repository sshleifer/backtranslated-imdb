Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress for all the Law and Order ADAs, and her acting is even worse here. Her attempt at a Texas accent is amateurish and unrealistic. Neither can she adequately summon the intense feelings needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; At times, while her daughter is missing, she manages to hear only vaguely annoyed as if she cannot remember where she left her keys. This is an important true story, so it's too bad that the horrible act of the leading actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the casting is talented enough, but they just can't overcome Rohm's tendency to simply put on a particularly thick imitation of a southern feature when actual play is needed.
