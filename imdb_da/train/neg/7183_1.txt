This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They need to modernize it unnecessarily, and some points are actually just sick. The songs rarely go along the story. They seem to be thrown at random. The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've seen, but it's definitely the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic, does not mean that some cheap adjustments are.
