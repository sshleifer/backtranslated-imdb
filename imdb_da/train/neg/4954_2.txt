I was raised to see the original Batman Animated Series and I am an avid Batman graphic novel collector. With a cartoon hero as iconic as Batman, there are some features that cannot be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when it completely changes the character, it is too long. I bought one of the seasons for "The Batman" hoping that an additional bonus feature might shed light on the creators' reasoning to make this show such a cruelty. In an interview about "The Batman", one of the artists or authors (I am unsure) is that "We felt we should not row with Batman, but we could row with the villain." So they continued to make Joker an immature child who was asking for attention, the Penguin in an anime knockoff, Mr. Freeze into a super-driven jewel thief, Poison Ivy in a teenage hippie and countless other shameful actions that make Bob Kane roll over into his grave. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up: I wish I had more hands so I could give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. It squeezes my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses Batman's name. Warner Bros ... consider this! Please!
