I really like this western, fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all of whom are in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as a leading actor and it sounded good. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it wasn't. I found myself looking at my clock just 40 minutes into this, and bored me to death. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying, and James Ellison just didn't look like or "Buffalo Bill." Cooper was also not at his best, and wood also succeeded. It was several years before he beat his prime as an actor. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, his western shots are glossy. Go up the pass and see another oater because most of them were far better than this one.
