Some of the filmmakers who participate in this series have made some really good movies, but they are certainly not so good at this series. Especially the writing. Okay, the first season was something better, but these new episodes they create just stink. I'm a big fan of horror, and in my opinion, most of these episodes are total waste. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typically made Hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, poorly conceived and in some cases flat out ridiculous. Much like Tales from the Crypt is the only good thing this series has offered, great nudity! Second, as this series blows hard. I sometimes get the impression that they hired a bunch of eight-degrees to write the episodes. Maybe they did.
