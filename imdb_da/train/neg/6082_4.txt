Although there are many known "TV" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing extraordinary about the movie itself or any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's 70 Series TV series is "Rat Patrol", a major cast and much more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedies he had made ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter", etc. .). Unfortunately, his earthly resemblance to him, as Sledge is a humorous character, is written to redeem the popularity of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western character. But Eastwood's stuff was not so flat and uninteresting. I assume that "A Man Called Sledge" could be classified as a spaghetti western, although the pacing is too slow to really fit this subgenre. Fans of the slow-paced "Combat" TV series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the movie and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in so trendy slow-mo shots and cross-solutions that draw attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose. <br /> <br /> The reason is the standard "big heist" thing (insert "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge planning to raise a $ 300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that the shipment has been moved by 40 foreigners while on the move, while being stopped in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. The story would make a decent hour of television, but grow old very quickly as a very padded film of its own length. Garner does not allow any of his charms to leak into his characterization, and the film does not generate enough excitement to hold a viewer's interest. <br /> <br /> The case goes down and burns shortly after the heel when the gang enters a constructed and completely illogical card game. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
