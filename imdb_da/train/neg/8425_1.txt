Really a disgusting, scary movie with only a small amount of real humor. The father's character is especially vulgar in the extreme (deliberately so evident) and depicted in the most pathetic, seedy way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this movie terribly disruptive, with absolutely no redeeming features at all. Frankly, I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort to be a sick and gross enemy. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed this movie have the ability I totally lack: the joy of a display of deep depravity and squalor. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves.
