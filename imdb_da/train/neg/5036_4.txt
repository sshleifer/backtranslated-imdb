SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell Fifteen year old poor girl Melissa is new to a desert town and it is not long before people around her start to die. The detective will put together the tracks using his Nancy Drew good girl daughter, played on Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Indians are primary suspects as they seem to disturb the condemned citizens. These events all lead to the disclosure of the murderer on Melissa's sixteenth birthday. <br /> <br /> This below average slasher is not too memorable. It has a made for television feel, without much score beyond the title character's own corny theme song that plays a few times throughout. Lines like "the killer will make us coleslaw." Customize in standard four series screens. Marci calls Melissa a bad name and somehow develops a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how difficult it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This movie would be hard pressed to be made today, where the protagonist is fifteen and the director inserts several free-of-charge close-ups of her. The social commentary on the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I'm also surprised by the rather high rating this movie gets. Both the Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to take advantage of the honorable tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage, but I don't feel able to deliver. But on the bright side, unclear movies like this on DVD release hope that others will follow.
