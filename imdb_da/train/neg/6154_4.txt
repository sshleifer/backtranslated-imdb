Portly nice guy falls for a nice blonde; She likes him too, but not for the reasons you might think. A bit of black comedy by author Pat Proft has very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but it has no sustained influence. It's just a quick throwaway bet, hell of Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B-comedies, the somewhat similar "Eating Raoul" is a better bet. There is definitely an entertaining setup here; Unfortunately, the picture has nowhere to go in its second action. An interesting attempt, but it fails. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
