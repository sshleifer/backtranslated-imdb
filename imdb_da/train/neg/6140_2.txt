This movie is fun. The problem is that it is not a comedy. A classic scene involves Kurt Thomas, who just happens to find a pommel horse in the middle of a village square (which he uses to pummel the evil ones.) Another is the trek in the "Crazies Town". Too bad this movie was not made to be a farce, or it may have got better ratings.
