Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to find reclusive one-time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good. May have been entitled to "Bancroft Talks" as the actor attacks this uncertain comic / dramatic / sentimental material for his duration. Hot-of-cold director Sidney Lumet can't get a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's constant overactive is not at all scaled-down by the filmmaker - he keeps her straight ahead: sweet, misty and ranting. Estelle becomes a feature of this scenario (not that the thinly depleted plot also has much to do). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with little to do but support the star and all are trampled by her hamming. * 1/2 from ****
