What is with Indonesian music films? Never have I seen Indonesian music films like those made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of history and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines. <br /> <br /> This story of love for two children, separated and then reunited after a few years of change, has no particular remarks. It's a simple story plot (but it's pretty focused though) with "meant to be" musical story lines here and there. <br /> <br /> Confusing characters to be rescued by brilliant plays are ignored. The greatest actress can try to live up to the character, but it is the best thing she could do, trying. As for the casting, I do not feel the need to put a Balinese student in that story, and of course it is not the only unnecessary sign. The weird thing is, why would I like to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mangoes ...
