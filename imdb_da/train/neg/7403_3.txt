This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's about as much as you can say about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating, the mood is set to "creepy". And then ... nothing. Well, somethings. Just somethings who obviously don't fit in ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre but not particularly scary critters and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, biker duds? Some bands looked a little too much Gwar. My personal favorite was the head muffler who looks a bit more like a medieval trucker who desperately tries to threaten, while at the same time he looks like he would have preferred to lower himself on an Afghan covered sofa, regret his belt, pop a can cheap beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far scarier truckers. At the truck stops. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Daunting !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more cartoon-like and even less scary. At least on the DVD, the videos give an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they seem to just pop up randomly in places, play some bippy "metal" and make people die a little. With a few great special effects, and it's not really terrible considering the lack of decent writing, there's nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
