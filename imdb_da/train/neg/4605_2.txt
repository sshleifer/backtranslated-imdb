This film is written by Charlie Higson, who has previously made the "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony Car Sales Man). He has also written James Bond books for children. In fact, before this I have seen only Gordon's films based on Lovecraft's stories, and each one of them is marvelous. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is completely "modern", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. It works quite well here, but it's still meaningless and cheap. It often reminds me of the camera man who shakes his DV camera in front of the actors and actresses and tries to make stylish movements in the pictures (hoping something tolerable would come out of it). The casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere that is the result of good direction. I think the protagonist, the "zero" young guy, is quite interesting in his "nervousness". The fat guy is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but isn't him. But pretty soon after the start, the film seems to be something not that interesting: In this case, I mean an endless series of scenes of sadism and disease. There is not much humanity in this movie / story: It's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor either. It's a 1'40 long vomit without any relief in any moment. Anyway, Gordon is one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think of this movie as an experiment and a mistake in it. Everyone has to experience losing sometimes, just to learn and find their way back. This can be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty job.
