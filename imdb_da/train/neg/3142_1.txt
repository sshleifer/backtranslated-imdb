Once there was a director named James. He brought us wonderful, exciting science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the things blockbusters were made of and he seemed to have a great future ahead of him as the beginning of computer-generated special effects landed on the film industry. Terminator 2 showed us a glimpse of what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ... and then it happened ............... ... 1997 ........ countless prizes ..... ..... indecent amounts of money ............ scary burst of advertising ...... ...... maximum profit margin ........ Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I have never (ever) been the one to jump on the band and be too critical for that, I have often taken the opposite attitude from the majority just to get an argument going. The Titanic, however, was a movie, I only took one positive out - the one by Kate Winslett was absolutely beautiful all the time! <br /> <br /> The fast dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the play was more wood than my nosy tree house, pictures that meant to scare were actually comical (man falling off ship and hitting propellers), historically fake (not even getting started because there is too much), it had expensive theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the meaningless love story was so boring, self-absorbing and pathetic that it respected the situation of everyone else (I was happy when he died and was disappointed when she did not. It was clearly apparent from the word that this image was designed to appeal to MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, car jogging, teenage girls (DeCaprio itself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band) who would pull their sex - hungry lovers next to a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to be lucky later! The worst thing was that it didn't stop at that time. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because "it costs so much to produce it must be fantastic" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movie". <br /> <br /> The rugged glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for victims of the fatal evening, on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It seemed to me as if he was asking for forgiveness after making a fortune from inaccurate the circumstances leading to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> But if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of waste, they deserve to be ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood, if that's how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had those kinds of chances in life! It's just up there on my ever worst movie list with other silly, historically fake / human interest tripe like "Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
