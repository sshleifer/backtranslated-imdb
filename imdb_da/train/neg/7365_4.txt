A not bad but not so big hoist movie. Kirk Douglas is a newly released prisoner of jail who, after knocking down an offer from Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem follows. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves persecuted by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really greasy love triangle with Douglas infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace of movement fast and there is at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Although an Italian production most of the film seems to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumbering in a Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a fantastic performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone, and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
