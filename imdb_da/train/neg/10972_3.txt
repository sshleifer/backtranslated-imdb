This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. It was a great wannabee. It wanted to be an edgy, nervous laugh, urban-life affirmative film, but it's more of a camera jerking mess. It is much easier to imitate something other than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in. They always hit, pissed or cried together. Only, there was no substance for what they did. The dialogue between characters is supposed to be hip, revealing, instead it comes out trite, and a scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers out there who really liked this movie so I could be wrong.
