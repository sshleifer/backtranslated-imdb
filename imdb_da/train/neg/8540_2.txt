As another mentioned, it starts with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. Then the main story meets: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) randomly and takes a trip into the mountains. First they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered on, with increasing irritation to the audience, by Gaffari. Once in the mountains they seek shelter and are invited by a friendly old lady who seems too hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, who)? What happens now, I will leave the bold viewer to clear out, because I certainly couldn t. Now I like the Eurohorror, and it would be better if only Artigot (writer and director) had made any attempt on logical storytelling. The Background (Pyrenees?) Make an excellent and exciting place for mysterious and occult appearances. The green tops could easily hide supernatural forces and those who command them. The shooting is great. Just want it all sensible. You can watch this movie at archive.org.
