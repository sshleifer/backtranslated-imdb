I saw changing goals ..twice .... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins doing the same movie .... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with boys ..OK now about the movie .... first of all such little boys and girls do not play as big goals ... 2. football does not play in time outs ... 3. if the game is in the end, the referee gives a little overtime (one minute or more) ... and the finish is so predicted .... I think this movie is bad because of the lack of soccer knowledge .... if it was done by European producers, it would be better .. and also the actors urged is not the choice chosen ... they suffer from lack of authenticity. OK they played some seasons throughout the house, but it doesn't make them big stars .... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what is missing in the Olsen twins
