I will keep it short as a movie like this does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the setting, this movie could have been something special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 or so minutes of the movie, I was really thrilled, did direct a decent job of filmography and excitement , although I don't think he managed to catch true bother of an empty London Underground. Character was a big disappointment. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of shit, and you don't care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I am amused by the homeless and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or two (whether they were sensible to the authors or not). <br /> <br /> The biggest villain is kept in the dark in the first half of the movie, but when he is revealed, I was really disappointed. I won't spoil it, but let's just say that my 10-year-old sister was likely to beat him in a wrestling match. All in all, it is just another mediocre horror movie falling into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark. <br /> <br /> Just to emphasize how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least five hours to finish and kill the biggest villain. Instead of running away.
