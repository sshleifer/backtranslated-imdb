This movie is so aggressive. The protagonist looks like he's 35, and I've seen foamed beans with more balls than this guy. The plots are so predictable, it is not even worth looking at for the humor factor. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the worst dialogues I've heard in 3 years, "Let's find a little animal to torture". <br /> Ugh ..... I can't even continue, not see this pile of garbage it was made in 8 days. The one highlight is the full guy calling the protagonist a bassoon for drawing pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, uatches
