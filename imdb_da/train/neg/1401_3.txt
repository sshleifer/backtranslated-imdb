Someone mentioned editing. This has been edited poorly and what started as something exciting became an incomprehensible mess. First, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experimentation they are involved in? And what exactly do they test? Apparently, there are some great plans that an agency will use. The action is pretty bad. Everyone is emotional. Everyone keeps secrets. They often mention that if it wasn't for the money, they would hang it up. There is a fake minister spitting the scripture. Wood and wood. But again, the biggest hang-up is the lack of room for the actors. There are some really cheesy items. These small rooms and the chaise lounges. The horrible wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting but didn't seem to go anywhere.
