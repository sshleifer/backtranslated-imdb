A particularly vicious example of Italian cult cinema with a nonsense title to start (if anything, or alternatively Satan's Mark is even less relevant to the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of Erotica) Constructing a Flat kind of atmosphere throughout ?? actually matched with handling which is downright awful! Here we get the usual group of people (an actor) stranded on an island (as they were invited by a Count? Since he had been enchanted by the leading lady, a death ring for his missing spouse)! The characters are pretty much stereotyped: Middle-aged but dashing hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history carries more than his share of violent tragedy), killing heroine, final companion (reminiscent of Mae West and evoking the most annoying of the a lot!), an insane but devoted stage leader (forever chided by one and the other for his cumbersome behavior!), a few lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi, who once comes into action if you know what I mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi, for what it's worth, it's really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressive maid, and so on. While the movie is no mean unwatchable, the terrible copying, the snail's pace, scary production (with scenes depicting the furious sea lifted from a black and white movie!) And the fact that the murders only occur within the final half hour , does not help. In addition, Marcello Giombini's score, although comfortable in itself, comes as unnoticed modern in the circumstances; That said, the revelation shows a surprisingly comprehensive one (considering there is no shortage of suspects here).
