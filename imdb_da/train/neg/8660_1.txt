This is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal films I've ever seen. It follows the typical premise for a lab experiment gone wrong, and a giant crocodile with a fast growth chemical in it escapes. The monster looks very much like a dinosaur that has large Tyranosaurous-like hind legs when it just looks like an upper hook crocodile. Everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes "cliche", minute by minute. Why are there always two drunken redneck hunters looking for darkness that separates? Plus, there is always a guy and a girl who share a lame and blatant love while in life-threatening situations. Too much has already been said by me and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing this ...
