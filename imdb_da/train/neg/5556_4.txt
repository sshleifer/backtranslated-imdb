Within the first 17 minutes of director Bradford Mays "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" we have already been subjected to a stupid recap and accompanying voice-over on the first two movies, hilarious over-acting, about three minutes of recordings simply torn off the second movie and slightly edited to appear as new footage, and a long ad sees the spiked and tormented title character of Universal Theme Parks-Universal, the company that distributed this movie. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is quite handy when it comes to cheap cash-ins on the success of a previous movie. <br /> <br /> This time, the disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake (aka, "Darkman", portrayed by "Mummy" actor Arnold Vosloo) locks horns with evil brother-in-law and miserable man Peter Rooker (played in a brilliant super-top performance by Jeff Fahey) and over 87 minute films grows to develop a love for smoking wife and daughter, once again learning to look after another person. <br /> <br /> Blah. Blah. Blah. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty much a silly way for the studio to make more money out of Sam Raimi's original movie, which I consider a great action thrill movie. <br /> <and there are also a number of stupid subplots, including a villain that apparently was one of the original doctors to save Darkman after his scarring, and she seduces our hero to believe she is an ally, Before she reveals her jailed plot to help Rooker create more super-human drives like Darkman. Apparently, she can't just do the same procedure on the bullies she performed at Darkman. Why? I can't really explain it because the movie certainly isn't. <br /> <br /> There is also a crawler pad that involves a District Attourney who threatens to bring down Rooker's organization and some other very silly things are going on. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't really matter. This movie feels like two or three episodes of a TV show edited together more than a real movie. The direction changes between pretty good and downright dull (a scene where Darkman rides his train-like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher is simply stupid), and editing is a mixed bag. The movie is moving too fast for someone to really care about what's happening. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this movie and the whole series are all the time ... I dunno ... Another 15 minute mixed bag recordings. In fact, commenting, one of my favorite things in this movie, looks at recordings that have been reused from the previous movies and then looks for footage in this movie that is repeated several times. Yes, it's cheap. It's a thing to do a cover at the beginning of the movie, and maybe repeat a shot or two, but in the large volume they do it (minutes of recordings repeated from previous movies), it's just sloppy and amateurish. <Br /> <br /> I also have to say that Darkman's psychedelic montage freaks are a bit overdone in this movie. They are so stylized and overdone that they work, but only in light doses and in the proper context, as Raimi did in the original film. Here there are at least four or five, and they feel very sudden and out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie is not without good points. A few action scenes are well done. The Clich√© story of Darkman longing for a real life works appropriately for a direct-to-DVD feature. Some of the actors are nice, especially from Rooker's wife, portrayed by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. Also, while no Danny Elfman composes, Randy Miller composes some fine music based on Elfman's original themes. But in general, the movie is too fast, cheap and silly to be taken seriously. Alternatively, Arnold Vosloo seems boring and bubbly from stage to stage, and Fahey, while a joy to see as an over-the-top villain, just doesn't fit right into the series. <br /> <br /> Like "Darkman II", I would recommend this to fans of the original, who will surely be laughing. Otherwise, you do not need to apply. A four out of ten.
