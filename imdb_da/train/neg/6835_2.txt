I can't see how anyone who even likes Van Damne liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts with some promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are excellent. The action scenes with the family department trying to save the twins is a good start and is well led into the main story. However, the film is completely down the hill from there. <br /> <br /> It would have been good if the director could have stayed with the original premise. It is that the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. A brother should be skilled in martial arts, but the other brother should be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time comes, that the brother who has never picked a gun before is a big marker, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts suddenly makes divisions and high kicks. <br /> <br /> The reason, action, etc. is simply ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne confronts an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne, he makes a war of war, as if carrying a battle ax and running on him. Van Damne continues to pick up a gun from a fallen soldier and shoot him while still about 75 to 80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing conclusions. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. But instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo throws barrels on Van Damne as Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating films that had so much promise. If you are a Van Damne fan, save your time and watch Hard Target or one of his previous movies.
