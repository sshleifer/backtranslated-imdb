This was a horrible movie. There was no history line at all. To top it off, as they couldn't explain the blood and do (the only good part) ... they threw a few foreigners! I hate when executives (or anything) run out of ideas and then blame foreigners! Watch this movie if you want. But don't say I didn't warn you. Two things: How could Vinny say "welcome" when he didn't have a tongue? It's a shame, Mr Jones didn't have a bigger role. Second, who bugged me, why were we shown Vinny Jones' boils and he cut them off and put them in blue liquid, so these have no further role. Why not? I don't like being shown anything and it has nothing to do with the story line at all. Shortly said. Bad story. I wouldn't waste my time - wish I'd seen Mirrors instead.
