What seemed like a good prerequisite for a movie ... unfortunately it has to deliver at almost every level. Very hard to follow at the start of the movie, I actually found myself struggling for the urge to turn off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is that the camera's work is simply over the top with so many "arty" splits and semi- subliminal cuts throughout the film that actually distract you from the overall story. It really tries too hard to immerse you at the moment and build for an exciting ending, but the movie has just as many half-thought characters and not relevant script, it just makes you feel disappointed and confused about why they were trying to go so deeply it.
