Superhero film almost always sucks and that is no exception. Its only redeeming quality is the fact that the film could have been even worse. I'd put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' over this movie so yes it's so bad ... If you're looking for a black superhero, check out 'Blankman' it's not a "serious" superhero movie but at least its entertaining.
