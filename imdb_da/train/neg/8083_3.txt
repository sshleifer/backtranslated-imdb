Disowned by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster struck Japanese theaters before coming to the states and immediately went to video where it was not seen again before the Turner network needed anything other than infomercials to fill their 3 am 6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin. The Smithee name should be used when the studio cheats the film so badly that the director will no longer have its name attached to it. But I'm afraid that sarafias cannot blame the study entirely on this. The actors, mostly graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver a cornball line after another. The reason is the same. The special effects are unimpressive. The parts that are not ridiculous are simply boring. The script or book must have been good - why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston agree to appear in this dud? But something went wrong wrong from the side to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad - it's good.
