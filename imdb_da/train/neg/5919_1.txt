I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little Laura Ingalls to get involved in something so badly produced. I'm not sure if it was terrible to write or poorly control or both, but it leaves a viewer very disappointed to have wasted time watching this swill. It consisted of a weak naive story line, very bad lines, and proudly solely on beautiful scenes and beautiful people selling it. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. You would be better off renting a tape full of static than wasting your time on this crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a beautiful pathetic part as a ranchist who seems to be working very hard to do nothing. Anyone who has ever been close to a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles and not a person with great knowledge of the world.
