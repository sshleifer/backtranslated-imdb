I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are looking at this waste? OK my dad and mom love it lol, but I make sure I'm out of the room well before it comes. It's so depressing and boring, but the worst thing about it is to act, I can't keep all detective programs like this because detectives are so wood and heartless. What happened to detective programs with true mystery ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictitious characters, we know nothing about what died over 20 years ago ??? I wish bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the dicus priest who's finished, there's more room for crap like this.
