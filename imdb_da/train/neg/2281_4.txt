Think "scene play". This is worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. COmpare Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas of this movie. Is there a vampire in the solution in this "Bavarian village", or is there a more natural, albeit equally creepy explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, which is cast as a special moronic character. It is fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a character. Not much is happening for a long time, but then we find that Atwill's pipe backrest is the real killer. There is too much "comic relief", but it is par for the course of this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
