I started watching this movie with low expectations, I actually only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel (a novel I never read). <br /> <br /> I'm happy that my expectations were low because the movie was nothing close to good, but it managed to keep you interested. What really pulls this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is long, has no "fine" pictures and no scary, the dialogues are stupid and the special effects are crap. The only good thing is that it keeps you as I said interested (I think the book should be good) without using very horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
