So far it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I watched this movie on my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that coverage would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The film was filmed and boring. At one point there is a minute's scene without talking, just a car that drives to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, incredible dialogue and basically no plot to talk about. If you rent this movie then watch it with some friends and it can make a good comedy. Otherwise, run when you watch this movie.
