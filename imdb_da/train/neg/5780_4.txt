I really wanted to like this movie and looked all the way through and thought it would be better. Don't make me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever, but it never lives up to that potential. The prerequisite is good, the throw is fantastic (I was specially pumped to witness David Naughton's return) and God loves them, you can tell everyone that they have tried their best. It just falls short again and again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest movies and despite the fact that it looks easy, you should probably just forget to try to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are amazing in this and they need to be seen more often ... they are the reason why it will be 4 stars from me. If you want "Spinal Tap" of horror, I suppose you might want the guy who made "Spinal Tap" for the helm there ... just thinking high there.
