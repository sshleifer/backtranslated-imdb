Based on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited another couple to this movie. I really wondered - all 4 of us hated it and used to watch our watches and wait for the movie to end. Half of the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes in Paris - for example, I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I couldn't really recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, don't miss this. If you're down to earth like me, you'll be sorry you saw it.
