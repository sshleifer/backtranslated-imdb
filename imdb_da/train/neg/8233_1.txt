This was probably the worst movie ever serious. I could actually do better myself, it wasn't even set up properly. It's like this movie had a $ 5 budget and left with change. Don't look at it. I didn't even get through this movie all the way, had to turn it off. I've given this a 1/10 because it was fun how the producer of this movie wanted to be a horror movie, but actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of that car went after them. The little I saw was a woman with a gun telling a lot of girls to take off all their clothes, what the hell? It should also be a kind of cheesy porn movie.
