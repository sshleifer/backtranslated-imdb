Nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense, huffing and puffing with a "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (kykoo comes in mind), but many have bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a "dozor" type of emptiness. Acting would be terrible, if not for the saving grace of utterly unpleasant direction and incompetent editing, which is sometimes so terrible that it derives from the actors' impotence. Particularly appreciated by the cameraman to make sure every shot is shaken (would anyone realize that Blair Witch has had his 15-second undeserved fame?) And takes aim at attention deficit that is entertaining on CounterStrike and masturbation. The female management poses and tries to look seductive for often, male antihero needs a diction coach (though genetics are not bad: rather expressive eyes.) A (middle) finger to this irrelevant pile of non-art. Anyone who judges this positively better is a (distant) cousin of "auteurs".
