Follows the usual formula by adding a new recruitment - this time the first African-American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman disintegrates armed forces - through the US Navy's deep-sea dive training program run by a racist avid (Robert DeNiro). If the program wasn't bad enough, it should be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a strict father as a poor black cushion in the south, is the expected paragon of justice. The girls - you could hardly call them women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have lesser roles and are most in favor of arguing that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent artists - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more perfunctory roles. <br /> <br /> It's about it. Almost everything else could have been collected by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro welcomes indoors, uncovered. After a brutal attack on hospital staff, he is transferred from his outfit rather than being busted. Someone shouts "I'm out here" in the early 1950s. (Maybe it was a common term at that time. If so, "my bad.") People address each other by rank - "Lieutenant", "Boatswain's Mate", "Commander" as they do in the army, while in Navy they are simple "Mister" (if an officer) or addressed by their last name (if enlisted). I did not disturb whether there was a rank called "Senior Chief Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a hard line for raising. Everyone in Navy seems to hate Negro except a Wisconsin guy. He stiffens and is despised by the others in his class. It's like the scene in "Animal House" where the applicant for a tony brotherhood is asked to wait for a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is an enlisted man, a second-class officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from high school. In one of their arguments, she cares for him. She just wants to be a doctor, and he must join her, quit the fleet, and lead a quiet life. "And just let life pass you by?" Retager said. Yes. Yes, just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by. You can wave to it from the golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> These kind of flicks were common enough in World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner", that kind of thing. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You've learned something about becoming a bombardment or a gunner. Here are the technical details skipped, perhaps because the author didn't know anything about them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in high school). I couldn't follow what happened during some of the emergencies without which such a movie would not exist. If I got the mechanical problems right, it was because I guessed right. The direction is also no help. The film is abundant in close up, so many that they lose any dramatic impact they may have had. And the emergencies are confusing because they are sick focused. Why continue? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost anyone will do - except perhaps "G. I. Jane" where the abused hero is a heroin. Try the training camp scene in "The Young Lions." There is the victim a Jew. Or try "From Here to Eternity", where no simple sympathy buttons are printed, and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict, like "Cool Hand Luke." No easy excuses are offered because simple excuses are too easy. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly formal and not well done.
