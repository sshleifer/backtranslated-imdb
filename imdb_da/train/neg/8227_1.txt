I keep it fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a "short cut" that leads them down a deserted forest road. Of course, there is nothing but good things and they come safely to their destination. <br /> <br /> Okay, they don't. Soon they will be chased by a horrible chick that has some serious psychological problems and what follows is a 90-minute sorry. <br /> <br /> I never hope to see any of these actors in any movie ever again. Their screaming, appalling voices gave me headaches, and the manuscript was so poorly written that it included a lot of repetitions and indecently hysterical screaming. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
