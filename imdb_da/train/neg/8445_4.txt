For me, each art form is judged by these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: good shots and sometimes interesting plays. The long close-ups indicate a function that the viewer can fill by itself. Due to missing texts, the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests having depth, but sometimes it turns out that he has nothing to say. This movie seems like an introverted person. If you haven't read synopsis, you can't see that it was the suicide (and the unanswered question why?), That changes Anna's view of life and makes her suspicious. Why don't you talk to me? asks Sebastiaan. Anna does not answer, she only begins to look at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of this shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What should this movie say? What is meant by this movie? The answer for me: It shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their life is simple and boring. Motives behind their actions are not displayed. The rest are: skins, homes, landscapes. Well done and artistically done, but meaningless without the need for "instructions for use". In my opinion, this film is made for other artists, not for the common viewer.
