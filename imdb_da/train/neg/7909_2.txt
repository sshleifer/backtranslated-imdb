Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 7 out of 10f 10. This should be one of the worst movies I've seen this year. Not only was the action incredibly bad, the story (if you can call it) was just as bad. Offcourse everyone knows what will happen within the first 5 minutes. It's not a bad thing if you can catch the audience during that moment. However, this is not the case. There is no action, no excitement, not even a spark between the two leading actors. Unfortunately, it was a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and 2 of just to try
