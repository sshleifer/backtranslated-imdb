- A Mexican pastor becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and I thought it might be fun . It wasn't. It's scary to see. Embarrassing. Any possibility of comedy is mercilessly wasted. <br /> <br /> I admit I don't like Jack Black anyway. Then I have raised my brain to think of a good role he has done. All I can do is where he was, and so on. was like a necessary foil for the John Cusack character in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of the terribly relentless flattened ham-it-up knockabout guys (like the little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who have to tell being indulgent idiotic, not the same as being fun. <br /> <br /> It's not even slapstick. It's just annoying. It's not even stupid, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I've also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if there's anything to go by, I won't rush to find it on DVD.
