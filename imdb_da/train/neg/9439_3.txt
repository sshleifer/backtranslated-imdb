Twist endings can be really cool in a movie. It is particularly interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we are just paying attention. These types of twist endings are the one that makes people think. Then we have phrases that this movie has. Twists that, whether you are aware, you have no idea what will happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist rather than shock, it is a somewhat dumbfounded reaction. This movie starts as if it will be interesting to take on horror, but after approx. 20 minutes is nothing but dull dialogue and a stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert so they love to travel through the woods and hit a tree trunk. They end up with some old, cruel lady who hates men, and they are greeted by her domestic daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange outcomes happen as these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to leave or come home, and the excitement progresses in a stupid slasher. <br /> <br /> This movie is too trapped in its dialogue and it is always between only a few characters. We have the three biggest girls, the spooky spiders and the old lady, and conversation of any significance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It is actually quite madman sitting through their conversations. We want to know what is happening, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing). Plot holes are abundant here. The house that these girls keep on coming in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! A two hour or less trip will kill them. Why didn't they take a trip with the worker for this household who drove into town? Did he have a seat? How do these girls never question leaving and just being willing to stay, rarely even check each other? Why should this have so many stupid words? Maybe the answers are in the boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a five-character slasher film is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the end is definitely out there, but undoubtedly stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 min. R for nudity and violence.
