Maybe because I was so young, innocent, and BRAINWASH, when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me now. But I would say it left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. It served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly afraid of what the newly converted post-rapture Christians had to endure when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I will not spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention details in the scenes, but I can still see them in my head ... and it has been 19 years.
