During the cheap filming in the video beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is thoughtlessly simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released to a halfway house due to overfill of the hospital. She is by far the most sensual resident, while a man puts dead flies in someone else's soup. Ethel is then plagued by one of the half-housekeepers with a chocolate bar after he has cut down on the cost savings to feed the residents dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a cord on the stairs and then .... well, you get the idea. If it all sounds like fun, it's not. This movie was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse plays. The characters are then wood when they deliver their lines that they must stand out in front of a cigar shop. To make matters worse, half of the movie consists of flashbacks for the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is a little better. A very poor effort.
