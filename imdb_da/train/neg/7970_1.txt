Whether you want to spend almost 2 hours in your life, it looks like you like your horror movies. If you like them then God awful, they are hysterical, look away. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in my life (and I've seen 'Long Time Dead') and I say it as a fan of the low budget horror / gore genre and have seen a good couple comparing it to. I don't even go into the details of what makes this movie bad as it is, the only good thing about it is, it's so awful it's one of the funniest things I've seen this year. If you can find this to rent cheaply it is definitely worth seeing if you were involved in doing it - shame on you. : o) IMDb should introduce a 0/10 rating specifically for this movie, it deserves it thoroughly.
