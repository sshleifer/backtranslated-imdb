I tried to finish this movie three times, but it is God terrible. Case in point: mother and daughter run up to bed and breakfast, mother stops for gas, crazy gas station daring mad at her hubby, if running B&B tries to rape her. She escapes, leads to the B&B and instead of her hubby going ballistic and she wants to call the police, the story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other action logic deficits abound. The action is also lukewarm, and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a truly corny, ill-acted moment. Instant intense gore / dead unweighted interwoven with lukewarm scenes of timely interplay of characters. <br /> Less focus on doing, more focus on mood and history would have been appreciated.
