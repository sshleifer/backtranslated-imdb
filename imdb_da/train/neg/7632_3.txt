Many people see this as a classic, but of course I must have missed something. Life in the Anarene, Texas in the early 50s is pretty boring - which means that a movie about life in the Anar, Texas in the early 50s will also be pretty boring! What is it that so many people see in this? When the last picture show in Anarene closes, there really will be nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes the point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes, there is not much to do, so basically it's about sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally boring adults in town. You see, there isn't much for them to do either - except having sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with bored teenagers) or gnawing at the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought would add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens because of it, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elop, but nothing really happens because of it, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnapped a little girl but nothing really happens because of it. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie finally came with Billy's death (Sam Bottoms), who really points out the life of emptiness in this pathetic little town that men stand around looking at the body's debate where to go for breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, supposedly I suppose to point out how gray this city is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like the Bund, shepherd , bridges and Randy Quaid. (As a side, it was scary to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looked like his character of cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I do not think! 3.10
