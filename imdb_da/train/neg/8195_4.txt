Every Christmas Eve I get my kids to endure yet another view of it is a wonderful life. I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa. So sue me. I admit it. I like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. I also like good, intelligent ones, but as with so many things, black is a good thing. What would the Christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching queue of Santa in all his guises, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will let no one forget Bedford Falls, but I don't think a Christmas movie should reach iconic stature to succeed. "Peace" is an OK movie, with enough humor for the adults and enough charm for the children. My wife and I laughed a lot, though most of the humor was obvious, and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top-notch Santa who helped a lot. Not a good flip, and it's unlikely to look at everyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a little touch of spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
