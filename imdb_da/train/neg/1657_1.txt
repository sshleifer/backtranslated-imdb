This movie was worth five beats on my "hurter card". I saw this while stationed in Virginia in the mid-70s. I saw it alone, so I wasn't distracted while I saw it. It sucked. It was the most ridiculous, total waste of celluloid I've ever seen. I know others who have reviewed this movie have thought it was amazing. I offer you this: If it was so great, what was it at the ticket office? End of discussion.
