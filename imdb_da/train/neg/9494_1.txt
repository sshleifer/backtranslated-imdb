The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was led by Clint Eastwood whose work I admire immensely. The wires had absolutely no chemistry. Not a second I could believe that there was something deeper than desire between them. The story didn't ring right. Add to the stylish conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere and you've got yourself a real stink. Kay Lenz's naked scenes can be worthwhile for those seeking some sweet fare, but otherwise it's a huge waste of time. My thoughts as I saw the movie were that it would have been better termed "Cheesy."
