"Black Angel" is less whodunit, with June Vincent as a woman trying to rescue her husband from the electric chair after being found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has a solvable role as a suspect. This movie noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer who never gets anything special. It is pleasant enough, but at one point it stops sensibly, and the solution to the mystery evokes one of the great "give me a break" reaction. What ended up alone could have sunk the movie completely, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was never really good at playing good guys. I love movies noirs, but this one was a real disappointment.
