Although I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its terrible production values), it looks like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and horrible sign created for children (including Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm). If bright idea was to create a kind of short mutant dog and make it possible to speak and then saddle Scooby-Doo characters with it?! The one who deserves to die or see this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grunts on the nerves - and that's only in the BETTER episodes !! After many years it would have been better to just finish the franchise than create that mess! I can see why in the live action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain-Doo - since almost everyone hates him!
