"It must be you" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer who became an author. When Charlie's fiance goes out of town, he's stuck with the entire wedding planning. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to be married too. The two quickly become friends and plan to plan their separate weddings together. This is when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna, and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge provide truly mediocre performances that make this movie even more intense.
