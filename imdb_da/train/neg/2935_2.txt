(Rated 21 by The Film Snob.) (See our blog, what-to-see-next for details on our rating system.) <br /> <br /> Here's a movie that makes you piss on your own face in an attempt to earn release from on-screen tedium. <br /> <br /> You won't twist your hands or roll your eyes or suck in your popcorn. No Yes. For a movie of * this * averagousity, only clawing on your own face will do. <br /> <br /> When you start to scratch your own face - as you begin! - start in the lower part. You need your upper part with his handy tears, intact to the right Tear-jerking third act that can bring you to your knees if you haven't complained your way out of the whole theater then. <br /> <br /> In a season, Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms celebrate as the new gold standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, permaybe a movie, this tedium will be welcomed as a thing that everyone could create. * Watching * However, it is a far more dangerous business. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth tier celebrity / entertainment magazine, is about to see his magazine go under. He needs a miracle and what he gets is a phone call from New York City, in the United States. <br /> <br /> The publisher of Sharps magazine Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says "Come work for me!" With his own employees who perform the fax machine out of his apartment / office in the background, say "Yes", is a no-brainer. Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing allllllll the wrong thing. His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are (1) Jewish and (2) homosexuals. <br /> <br /> He kills the dog dog for Sohpie Maes, the industry's hottest movie star when she leaves it in the magazine's offices during a business luncheon. <br /> <br /> This is a patch of bad luck for everyone, for example. Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes before waking up to the Dunst character. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, he alienates Alison Olsen's scripting-confusion by Kristen Dunst, a colleague assigned him to show him magazines of the magazine * and * The Big Apple. (We have, of course, been in a movie before, and then we know how this relationship will end. That's why we need intact tear channels for the movie's third act.) <br /> <br /> The problem with The Thing is, the manuscript just never jells, except for the one tears-channel set piece in which True Love rules. <br /> <br /> Publisher Harding must be a son of a bitch who also wants to throw the whole job over. The manuscript never gets stuck on either side of this dichotomy, but Bridges is left to twist and wiggle in the breeze. Alison Olsen must despise Sidney Young, but when he comes up to her (as he does constantly) she makes a point of engaging him in conversation, instead of trying to deter his existence. "Comedy" of early scenes is built around a pig that destroys an expensive hotel room, and then take the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception. The hot starlet Maes admits that she is attracted to Young because he is "hurt". "The character never shows us * why * he is hurt, though. This is another consequence of the movie's mortally wounded script. <br /> <br /> In an hour and fifty minutes, this thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, it is uninspiring, unfunny, unstoppable and not even profitable.
