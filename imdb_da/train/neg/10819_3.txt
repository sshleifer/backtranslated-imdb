I agree with one of the other commentators on good story and good actors, but mismatched, and I will also say hasty. It has been around 24 years since I read the book as it was in school. But I felt that you should know the story of Jane Eyre when you look at this as the pieces are omitted and therefore it does not make sense. For example, Jane & Mr Rochester have barely spoken and suddenly he suggests marriage !!! The actors do not have time to let the audience know how their character feels about every thing that happens in history. The actors are good but do not get enough time to do this story justice. I'm sorry to say that, but I didn't really like this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be Jane Eyre's movie of my preference, but you should check out 1983's BBC mini-series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles. I love it so much, I see it regularly. There is a shortened version that goes to 225mins or the full version for 330mins.
