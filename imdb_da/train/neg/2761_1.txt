Everyone does things that they later regret. Things they want they can blame on drugs or foreign possessions. Things that themselves seem to be rational at that time later appear to be engraved invitations to suffering and endless discrimination of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people, it signs the note for the new lobster, for others pick it up for a homicidal hitchhiker, for others are sending their bank account information to third millionaires mysteriously attached to cash. <br /> <br /> For me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars In retrospect, I should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly reused this movie would turn out to be from its backbone and repetitive title. But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact, and a naive belief originating from the booming poster in the lobby, I really wanted this movie to work. Unfortunately, when the old man in the farmhouse explained the entire backstory, fifteen minutes into the picture, I had the sudden descending revelation that comes from knowing each plot of a still invisible movie. And worse: I knew just as badly that all points would suck. <br /> <br /> Let me be quite clear here, the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth within the ultimate evil to properly describe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> As for knowing all the twists of movies, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales are not worthy to fill, it conveniently spread extra subspots each time the protagonists were threatened by the ghost of the meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was infected with dense calls, miraculous escapes and concentrated instances of poorly explained anxiety. <br /> <br /> This movie is what would happen if you gave the production of Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And lots of spirits. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you could grab all the coolest looking sets from successful action movies from the last decade: First, take the rasta-talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac, until they are ready to club Navy Seals. Next, take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (you can even call him Ethan as a "subtle" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) And give them lots of movie noir narration so nobody gets confused while trying to follow their thought pool depths. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a raspy-voiced villain in a piggy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yards and a couple of giant cobra's angry to have their scenes deleted from the latest version of King Kong and Put them all out in a specific order in modern day Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now go to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return, mix these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved in a homogenized mass of cheese and serve half gelatin. <br /> <br /> On several points in this picture I found myself loud and saying "Make the bad movie stop," and break into tears. <br /> <br /> To call this, a B movie would give it an undeserved campaign. After the summer school and a lot of physical therapy, it may pass a C-level movie if you can somehow sleep most of the time. <br /> In short, if you ever find yourself having money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for hideous, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars can just be the movie for you.
