Yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and apprentice, this show is pretty bad. I didn't mind the first few shows, but then realized how pathetic everyone was supposed to go to the show in the first place. The antics of Alex and Aaron gave men a bad name in the way they cheated on or dumped their choices at the first opportunity it really wasn't a good look to the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on TV, and she was definitely not the smartest girl around (very media-wise, but I doubt there is much more there). <br /> <br /> I haven't really seen any of the shows since, except for the occastional re-run on daytime television. I think reality TV is treating it as "entertaining garbage bin". See it as something you can laugh at and you don't have to think too much about (I don't see CSI as its reality TV tired and clichéd, but you have to think too much anyway while you look). <Br /> <br /> A few thoughts on some reasons for going to the show. At first, the woman "tells everyone" Woman like Amy (who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy, and it didn't happen to her. Hi Amy, how about joining a club? Getting a hobby? To do charity work? Change your job to one where you meet more guys? Gees, all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting "the perfect man". Clue to ladies: he does not exist. However, there are many good guys out there who would make good men, some might be right for you! they must not earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior look alike, but they are big guys all the same. The woman's groundlessness on this show is absolutely incredible. I am still a young man who was led to believe that the woman gradually grew out of their superficiality as they grew older and more realistic about their future partner. This show shows otherwise. <br /> All in all, this show shows a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman sees men in society. It's really a terrible show and I think all these types of shows should just stop being made. The best dating shows of a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. Nothing is more manned between the "couples" than a simple evening. Bachelor unfortunately takes too much.
