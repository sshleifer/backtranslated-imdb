In a distant galaxy is a planet called Ceta. It's native people worshiping cats. But the dog's people are waging these cat-loving people, and they have no choice but to go to earth and paint people for food. This is one of the stupid f # @ kni ng ideas for a movie I've seen. Let Ted Mikels make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he put in previous films. It's like he enjoys playing in a celluloid game Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are the United States viewer. Mr. Mikels and his stupid little handbag actually have people who still buy this crap. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment from Ted Mikels; The story behind the making (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind scenes footage; Ted Michael's filmography; and trailers for "The Worm Eaters" "Girl in Gold Boots", "Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (featuring nudity), "Blood Orgy of the She Devils" and "The Corpse Grinders"
