Virgin is selected to marry a rich guy. Rich guy is urinating. Woman on boat likes sailor. Sailor urinates. Virgin participates in widespread municipal dinner. The man is urinating on the dining table. Boat women are fighting for small boys. The man pretends to be baby urinating. There is an underlying theme here. Makavejev is trying to say that he is pi $$ ed off on the world. To say this is a bizarre movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene where Laure, who hardly speaks ten lines of the whole movie, baths in chocolate syrup. It's really a cute scene, but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in the mouth, unless one happens to share the director's fetishes.
