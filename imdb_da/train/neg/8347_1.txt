The title should have been "The Walker". Only he went. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the movie that was good. The description of the film does not really comply with the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a deadly person. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry to use my money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I kept hoping it would be better .... what a mistake. I'm getting worse. <br /> <br /> If there is a suggestion I can make to the producer, he is redirecting his life to another field because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea.
