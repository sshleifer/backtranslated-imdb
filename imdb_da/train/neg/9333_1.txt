Terrible!!! I won't be too negative, but this movie has an IQ of silly monkey. What a disaster. I just couldn't believe how bad this movie is. The dialogues are just very strange and without a subject, the camera sometimes works just awful, the music sometimes as a soundtrack to Lawrence of Arabia, I just looked at this movie to see how much worse it can get. Some of the sidebar "actors" are total disaster. Scrap but all my thumbs and toes and something that can hang down on my body fall to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who may know that he is in financial crisis to participate in such a fiasco movie. . . . . this film should have been presented to all students in all film schools just to teach them a lesson on how not to make a movie
