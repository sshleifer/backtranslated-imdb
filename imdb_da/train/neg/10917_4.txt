I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode lacked much. The original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed in advance, even years before the modern detective shows today. But it was fun to see the crazy sofa designs and "modern" electronics equipment and of course the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun on modern art for sale. The high-tech home is a Jetsons or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and it's fun to think of writers who discover these "out-of-the-way gizmos". <br /> <br /> If it is sunny outside, play as there are much better Columbo episodes. Still, we must be grateful for cable television that these episodes are broadcast.
