Why did I waste my time with this movie? There wasn't a single joke or line all the way through. Slapstick wasn't even fun. I really mean an uncontrolled vacuum cleaner? Why has National Lampoon's name been linked to this movie? Even Christmas holiday was better than this (I actually thought the movie was a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> DON'T AVOID AS THE PLAY!
