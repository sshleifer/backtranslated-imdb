I was on the phone when I could not see this one when it was screened at Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that it was going to be cable tonight, I set it in memory as soon as I could . So was it worth the wait? Well, let's backtrack a bit as I haven't yet given you the plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his way of life is. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray completely pounded, Sean asks off the guy that they had Sean follow around. And it goes from there. Which brings me back to the question asked. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the structure was pretty good, and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it is not far as fierce as I was led to believe and somewhere along the movie's running time, the ball not only fell but fumbled and taken in the other direction. I know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without destroying the movie. But it was needless to say it happened. The end does not save the film either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My character: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her take on a fantasy and then in the next more ta-tas and it pans down and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
