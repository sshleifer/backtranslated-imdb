I watched this movie back when it premiered. <br /> <br /> It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with printed messages with another, simply helping them and managing their hands. <br /> So suddenly these children were, many of whom did not even adhere to the keyboard or screen when the messages were printed (they could look up in the ceiling in some cases), but their moderators were sticky on the keyboard, began to write abuse abuse from their parents and other people, send parents and child protection agencies in a proberbial tizzy, left and right. <br /> <br /> It all turned out to be a mistake when a third person presented a folder, opened it for the child and said 'write the picture you see' so that as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator, a fold would fall down and reveal another image. So while children may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time, every time the flower was written, the name of the picture was written, what the moderator had observed, never what the baby was showing. <br /> <br /> So who is writing? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This movie took another catastrophic trip as the Australian poster said the person who smuggled the child into the movie was in the situation trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> Had Melissa Gilbert never put his son in that place, he wouldn't have been melted, that's what the movie says. He was better off under his supervision. <br /> <br /> If I turn my child over to your organization for help and he gets bullied instead, do you think I'll be eager to listen to everything you need for it? Not likely! I think it's a sure bet that all these accused messages that these children were writing out that this movie was based, they never accused anyone within their operation that took place here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remember that the movie provided a very good performance by Gilbert as a mother of an autistic, but apart from that, the film didn't really do much. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was that the baby wrote at the end of Patty Duke, and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he wrote. . . . . "we won!" This child was infected. If you cut off my leg and I'll take you to court, and you're found guilty of harming me, attacks, whatever, it's legal justice, but it doesn't take my leg back. <br /> <br /> In my state, I would like to see it as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> What chance this child has for what is perceived as normality with autism alone is further damaged by violence. <br /> <It is superficial to think that you have to look at every situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty of court. <br /> <br /> Just a poor handling of a situation and circumstances all around here.
