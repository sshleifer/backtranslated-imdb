This movie has beautiful scenes. Unfortunately, it has no reason. To get a plot there must be a conflict. This movie had none. It spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and never put any activity into it. The image tries to be artistic, but fails to pay attention to the founders of the narrative story. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing, find something in this movie, just don't expect a story. There is not one.
