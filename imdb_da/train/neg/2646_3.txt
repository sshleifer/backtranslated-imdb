When someone enters a movie of this type of movie, it is not quite clear that an overdose of the great over-the-counter brain medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, comes in very handy. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman whom Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but who is also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw this was a dumb gasp of "Hunh?" Where have I seen this before? It turns out I've seen it before, but in a movie made much later than this one. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a forgettable pile of dragon made in 1987, deposited on the ethereal beauty of an Emmanuelle Beart, who had no talking lines, also wearing a blonde pearl and making life hell to soap actor Michael Knight. Much worse at all possible angles with ultra-low 80s values, but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey. In any case, not to draft, this is not a memorable movie and stands as a doorstep for information because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy, neither very good actors but great singers, would be together to play on "innocence" and "cut" romance, as they were known for. Then you might have a cold shower, not because there are some steaming scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.
