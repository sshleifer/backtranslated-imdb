I don't understand the positive comments about this movie. It's cheap and uncomfortable at all levels, and I can't understand how it ever was. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters are illuminated - Sue is foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father is a good example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except briefly for Sue's Asian girlfriend, but even proves capable of domestic violence! As desperately uninteresting as they both have, I have no idea why either Rita and / or Sue would plunge into a complete creep like Bob - but since they do, why should I expect to break what happens to them? So many reviews continue to tell how "realistic" it is. If that's true, it's a sad reflection on society, but no need to put it on film. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie at all.
