I watched this movie the second night and I must honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The action is fair, but the plot is quite ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the "energy used to make the movie" and if the movie is burned, kills the killer? How incredible is that? The signs were underdeveloped to say the least ... for example, suddenly the man mentions "You're not trying to complete the movie because your mother couldn't?" So, should we follow this? We had no idea that it was her daughter until halfway through the movie. The movie really did not spotlight anyone, we didn't know anything about the main people who survived, except Ringwald's character was a whiney actress, the guy was on the set when the people died, and Raffy would be the director like his mother. Don't really dive in to know who they are. Seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings. The whole plot is too weak for my taste and I was very disappointed. Anyone who benefits from this shot must, of course, learn one or two things about film making. I can't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this image. It's not fun, it wasn't scary and was clich√© throughout the movie. I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene that believes I was not hard to do. It's a disgrace, and I'm deeply saddened by the fact that I wasted one and a half and a half at the fair. 10.1.
