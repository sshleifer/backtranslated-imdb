Awwww .... yes, it is cordial and all that an unfortunate family is adopted by ABC / Sears and has their home "renovated". This is where the humanistic appeal ends. I liked it early in his race, but now this show has been disgustingly excessive. Ten families need to be able to get relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every family, as every episode of this show splashes. The people at Habitat for Humanity will shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old boy to have a whirlpool in the bedroom, or have his bed distressed with "Low Rider" hydraulics? Does her mother really need her fake, non-running and equipped old pickup truck restored and "pimped" by some of the best adapters in California? A new one would have done the job pretty well and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a 60-inch plasma screen in every room in the house? And then there is the question of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills. Even after zaniacs on "Makeover" have gone, there is still a servant. I doubt the friendly people down at Social Services will see humor in all of this largely. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a rating grabber for ABC, and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
