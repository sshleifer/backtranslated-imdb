SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw half of this movie and I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> First reason: Drilling. Nothing happens, the women sit and discuss how terrible their lives are, and how they have no hope of smoking weeds, reading magazines, caring for their sick friend, and cutting the occasional dead body. BORING! <br /> <br /> Second reason: There are too many things inexplicable. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, holds them in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know about illegal activity on the sick carnivores? Why does he kill one and let another go? <br /> <br /> There is also this guy who at the beginning also believed that the meat had eaten disease, but he put his fist through a wall with superhuman strength, suggesting that he is not quite what we originally thought - never explained! How frustrating is it? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologist boring and the action non-existent. The cover is also misleading as it makes you think that this movie gets cool when it's clearly not. I rented this movie from some of the reviews made by other people on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people may have had this flick, from now on I will make sure I read more than two reviews deeply in a movie To avoid hiring another movie I regret to see.
