I am a Christian who generally believes in theology taught in the left behind. That said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> To get a good movie, you need a well-written script. Left Bag fell sharply on this. Second, it differs radically from the book. Sometimes it's made to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour movie, but in this movie I saw changes that didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> Another thing that is zero character development. When characters in the story are stored (I don't want to say who), the book makes it clear that it is a long, soul-seeking process. In the film it is fast and artificial. The book is written properly enough, where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham work right, but the movie scenarios consistently give the quick treatment without anything significant. In another scene, where one character gets angry to be left behind (again, I don't want to say who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize as a Christian, it is unpredictable for me to say I did not like this movie, but I cannot in good conscience recommend a movie that I feel was terribly done. Maybe it would have been better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. Regardless, Christians need to realize that we are being taken seriously as filmmakers, we must start by putting together a movie in a quality way. I realize that a lot of effort probably went into the left behind, but that's the way I look at it.
