The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really did the highest performance, and the girl who played her sister was truly amazing and beautiful. I seriously thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I watched the movie before I read the book. This is a little too "right" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louise's witty little tiffs to the battle of the slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did. The film was destroyed for me; I could hardly stand to see the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I won't give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not my type of show.
