This film is like the material S.E. Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s, and if Trueblood had actually been a product of either, the results could have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a pretty bad piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street fighter, I assume is the exact description. It was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid-30s and dressed them up in fat bars or some more uniform selection of band movies and they fought against lousy 80s music. Nevertheless, Ray is the only guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), who he has to leave inexplicably in a train station when he is nabbed by the police and forced to earn time in the marines. Look forward to today's day, and Ray is back in the city looking for his brother, who has also become part of the street band, although in a gang was Ray's opponent and now old scores have to be severely settled (and again, the police must be counterfeit And this time, a lady defended honor in action movie sense before Ray can continue life in the normal way with his brother, Donny. For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of this is about too much overactive, but not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn, who plays the waitress he turns to. The guys in the gang and Lowe themselves seem to make a little unnecessarily exaggerated as New York Street Toughs. Although the larger suspension is recycled plot lines and perhaps some kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product from 1989.
