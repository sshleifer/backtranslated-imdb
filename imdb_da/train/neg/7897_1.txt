This movie was made for people who found Gremlins for serious and Critters two hardcore. Like many of the critters / trolls / gremlin's films from the 80s, this film is bad. The sad part is that there is no punchline for that comment. It's just bad and not fun. The problem with this miniature movie is that it actually tries to be fun and ends up being so successful in doing what Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the other 80's horror movies to classics was that they were really trying to be scary but were funny because they mistakenly failed. Someone should have told Bettina Hirsch (yes THE Bettina Hirsch) she had a talent for comedians before she started controlling this movie. Unfortunately, they were wrong. It was fun to see a strange little mutated cross between a fruit and a tumor wearing a brown trench coat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the Lost Boys. It's fun, but not enough to save movies. <br /> <br /> By far the most annoying part of the movie is Paul's character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to get you started fast forward from the time of his first scene until the final credits only stop once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guy ... not that I did. So the bottom line is run, don't go to your nearest Blockbuster and push your hands with the manager and thank you for not having grapes to store this pile of garbage on the shelves.
