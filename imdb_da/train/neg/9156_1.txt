Ben & Arthur could have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director and left the actor to someone who could act. This is a good example of a person who controls the entire production. There was no one to tell him, "Sam's bad, really bad". <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabriel's play was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good instructor and better actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). The action and direction were so bad, this movie turned into a comedy. You should just laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> Another good point .... this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
