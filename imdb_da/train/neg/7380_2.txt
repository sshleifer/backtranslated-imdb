I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen does his direct video publishing in the last few years, resembling his early 90's smash hits in comparison. A secret bio laboratory creates a new form of substance that puts a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow, Seagal has to stop the infection or its end of the world ... or something. Seagal also went through hit squads as jellybeans. Every time I looked up, he was given a new face, so it was a little difficult to follow character development as well. I know Steven's athsma prevent him from shouting at the top of the lungs, but even so why is he constantly being baptized by people who don't sound like him? Normally, the movie's plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time, but it wasn't even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shaft stabbing rather than straight up fight. The problem was that it wasn't really scary, and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people had to speed up the light movement, but the 40-year-old 280lb Seagal killed them all individually? I suppose the movie's only highlight was the first 20 minutes when the new recruits asked Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
