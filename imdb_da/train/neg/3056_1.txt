Before I had seen this, I had seen some pretty bad Christmas movies. But when I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a jolly movie about Santa that helps some kids, but it feels almost demonic to see it. Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaced by an evil, devilish grin that I'm sure has beaten many children away from Christmas. The foundation of this massacre is very strange, which fits in with all the ideas and dialogue. Santa Claus lives high above the Earth in the North Pole, where he and children from all over the world get ready for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch or Satan. Pitch tries to destroy Santa's Christmas by making three boys cheeky and by creating leads, like moving the chimney and making the door handle warm. When Pitch gets Santa to be attacked by a dog, it's up to Santa's helper Pedro and Merlin, the guide to getting Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more happy than Santa. Santa Claus is talking about delivering gifts to all boys and girls, but he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of children in Mexico. The reindeer closes toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed that it doesn't bring tears to the baby's eyes ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes is simply Santa playing the organ while children sing to it. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting. Pitch in butt with a mini cannon and laugh fun over it while Pitch dances around in pain. I think parents are better off telling their young children where babies come from than showing them here. The only positive is that it will let you laugh hysterically if you can appreciate poor cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
