Ah, channel 5 by local mexican t.v. Every day, at 2:00 am, they fly Horror movies from the 70s to the early 2000s. It was the "Return to Cabin By The Lake" movie that was broadcast yesterday. I'm sorry to see it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By the Lake" was a regular popular low budget and it was well accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even accidental fun and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really silly throughout the meaning of the word. <br /> <br /> The movie on some points resembles a soap opera because of it's absurd dialogues, filmography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: Avoid this at any cost. It's a movie that it shouldn't be seen by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre filmmaking. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
