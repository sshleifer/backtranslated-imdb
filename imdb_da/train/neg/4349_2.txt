This movie is horrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a fantastic movie. Goodgfellas it is not only its one of the better crime movies done. This movie should be considered closer to STING Part2 or maybe Speed ​​Zone. Remember these gems! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult after the original one. This film lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard on. There was not a sympathetic sign, and it is the blame of everyone responsible for doing so. I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE, it may and may even invent some new categories to allow it to be a record holder. After I watched this S @ * T FEST movie, I sat and watched the original Carlito way of getting the bad taste out of my mouth. After seeing this, I wish Pachanga would come and knock me out of my misery.
