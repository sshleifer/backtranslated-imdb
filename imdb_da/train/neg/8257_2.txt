"A Gentleman's Game" uses the golf game in a country club setting to illustrate a youngster's discovery of honesty, prejudice, and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was going, just to be shown wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was going, either. The crucial moment in this movie is probably the scene where Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and debunks any notion that he becomes a mentor to the young golfer. It is refreshing in a way that this film refuses to follow most of the simplified and overtime movie formulas. But too much of it still comes out as designed. By the fall of a hat, people release all presumptions of politeness or fail to hold onto the things they believe in or are subjected to something far less respectable than their place in society assumes. Unfortunately, there are often no solutions to these moments. And apart from the fact that the club serves as a backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or interconnection between them. It's a shame that the authors and director couldn't save a better movie, especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup.
