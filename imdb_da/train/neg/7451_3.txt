Sorry, it's not good. It starts interesting, but loses a few minutes into the movie. It doesn't help much that none of the normally good actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc.) deliver a really good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be because I saw a dubbed version (German), but Dennis Quaid's character was especially wood and annoying, and Danny Glover doesn't really make a credible villain. In addition, Jared Leto's character does not really contribute to the story at all (except to save a protagonist's life at a time, but that scene is as necessary as a grape viper on a submarine initially ;-) <br /> <br /> Scenes - The main complaint is really the clumsy and clich√©-ridden story: The detective (of course!) has to solve a personal matter with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official duties his personal abstraction. The killer (of course!) * Want * to be tracked and play a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I don't know how many movies are based on a similar plot - most of them better, though. <br /> <br /> The plot has loads of holes and many incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the story at all (eg the car or car stop on the edge of the cliff, etc.) <br /> <br /> First, the end tries to be original and exciting, but completely fails in these respects. We've seen * much * better finals with a similar kind of ultimate match-on-a-train-in-one-abandoned-winter-landscape setup ... Finally, there is the seemingly floating reunion of parents and children ... hokey , at least.
