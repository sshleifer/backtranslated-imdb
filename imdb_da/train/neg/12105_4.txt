This was a disappointing movie. The people do not seem to have any substance, the main president Martin Cahil has zero resolution values, in fact everyone in the inclusive Jon Voight epitomizes sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is unpleasant, but artfully done. The film is too black, at least the print I saw fits this category. A disappointment.
