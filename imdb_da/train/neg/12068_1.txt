A family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week, otherwise they will lose their inheritance, which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to keep and keep the house in order. People die (and you will, too, if you try to sit through this). If you've ever wanted to see bad actors - many with poorly-fitting dentures - act or try to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance. This is just awful. It was so bad that I thought Al Adamson, one of the worst instructors ever, corrected it, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, I don't want to say anything more about it, not because it's not. It's not polite, but because I can start sometime, I can't stop. <br /> <br /> Avoid
