"Algie, Miner" is a bad and unfunny silent comedy. Timing of slapstick is completely off. This is the kind of humor with specific sequences that makes you wonder if they should be fun or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a compulsory show for movie buffers because it is one of the earliest examples of gay people. Algie's main character is a uniform guy who works much like the stereotype "pansy" that is common in many early films. The film has the homophobic attitude on time. "Algie, Miner" is pretty awful, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
