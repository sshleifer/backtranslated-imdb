This show made me feel physically ill and completely detached from the British community as a whole. There were programs like this and Blue Peter who pretended there were / are no class divisions in the UK. They always wanted to say things like; "Go into your loft and you can find it here." Or "Enter your backyard tonight and ..." - what about us "scummy" working club kids who never never had "loft" and a "backyard" that was no more than a 1 meter high balcony on the 14th floor of a council block? Public services broadcasting - yes right! And to top it off, it was terribly depressing to see the stupid middle classes standing up on their own backside, confused with old plastic plates that had 'fun' ... do me a favor and "why don 'you" Turn your wrists or make a cola overdose on "Mama and Papa's" money ... you make me sick
