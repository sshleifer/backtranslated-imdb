War, Inc. - Corporations take over the war in the future and use a lonely murder Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their wet work against rival CEOs. A dark comedy satirises both the military and the companies. It was often difficult to find out what had just happened. I waited for things to make sense. There is no reason or method of madness. <br /> <br /> It is considered by Cusack to be the "spiritual successor" to Grosse Point Blank. Eg. Is the war more or less a groundbreaking one. We see again Cusack as an assassin who protects * spoiler * the person he is supposed to kill as he grabs his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks a bit credible and takes a dozen guys with relative ease. The short battles look good. The rest of the movie doesn't. It is quite quirky that often borders on bizarre. War Inc is not fun enough to be a parody and too good for anyone to think about what the film's message may be, which I suppose may be the heartless ways that companies such as warfare compete and plan without a drop of thought to how they affect average citizens Interesting, but the satire just doesn't work because it's not fun and in the heart the movie has no heart. We have to confuse how the war affects the Cusacks shell of a sign rather than the millions of lives torn apart at war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a decent performance. His character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the least private plane, but quirks are meant to replace traits. Marisa Tomei slumbering as the romantic sidekick journalist. There really isn't much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and does not fool herself. Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. Blech. Ben Kingsley may have to return to Oscar if he doesn't start off a decent performance now and again. Pathetic. It's not a horrible movie, but in the end you should ask "War, what is it good for?" Absolutely nothing. C-
