WOW! Pretty terrible things. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably mind-boggling Tennessee Williams failure. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow who is fast-paced over her minions on an island where she loudly dictates her memoirs to an incredible patient secretary. When scoundrel Burton proves to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes that her time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme --- it's hard to decide if Taylor and Burton seem bad OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unpleasant. If so, then the play is brilliant! Burton mumbles her lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor creeps her. She's really awful. Then Noel Coward is like Taylor's cat confidant, "The Witch of Capri". <br /> <br /> Probably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes, but it's so misdirected by Losey that Taylor and Burton didn't spell it for the audience under their most eerie monologues, which fabric the film has, would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has great photography --- the camera should have been out of focus to boost the beauty of Sardinia! Support cast has Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as his eerie dwarf guard ... both he and his dogs make a number at Burton!
