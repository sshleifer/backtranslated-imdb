Of all the fawning people have done over Miike and his work. I sat through this flick tonight. I figured if it's half as good as Ringu, which I assumed from these comments, maybe it will be worth my time. <br /> <br /> No such luck. <br /> <br /> I am all about finding the next great instructor (or author) but I don't think Miike is the one. I don't have a NYU artist, but I know a lot: a horror movie must have pacing. It must also give the viewer more credibility than this movie does. <br /> <br /> This movie's pacing made me shake my head. Some of the scenes at the end hit so badly, I went to the fridge and slept there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for apparent minutes at the end, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous instructor once made the claim, and I switch, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and rolling it. Kou is not a good enough actress to do the job. She stares the lamb on the undead girl for more scenes than I usually remember. And she is not the only one who imitates a deer in headlights; Other cast members apparently seem to need to imitate this lack of performance. The scripture gives them little space to do much else for too much of the time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. Hong Kong's action movies from the last 30 years, Korean scares like "Phone" and "Coma", Ang Lee's work, some of the sweet but fun Filipino movies with free sex and struggle, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.
