This movie is announced as a smart romantic comedy. It is neither wise nor romantic, and it is certainly not an effective comedy. Fortunes of the well-known yet pathetic character, "Tom," fluctuate from an extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only rescue grapes are the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we welcome Paltrow's comfortable face. Overall, avoided!
