I went in expecting the movie to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any kind of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but it was fun to poker fun in the nonsense that goes on in single departments. <br /> <br /> This said there were many things about The Singles Ward that were quite annoying. The whole movie was badly doubled and made to look mouth while listening to their voices very annoying. This lack of professionalism was only exceeded by Mormon's celebrities who have nothing to do with. <br /> <br /> This movie will work well among Mormon Domes, especially in university communities where the single department exists. But the conclusion will not give any hope to the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (Only the beautiful girls in Singles Ward get married, the fat, the ugly don't, but all the nasty men do) In the end, we realize that the whole movie was an ad for LDSSingles.com
