Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to chaperone him and make sure he didn't get in the way of gold diggers. Such a lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the stage of women's rejection. We follow the story as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escort role they have agreed to perform in the 3 months that the bill is in New York while Bill meets Cleo and another woman . In the end, love in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story is mixed with music, but the songs are bad, and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not that good either. He is comfortable enough, but only really comes alive when playing drums or trombone. There is a very annoying character playing a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the movie is just boring.
