This piece of dirt is almost impossible to follow. The sound is crazy The picture quality goes from bad to worse for good to bad again! Things happen without apparent reason, characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during his production? <br /> <br /> Bad movie remotely, story is fake, just sick maliciously. If you want rape, murder and self-harm, it's just up to your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough, you can enjoy the clips of the actual people being executed. I saw almost everything, but had to turn off after seeing brains from some. Never before have I seen a movie that left me so shameful and dirty.
