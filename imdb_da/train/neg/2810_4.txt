I am surprised by the many female voters who even give this movie better grades. My idea about this movie was that the target audience is adult and male. Whipped and tortured women, relentless revenge and a high body number are typical ingredients introduced into the film history of spaghetti subgenre. The opening and hand break are DJANGO rip-offs. The shooter, however, lacks the style of eg. Django. Score, acting and filmography are at best mediocre, but if you're looking for the above ingredients, you're in the right place here. And the actors don't have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
