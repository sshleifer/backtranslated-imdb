Vampires Vs. Zombies were not the original title. It was actually ... Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Come Hit by Cars: Special Guest Appearance of Bob the Lesbian Gypsie Witch and Her Dog, Random Woman with Special Powers and Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: No plot - only the author and the instructor will understand the end or something else in this movie. <br /> <br /> However, I really love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even enjoy lesbians. This movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, horrible (I mean really bad) dialogue and random STUFF and PEOPLE who have nothing to do with anything (or do they ... I didn't knows what happened in the world). Oh, and I can't forget the green oatmeal 'Zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their zombies hand in oatmeal and paint). In any way, the result was this scary bad movie if you could even call it. <br /> <br /> Was the ending probably not sensible? The vampire was really a nurse, and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where was the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the vampires at all ... you really couldn't call any of the girls' vampires. No matter what. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you're really curious ... okay, I understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies will not be able to stand this. It must be number 1 on the bottom 100.
