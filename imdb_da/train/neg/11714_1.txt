The United States seems to be running the British police, all of whom run around armed to the teeth and knew that CID officers are changing into uniform when they stop working and go down in the pub! This should be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of "real" British police who have ever been foisted on the unsuspecting audience. I can see that Mr Snipes might need the money to pay his repayment account, but what a good actor like Charles Dance did in that is a mystery. Worse than the worse low budget "B" movie from the 50s. An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as the real plague.
