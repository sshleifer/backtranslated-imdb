A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you were expecting an impartial documentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or just an anti-Zionist --- nothing wrong with committing the destruction of a country or not) to support Palestinian goals (eg, Mass murder, Israel's destruction), the documentary is for you. Must provide an entertaining evening at college campuses around the UK and the United States. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be angry at the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope that those who really are not aware of the situation are not destroyed by this anti-Semitic filth.
