This movie was absolutely horrible! I can't understand how this movie made it into production. Nothing against the movie of the movie, of course, is all that is due to the writing team. You take the old average plot - let's dance our way out to be poor and poor - or STEP in this case. But this lacks any kind of a true plot - or at least one that someone would like. With Canadian speaking actors in what should be an American setting - this movie is falling very flat. In a positive way, it was really good to manage and cinematography was also quite decent. It seems that the production budget was also very generous. My only request is that this team leave writing alone and go along with finding actual writers to help them bring words to life on film. Net result - How she moves, how she sucks.
