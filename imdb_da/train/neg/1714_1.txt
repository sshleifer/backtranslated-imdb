Once again, a movie classic has been relentlessly restored with predictable disastrous results. The title is wrong, just as it is all about this movie. The period is not convincingly reproduced, and the leaders seem too young and too quick to be criminals themselves. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view and was made by talented people. Although the 1967 edition did not exist, it would still be an unnecessary movie. The 1967 version declined from fact, presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative in 1967, and it had some excellent performances that allowed you to care. This 1992 remake seems to be deleted from the original movie rather than the truth as known, and the actors in this version are callow, unappealing, and not least interesting. Skip this one at all and hope the 2010 version will improve. Could it be worse?
