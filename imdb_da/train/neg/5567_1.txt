Okay, I rented this movie because of the instructor ... he made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork, you're missing a fun ride). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the start, but I decided to suck it up and give it a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers, read on. First of all, the old saying goes: "You can't judge a book by that cover". The checkout box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is rocky with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of red leather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. You start to see it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a total dog that is not the girl on the front. The movie is not as predictable as you would think ... and that's not a good thing. Signs do so many stupid things without any motivation of motivation ... it's embarrassing to see. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no reason. Also, what was the intention of having Dolph kill this second lady in cold blood who had helped him. Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stink when he read the script. Had it been put in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters half-intelligent, it could have been decent. Putting it in the 70s makes no sense and has no bearing on history at all. Avoid it!
