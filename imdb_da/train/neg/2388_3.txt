No one should ever try to customize a Tom Robbin's book to the screen. While the film is good and the performance is good, the dialogue that works well reads it crazy when it is spoken. Or to put it another way, no one would probably suggest hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a gem. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie feels like a badly adapted rock book Notes to the book - most parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of backstory and current history, and the end is wild (and uncomfortable) different from the book. Most of the plots from the book have been lost, including the one that makes all sense at the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read in relation to the book, burned, and all the actors sent off to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even any of his caliber could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making miniseries.
