Following the overvalued success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films spread as a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is everything in movies like El segundo nombre, a TV-like production that is poorly written, but acted and corrected even worse. I didn't read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I'm sure the author of The Doll Who Ate Its Mother didn't have much in common with this horrible production. Avoid it at all costs unless you are looking for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater. 2.10
