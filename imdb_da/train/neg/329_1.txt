First: I bought it in the video store. Other: I saw it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It wasn't fun. Fifth: Most of the antics were paralyzed. And last but not least: It's not just a bad movie, it's a total failure. <br /> <br /> I am a huge Adam Sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I apologize for it because it was his first movie. Even if you are a huge Adam Sandler fan, don't bother watching this movie. Instead, just take the video, control a yacht and throw it overboard.
