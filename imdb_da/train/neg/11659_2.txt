I loved the original Scary Movie. I'm a big fan of parody - it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the most intelligent form of humor. Wayan's boys seemed to understand this concept perfectly in the original movie, so forgot about it temporarily when they did the sequel. I think Wayans' is a family of comic geniuses. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with promise. I liked "The Exorcist" parody, especially "come out, ma" gag. Now it is material from Wayans quality. But apart from that, I can only think of two other times, I laughed: 1) When the Tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, it becomes sticky and begins to talk about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he says, "It was just a booty call !!" It was a little fun. 2) "Save the Last Dance" parody in which the Cindy character accidentally strikes a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the frightening movie's side-casting laugh. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure trash bin filled with cheap gross-out gags. Witnesses from the first movie, which were subtle or implied, are magnified and overdone. For example, in Scary Movie I, several innuendos have been made to mean that the character Ray is homosexual. This was fun. But in Scary Movie II, the entire penis strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was fun and numb. This is the whole movie's pattern. Shock humor * alone * doesn't take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As much as it pains me to judge a Wayan movie so low, I have to give this a 2 out of 10.
