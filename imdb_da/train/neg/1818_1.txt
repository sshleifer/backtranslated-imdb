Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is sometimes beautiful topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, folks. The only reason to even consider watching this movie or not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, these 70's sexual exploitation pieces are entertaining because of their very dated (flared pants, large hair, Zapata mustache, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the play is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a senior-romantic leader is unusually bad. <br /> <br /> The title indicating a sex comedy is roughly misleading. I heartily recommend avoiding this as the plague.
