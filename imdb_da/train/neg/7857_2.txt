Isn't any other tired of the old clich√©, where an almost dead person appears in a horror movie, gives us some information, and then he blows his head for no apparent reason? I know I am. The sad thing is that it is use in this movie, is worthless. If you've seen the first movie (the first remake I should say) then the information given is completely worthless because you already knew it. You can do that, it's not worthless to the protagonists. But why shoot the idiot himself in the head? Wouldn't he live? Sure he would be dead anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie entitled "The Hills Have Eyes II." The first is the sequel to the original 70 movie. This is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me. Look, I'm probably part of a minority of people of my age who even knew there was an HHE2 at first, much less an original HHE1. And now we have a successor to a remake and the fact that this successor is exactly like the successor to the original HHE1 ... it just makes it worse! Yet. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills have eyes were decent. Eventually, the idea was better than the presentation, but he probably had a low budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not so good for a horror director. He has only made a few good horror films (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), a few good (Scream) and a bunch of terrible (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yes, and he made Swamp Thing too ... but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category. I've only seen a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he's written with the new HHE2..and that's such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original film. It was tense. I suppose it was related to the fact that the protagonists were a family, not a bunch of beers and pots and sex cats teenagers. It made us feel dirty. For the first hour we were in hell, and at the end of the last moments the good people got revenge on the evil guys, and it felt good. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no excitement. No excitement at all. Only violent things happen to mostly stupid people. There is hardly any threatening presence here. Just ugly hobos hiding under stones. <br /> <br /> I get tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they still make. It was just the second day that I saw the "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk around the water while he was talking, and then he was eaten by a shark just because the idiot remained close to the water. Something nobody would do in the given situation! Here is exactly the same thing. People go by themselves to take a leak, even though they know people are dying .. seriously, couldn't a pot break? And then, when you think people would have learned, another goes by itself! Seriously is it no more scary when the characters bring their A games and still lose? I would think it ... <br /> <br /> It even during deliveries. It should have made the first remake look like "The Fog" remake (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More excitement. More of everything. <br /> <br /> But it's actually downgraded. Less evil. No excitement. Sure we have more time in the caves, but not much is happening there. Finally, it only seems like there are two or three bad guys. The last film made it a whole tribe of people. Where's this tribe? Who is watching them through binoculars? Seriously, it is these things that this film should have brought us, but it ends with the same promise that the last movie gave us, with the very same "watched" scene. Come on! I'll blame the devil for that. The film's appearance is good, but it is. <br /> <br /> I don't even think fans of Gore will like this .. Though I'm probably wrong! There are gore (although most are sped-up in the dark), but without the tensions and signs you even dislike. Gore does nothing in my book! In the end you are not afraid. You are not shocked (unless you are an 8 year old girl). You don't even feel you've seen anything new.
