I saw this on a whim because it was available and I had heard the Thumb movies were fun. This one was not. The majority of the jokes were based on "Geranium's" physics and in turn Kate Winslet's. I think it's really pathetic for the "Thumbtanic" creators to bow down so low to make jabs a respected actress just because she (the heaven forbids) doesn't starve into the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that looks like something: "Hi, I have a good idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift fleet that no one else sees!" Thirty seconds of entertainment out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem the value.
