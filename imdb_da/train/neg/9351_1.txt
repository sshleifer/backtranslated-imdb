This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD part. <br /> <br /> I was willing to give the film the benefits of doubt in the first place, although managed to be both shallow, cliched and stupid .. and joyless, plodding and pretentious. It was like a post-school special directed by the odd class nine child who believes no one understands him ... creepy and sad, with voice-over narration that Only the worst kid would consider poetry ... and some song and ... no, really the poor child's suffering ... Enough, already, especially when morphed into a brazen, clumsy and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. And do I mention the song? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but decided that I have felt at least forced to sit through. I do not recommend it to anyone.
