From what did she think? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a policeman in the future who is with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime case with a lunatic who wants to start another ice age. Straight to tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in itself. It was apparently a love work for his writer director Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end result is anemic, to be charitable. Goldberg's only on-screen presence can often spark good will and laughter, no matter how bad the script is, but here she drowns and you can see the unfunny results. No stars from ****
