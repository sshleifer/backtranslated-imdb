I wasn't quite impressed with this movie. It was originally named Sin Eater and should have stayed that way considering it's all about the last half of the movie. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had to do with any of the rest of it. It was very slow and what was about to pick Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the most important actors. It was a dull point. All in all, I want to say check this out if you are into things dealing with the Catholic religion, but don't expect an exorcist or Stigmata from this movie. It will probably flop after a few days and words come out.
