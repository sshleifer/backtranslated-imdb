Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his "House of 1,000 Corpses" crapfest, I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in "The Seven Corps House", but a groovie ghoulie still comes from his plot (ha!) Yet to kill the bloody amateurs who make a low clean horror flick in his previous home! In Hell House (sorry, I can't remember the real name of the residence) a lot of mysterious, inexplicable deaths took place long ago; some who arthritic lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose little role gives the film's only worthy moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing movie director John Ireland rejects it as superstitious loft. The result comes across as "Satan's School of Girls" (captivating title, TV-produced values, thrilling plot) crossed with "Children must not play with dead things" (low-cost film about low-end filmmakers who awaken the dead); Problems are, it's not as close as entertaining or fun. "The House of Seven Corpses" is dead in frame 1 and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, pulling us together for every aching second ...
