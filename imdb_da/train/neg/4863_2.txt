Why oh why not block movies just stick to their selling point? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see that talking animals made jokes, and while they did, we were all happy ... And then, as with Lost In Space, the two killer blowers - plot and mood . Who was really worried about what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with her daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
