DD movies were amazingly corny, damn stupid and had a plot that seemed wafer thin, but those days they were a plot anyway <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy but a mix of melodrama , romance everything </ br> Every drama scene is blown out of proportion. The comedy is fun, but corny too. The movie keeps you entertained, the days Govinda movies were loud, crass but they had some fun moments people enjoyed <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job Music is okay Govinda works well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in share and annoy in parts Kader is as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra is typecast Shakti is fun
