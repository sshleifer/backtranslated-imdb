Wow! This movie is really awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the green light. The cast is uniformly second rate with some really awful performances from virtually every cast. The story is uneven, fragmented and incoherent. That story, lead and predictable. No humor, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at least. The characters remain as flat as the crazy pancake. There is also a strong flow of misogyny, which became increasingly difficult to stomach when the film continued. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it is uphill from there. Despite the fact that love is triumphing over lust, I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humor and social comment, then we are absolutely doomed.
