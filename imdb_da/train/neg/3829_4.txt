Encapsulated bunches near Yuma break free their chain ties and heads to the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold that remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempts to bring the Western genre up-to-date with violence and brutality in the 1970s are not even in the same league as some of the newly born Westerns who emerged in the late 60s. It is impossible simply and square, with the female characters only around punching bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his craziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has a good moment, trying to read a letter and fumble for his glasses). James Coburn, like the half-grain half-race, is also much on auto-pilot, but Coburn has a way to transform even the highest dialogue and situations into something stinging and unnerving. It's his show all the way. * 1/2 from ****
