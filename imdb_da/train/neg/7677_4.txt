I stopped looking lost in this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's death were unnecessary and really depressing. Then I found out they were holding Libby around just to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. <br /> <br /> I liked this show for the first season, but it certainly fell in the second season, I found Jack and Locke's little religious feud to be annoying. The death of Rodriguez & Watro's was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode a 4/10, to be the end of my show of this former great series created by Alias ​​Legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve on this in the future.
