They had such potential for this movie and they fall flat. In the first cruel intentions, we leave what motivated the protagonists to stay as they are and work as they do. There is almost no sign development at all in this prequel. In fact, it's a very sad story, but this movie didn't matter to me. It was as if they issued good letters instead of unnecessary f-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and does not explain anything. The script was just awful. Another thing that bothered me was that they used to rent 3 of the EXACTIVE SAME lines that were in the original. Like the "down boy" or the kissing scene, and a few others, I can't remember. I wasn't impressed by Robin's plays, but Amy did a good job. It's about the only thing that unified this movie.
