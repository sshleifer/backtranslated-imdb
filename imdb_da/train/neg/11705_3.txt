This blanket melodrama is simply the worst movie with Ingrid Bergman I have seen. Even her glowing screen presence cannot save this inevitably slow and meandering movie that is almost impossible to pass through without speeding up a lot of it. Only for the tough Bergman fans; others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you see "For whom Bell Tolls" instead.
