I'm not one of those people who just go online after I watch a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you have any doubts, please look at my other reviews. But for the first time ever, I've seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good. However, there is not a single good thing I can say about this movie. The reason is largely non-existent. If anyone reads my review wasting their money to see it, they can distinguish for themselves what the plot might be, but I recommend that a nickel be worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are bad. The action is bad. <br /> <br /> The two leaders are attractive, but that's all there is. I'm not the type to destroy a movie to anyone, but I invite someone to email me to foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before wasting a penny on it. I will tell you something. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new inventive movies. I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel (As some reviewers claimed this was like, but of course they only thought because Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made. <br /> <br /> And before ignoring this review, it comes from a person who not only sat through the Whole House of the Dead but actually bought a copy of it.
