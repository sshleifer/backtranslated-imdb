First, the title character is not even the film's main character. He's the cult leader's sidekick. The actor, who portrays Igor, thought that screaming loud, grinning and grinning smiles as you opened your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of shouting (because he never actually spoke) in a high pitched voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example, when the cult leader kills one of his followers with a buzz saw, I shout when I see this, yelling out "Paul! No Paul! Why did you do that? I could have cut her clean! So clean!" In another scene, Igor tells a victim that she needs to "get her own tools for surgery, because right now it was time to operate." Except for the bad play, the end didn't make sense, because while the story builds up what little steam it has against the climax, which is Igor, who gets a crossbow arrow to his head and the rest of his lunatic friends are killed, he shows up again to kill the remaining 'good guys'. The film does not explain this, but tells the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What??? The bottom line is not wasting your time watching this movie. I wish I could get back the moments I lost looking at this.
