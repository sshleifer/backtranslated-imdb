First of all ... I've never considered myself a Uwe Boll Hater since I think I never even saw one of his movies but after watching this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed "(called the serial killer this movie is about) I'm close to joining the hat club. This movie makes absolutely no sense ... the plot is a joke, and while Boll is clearly trying to get the attention of shocking people, 90% of this movie is simply boredom. You can summarize this movie as this: <br /> <br /> 1. Hooded Killer watches that animal clips are tortured on television. This is real material from potted plants and the film opens with the ridiculous reason to "make a statement about humanity" and give a Peta address. Since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn exploitation, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning forward. <br /> <br /> 2. Death by electrocution with pretext giving away what happens later in this movie printed on the screen so that every retard gets it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watch videos of animals, babies, and women starving to death and decomposing in the seed cell, have stupid nightmares and cry into their whiskey because Seed is such a bad, bad opponent. Although the play is OK, the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. Cop's bust Look at his house, act silly and get cut in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you hardly see anything but lights. Seed is a super killer who is everywhere at once, and all policemen seem stupid enough to be killed ... except for the one who busts him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as long as anything else in this "movie" ... he won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he should be free if he survives 3 electric hoops. Guess what ... they bury him right to life to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. Seeds come out of their grave, kill everyone in another slash, and then seek the main fight to avenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman gets her head basked in with a hammer in an endless order from a point of view just for fun and the shock value of it. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed catches the police family, lures him to his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the police shoot themselves in the head considering that what Seed wants (it's hard to get into the head as he not only carries his mask even in prison, but also never speaks one words ... the movie has hardly any dialogue at least so nothing against it). <br /> <br /> 9. Ball goes to a nihilistic shocker end, where Seed locks the daughter in with his dead father to rot like the people we watched video on sequence 3. <br /> <br / > This is it ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that Seed was burned like a child. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a few key scenes and their shock value. I hardly remember a movie empty of any feeling or message or entertainment. It likes to see August Underground ... it's fine with me, some people will enjoy this brainless snuff. But what is really hard to stand by is the pseudo-message at the beginning, and the fact that the film is well-made considering camera work, effects and even the play is too good for this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets ?? "Seed" is not just the essence of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky Uwe that the German taxpayer pays too much of this waste to get deductions.
