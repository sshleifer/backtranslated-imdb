This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its overall political correction make it really childish, with only good / bad signs. The world is just not like that, and good films show complex signs with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. But what I most HAT on this movie is the father of Bola's friends. The director is trying to teach us a good lesson: Tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad, in fact, they can be better than the average handsome father (wow, it's like ... philosophy or something). Thanks, Achero. I would suggest you to the Nobel Prize for Literature.
