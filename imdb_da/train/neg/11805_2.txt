See the original with the same title from 1944! This made for television movies, is just god-horrible! Although it uses (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialogue, it just doesn't work! Is that the act of the poor leader? OK, so it's made for television, but why see a bad copy when you can get your hands on the amazing original? Especially as you will be pampered at the plot and will not enjoy the original as much as you have seen it first! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that differ from the original (it's shorter for one time), but everyone is worse! The actors play the parts here, just don't fit the bill! You just don't believe them and who could survive Edward G. Robinson's performance from the original? If you want, just watch it after you've seen the original, and then you'll be very brave if you see it through! It's almost sacrilege!
