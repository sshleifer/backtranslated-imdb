Bela Lugosi as a creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to awaken brides to steal the essence of life for the aged wife. The midget of this movie is fun !! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of upholstery and no plot makes watching the movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces eventually collapsed in typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting and you feel helpless as you see. Normally I would score drilling flicks like this low, but the midget just added enough creepiness and entertaining to get a few more points.
