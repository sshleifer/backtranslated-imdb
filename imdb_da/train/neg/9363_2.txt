This movie has some fatal errors in it, how anyone could go through an open back door of a very secure medical facility is incredible. Then the same person just goes around the plant and enters Dr.'s office, is just bad writing or poor editing. <br /> <br /> Very very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was made except it was filmed in Canada and probably received a state grant. <br /> <br /> I must say that the person who played Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television, I will say it will kill some time, but otherwise it is a movie, no actor will have on their resume.
