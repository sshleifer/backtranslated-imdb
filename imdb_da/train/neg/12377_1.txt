Just because a person is under 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie, you'd better have him / her tested. I am constantly amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that is so bad. This "movie" is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else. Scripture is horrible. I can't remember when I have heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are more than miserable. The actor is underperforming, but then the actors were not given much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He cannot sing, and he is ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst is the openness of everything. It's as if the authors went out of their way to make it as stupid as possible. Big children's films are evil, clever and full of wit movies like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches to name two of the past. But in the continued dumbing-down of Americans flock more to kill as Finding Nemo (yes that's right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and eye-crossing waste like Red Riding Hood.
