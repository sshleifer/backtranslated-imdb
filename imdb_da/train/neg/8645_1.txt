I just got back from this free screening, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the downward worst movie I've seen this year, worse than even "Catwoman" - who had a decency to at least pass herself as fiction. <br /> <br /> In September, Tapes, a "movie crew member" of "documentary journalists" leads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the journey, conditions and, oh well, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on September 11 - to track Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The "made" eight ties on their journey, which now "documents" their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, fortunately, end all points that are significant in the narrative, which is practical for a "documentary.") The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - given to long important speeches that he probably learned to see "MacGyver" - cares nothing for his or her own life or the life of his innocent crew, as he is endangering them more and more through a series of stupid accidents. I don't know why he didn't just have a sign on his back saying "Shoot me." <br /> <br /> The crew's translator, apparently their sensible voice-of-reason, does a little more than gnaw and gets confused as the hero of the idiot leads them to destruction. <br /> <br /> You want them to have brought someone on their journey to call them all morons. <br /> <br /> Around "Tape 4" I began to row for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.
