If this film was about a fictional character, the film could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are shadowed very unfairly to Ruben Carter. Many of the minor facts were ignored (Carter was not the only one struggling at the time of the murders, there is no evidence at all that he rescued a friend from a nursery childhood in his youth), but some of the major facts that apparently Being robbed of a decision by Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexplicable to those of us who have seen the battle for ties and completely disrespectful to the Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who at best was in trouble and about problems much more than any normal person was (was arrested several times to beat women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never seeing his actions in the 60s and even now when he refuses to talk to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can lead, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is past me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all their bio pictures to make them credible? (Heres a suggestion What about Denzel about playing a movie about herself? Now it is inspiring) On the basis of all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest passing on this.
