This movie is just crap. Although the directors claim to be part of this oi culture, it is still a very, very poor director's debut. The subject itself is very interesting, and I accept the bad play because of the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this movie is the dialogues and very inexperienced and naive instructions. There is no timing at all in that movie. I felt that the directors were so excited to make that movie (it's their first move) that they never really asked themselves what story they were going to tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he is a nice and thoughtful guy, but it doesn't make him an instructor. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but somehow manages to transport a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, not telling anything new or provocative and (that is the sad thing about this movie) it is far from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> To watch weird but big German movies, watch the movies Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Bennys Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Last Movie The Experiment The Weiss Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** out of ten because of the subject and the photography
