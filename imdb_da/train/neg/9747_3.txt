Ok first and foremost, this movie sucks. But let's examine why. The suggestion that a machine is capable of converting material into energy, storing it and then transporting it and restoring it, is at least exciting. But it is as far as they take this premise. Instead of diving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine, they broke the damn thing. This could have been a good assumption. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation, ie. the invisible man. But no ... they break the damn thing. And Lembach will leave. Then doctors doctor jerry rigs stuffed together again and try to transport themselves. Only to get it upset by its beautiful but stupid secretary, (duh). It would not happen if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he roams the country's side and kills people because his little experiment failed and they wouldn't give him money. Wah. Then, to make the movie worse, throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors employed to help him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while killing half of London. All of this could have been going by not breaking the damned machine, which would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried, so I gave it an honest 2 star for action, but it would have been better if they hadn't broken the horrible machine so Lembach left, so he tried it again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
