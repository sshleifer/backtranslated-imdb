Debbie Reynolds toe-taps, tangos and yes, tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller, which has a distinctly '30s atmosphere. Two ladies gathered together when their sons commit a murder attempt to start their lives by driving a tap-dance school to tots in Hollywood. Trouble is that one of them is afflicted by neuroses. Can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich, manager Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have allowed Joan so much screen time to stretch her stuff, and I can't imagine Bette Davis in the other role of knocking out her heart. This is a purely fake piece of macabre, written by a dormant Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to arrange the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). Not an ounce of honest fun in the whole lukewarm package. * 1/2 from ****
