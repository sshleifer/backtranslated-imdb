Ha. Tommy is undoubtedly the evil one here. I don't know why, but for some reason, small children in horror movies tend to come across so little bumps. and since they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... except for terrorism. but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway on the movie. Can't find this movie on DVD? of course you can! All you have to do is buy the Chilling Classics DVD package! Not only do you get Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES! what a bargain! PFF. OKAY. I have finished advertising these cheese films. Let's just say that this movie is not worth the 15 bucks alone. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemist. Yes. because all chemistry researchers look as beautiful as this guy plays Peter. He tries to come up with a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. the college he works on wants to pull the plug on his project so he tries it on himself. But because it's a horror movie, he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes almost 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> In order to decorate the film, he comes into a relationship with a woman who has a son and she was never married! outrageous! But of course, Tommy is one of the most annoying signs .... no. I'll take it back. He's the most annoying character. Far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over Peter's work and blaze over him while he is in the hospital. That's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be the villain. <br /> <br /> So we see Peter start killing some people in visions, he has by chance that he is the one who does it and just chooses to kill everyone in his way to get back to normal . But at the end, he ends up developing into a lizard. Yes, I do not know, do not ask. The ending really makes no sense. And if you hope for a really good payout, you won't get it. <br /> <br /> This is not an EXCELLENT movie .... it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff. If you already own the 50 movie package and that is the next on your list, you are not in a snoozer, but you are not in a good movie either. Just sit back, relax and eat a lot of snack food. Because this movie won't make you jump out of your skin anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizards out of 10.
