As a fan of Notorious B.I.G. I looked forward to this movie. I'm unlucky to see it's a horrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows Notorious B.I.G. true son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is as convincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this is these are the actual people they play. It was boring and gave no information on Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans both did not already know. I was especially disappointed by Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The film's snails and snails along the way think of Notorious B.I.G. Fans will spend lots of money on it. It is unfortunate to say that it happened. It's not close to a good movie. I expected so much from it, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted from this. I think you should definitely skip this one.
