The "Brain Machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive and try to figure out what it's all about. Four topics of different background and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the scientists as a scientific study of humans and the environment. Since the only common denominator among them is that they each have no known family, should have been a tip away - none of them will be missed. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is watched by a mysterious crib known only as the general, but it seems he is taking his direction from a senator wishing to remain anonymous. Well call that on the senator's side. There is also a shady guard constantly zooming in on the camera, which later claims that it does not take its direction from the general or 'project'. Too bad he wasn't more efficient, he was overpowered quite easily before it all went crazy. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the movie is a true treasure trove of the 1970s technology with repeated shots on phones, room size computers, and a teletype machine that won't quit. Perhaps it was the basis of the film's alternative title - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make sense. For myself, I would like to consider a title proposed by the murdered Dr. Krisner's experiment entitled 'Group Stress Project'. This applies to both the film's actors and viewers. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the Secretary-General's head at the pool when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom microphone is visible over the head for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> You might like to catch this flick if you are a Gerald McRaney fan, could he ever be so young? James Best is also shown in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptically reverent, but does not call him Father. For something a little more up to his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's "The Killer Shrews". The one who at least does not pretend to be so serious.
