I would like to make a "Holmes with Doors" proverb, but I can't quite string it all together. Suitable grubby and over edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time .... but how coy is this movie about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime film flashes it all the time and skips the graphic violence instead ..... as a celebrity once said about American cinema double standards: "kiss a breast and it's an X, staff it and it's an action PG 13" ... WONDERLAND is also 14 minutes long, and at the end the fog spiral was all happy to escape the cinema. How many films are called WONDERLAND? There must be six in the last decade. The pixelated violence and subdued color puts seedy tone, but the wobble cam becomes tedious as if we were gawking in their nostrils all the time. By taking a few signals from DOORS and TAXI DRIVER it will all be forgotten the next day.
