One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Trades were terrible for both the children and the adults. Most to all characters showed no, little or not enough emotions. The lighting was horrible and there were too many shakes about the time of the day the movie was shot (In the river scene where they just destroyed their boat, there are 4 shots: the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat, Jillian and Molly in the evening swim, the rest of the children during the day * when it comes to the evening * at the riverbank and the doctor Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not in the evening coming out of their boat.) The best actor in the movie was probably from the sheriff, Cappy (Although there is a sign list when the pulse detector * Whatever it is, when people die, it beeps * shows that Cappy is dead, he is still moving while it can still beep, and while the nurse extra controls his pulse manually, it shows the pulse again, and then he finally dies.) I think it won't be perfect as it is an independent movie, but it can still be better. Not worth seeing, honestly, even for kids. Can also see something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story, if you want to see something you want to remember.
