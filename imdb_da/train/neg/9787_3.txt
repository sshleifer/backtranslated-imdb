... but the hassle of this production is that it is very far from a good musical. Permitted, one cannot always expect the witty gentlemen such as Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; But the music in this piece even makes Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty. It is deadly boring and unexpected (with one or two exceptions) and just after I looked at it, I couldn't remember a single significant tune - which is quite tragic from a person who taught the whole hundred people from three listenings. <br /> <br /> It's also oddly un-theatrical. It is going on at an incredibly large stage (you really have to apologize to the people in the front rows who broke their necks to see something happening 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and do absolutely nothing with it. When there is a person singing on stage, it's just what you get - and the rest of that huge step is empty. For me, as an aspiring theater director, it was almost painful to see. In fact, Cole Porter remains better off catching the French culture in his works than these no-talents can ever get close to. And I'm confused by the popularity of this would-be-legendary musical.
