Once there was a science fiction writer named H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy" that was about a man who discovered a race of cute little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's writers began to plunder his grave before his carcasses became cold. This is the book where they got the idea for Ewoks from. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of "Little Fuzzy" I imagine why I am the only one who has ever noticed? <br /> But don't take my word for it. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg, where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
