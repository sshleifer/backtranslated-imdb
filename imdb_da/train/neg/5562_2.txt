This unpleasant movie has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action movie has allowed. And there are occasional excerpts of dialogue suggesting that the film might have been able to give an insight into a strange subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivations are either creepy or trite. Most of the play is underpair. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the instructor's unnecessary fascination with focusing on doing is distracting. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
