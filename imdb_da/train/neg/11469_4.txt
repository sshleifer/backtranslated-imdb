ORCA isn't exactly bad, but it's not really Richard Harris' finest hour either. As a demented, Ahab-like fisherman, Harris enters a game of death with a vicious killer whale after killing the whale's "wife" and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved in Harris. She shouts a lot at him about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and ends up in the arctic with the avenged bile whale. There are no special effects to talk about, except for what looks like a round mirror to a whale eye --- there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eye, so the audience understands the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris's crew has a particularly unpleasant run into Orca, and most of the supporters, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, also fail.
