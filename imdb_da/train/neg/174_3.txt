* Possible Spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The plot was not good and the plot was not even extremely interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a great television movie. The successor was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put much more in his character than in this. It seemed that HE wasn't even interested in making the successor. His play was good, but it could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because, in my opinion, they aren't even worth mentioning. But I do. Alison's character is not even hardly shown in the film's first part. Suddenly, she is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role didn't make sense, and it should have been thought out a little better. Dahlia Salem was horrible. Her plays were far below decent, and the casting people should have looked for someone else, someone else. Director Mike was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose for being there, but his death did not seem necessary. The action for this role was good, nothing great, but better than Salem. <br /> <br /> The reason was really miserable if you think about it. Stanley, supposed to be dead, makes his way to the phrase 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his script. He stumbled on the director and for a short time the director is dead and Stanley is running the show. Yes, out of nowhere will the crew just let this stranger get into the picture and finish the movie without knowing anything about him. There are some killings, not a whole lot, and one is shown is ridiculous. One of the actors on the set is electrocuted while shooting a scene. Another character is chewed up by a motor boat. And one gets intertwined in a plant before they drown. These writers must have been hard-pressed. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I wasn't impressed by the movie of the movie. The way it continued to change from seeing a low budget back to normal began to get annoying very quickly. The new cabin by the lake was also badly set up. We are not shown it, but only in a few scenes, and everything with the chain in the basement was useless. It only worked in the first movie because we were shown the room much more, but it didn't work here. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them except for few had no reason to be there. The action of the little one shown was really bad and ... they just had no purpose in this movie. All in all, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel pick up from where the first one left. 'Cabin by the Lake' I can take, but it just wasn't impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this, and so should you. It's not like the first thing, and it went way too slowly. Nothing happened in the first hour, and it continued to drag on for another. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need help getting to bed. So we see that Stanley defies death and still lives and good. In the way he speaks, it sounds like there could be a possible third tranche for a movie, well alone. Stop throwing in successors and that may be us! <br /> <br /> (Have the filmmakers not realized that they showed us how they filmed sea scenes from the first? They were all finished in a tank. Never, never reveal the secrets of the movies.) <br /> <br / >
