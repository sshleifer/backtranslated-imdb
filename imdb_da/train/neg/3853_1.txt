I think Jason Lee has great potential, but it was the wrong vehicle trying to break out like a star. The reason is horrible, the comedy is horrible. I laughed twice, thinking of relief because in retrospect they were rather paralyzed jokes. I myself was afraid of Fletch's future and had to consolidate myself that it was the movie that was flawless, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are warm, but I recommend looking at the post photos on this site to find out, instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star.
