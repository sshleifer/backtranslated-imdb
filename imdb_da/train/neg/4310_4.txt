This movie is about a very sexy Olympic track star who is hired to train a high school boys basketball team. Like Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, it is Stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role and she does as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but considering the movie's apparent TV movie budget, they probably couldn't afford her. Cathy Lee looks good in every shot, but we must never see her completely naked. The story is pretty predictable, at least, and gives no surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the male lead. He is the star of the team and also the love interest of Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some entertaining scenes like the rich old man running athletic program and does not think a woman should train sports. This item is brought up throughout the movie and it is of course dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put his team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she does not do anything a male coach would not. There is a fun subplot that involves a high and not so bright player who undergoes hypnosis to pass his classes and play as pro basketball player Sydney Wicks. It looks like everyone was happy to make this movie, but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not as big an actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very tan body.
