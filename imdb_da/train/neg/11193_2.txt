OK, I didn't have high expectations, but this movie fell into depths, I couldn't imagine. The plot, as it were, involved a priest of a unclear 2-member order examining the founder's death of the order of a Sin Eater. His Eater allows Catholics to obtain salvation beyond the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in films with lots of envy. Never mind that this has no meaning since then a Baptist could give you salvation .... we continue. <br /> <br /> I will prepare the plot without giving away much: The priest goes to Rome with his buddy to invest. He brings with him a mental patient (I do not open it) who shot him during an exorcism and who loves him (not such a parable is explained), a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as cardinal. They come to Rome, find some creepy children who do nothing in the movie, meet with a relative S & M anti-pope, that the drunk Irish guy knows (not explained) and who provides information by killing people (oh, BTW , he's a bad guy so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and so ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot dreams of. Heath chills with Sin Eater flies to New York with Sin Eater for an overnighter, and then some other things happen and then (all from camera) the anti-pope falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> In 1 hour in the movie you really wonder if something has happened. In the end, something has happened, but you can not be sure that it matters, and most of the drama happens, either before movei or off-scene you really feel cheated.
