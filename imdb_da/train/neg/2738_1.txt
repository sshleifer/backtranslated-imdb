Trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I find them comfortable. This one is so bad that I'm out of words to describe it - it's under "bad". There is an instruction at the beginning of the movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen beers couldn't help me put me in the whole movie. A tagliner compares this to KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Of course. This tagliner had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting this, put it down! If you are thinking of buying, do not believe! If you are unlucky to have this DVD, do not play it, immediately throw it in the trash.
