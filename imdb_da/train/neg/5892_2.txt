Ripper Ripper (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002) with hints of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but abominably made Gore (a green corpse with red eyes!) Weak story and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). There were two moments in this movie that made me shake, both involved an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, this one from 1999) made me whine for hours after seeing it, and everyone the movies this steals from were actually scary, i can't see this movie as anything but a sale to the western popularity of the great japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
