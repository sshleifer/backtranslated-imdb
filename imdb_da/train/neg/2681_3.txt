A very good story for a movie that, if done right, would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of that? <br /> The scenes zipper so fast that you felt you were not part of the movie emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the story. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast are questionable, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Have I missed the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I think we have to wait for the successor. <br /> <br />
