I am determined in the minority opinion on this. "Hurt Locker" has won more "Best Picture" prizes from critics than any other movie this year. But I didn't just like it, I found it hard to sit through. <br /> <br /> There is minimal plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm several bombs. It's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and constantly shakes. This has been a recent dish in film making, and it has to make it more real because it has a cheap, documentary look. The camera shook so much that it made me disgusted to look at the screen. I usually don't like war movies and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you don't have to take my word for it because the critics love it.
