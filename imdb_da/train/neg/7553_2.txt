A phenomenal achievement in horror. It is actually fun terribly. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Nicholas Cage has now made it to the finals of the Over-Emoting category in his acting class. By having new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times, his pointed ears seem to be strenuous to touch the back, he not only oozes a sick smarmy, but creates a "totally" character that you don't have some interest in. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes women completely different and evil ... and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all "b **** es" a couple of times too. I've enjoyed LaBute's early movie and a couple of his plays ... but it's a weird fascination he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 based solely on Ellen Burstyn's performance. At the time she finally carries out her appearance (brave soldiers through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead), it seems that all hope can be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now to say her lines with a straight face and when she looks at herself with a white mumu and blue, white and gold face paint that blooms on The Wicker Man, you know to work with scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her to this role dang well. <br /> <br /> This movie is so wrong and cuckoo to be seen as believed. The highlights include: Nicholas Cage runs away from a swarm of bees and then falls down a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bike and looks like Mrs. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz who is driving it. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage runs around the island kicking down the doors looking for the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMING from a once-promising career in a "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dances around in one said while mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage screamed "Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?" without reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear suit (I'm not funny) runs through the forest, takes off the costume (but leaves the bear's feet) and then karate goes to some villains. <br /> <br /> And you haven't lived until you've seen the last 15 minutes of the movie and its terrible epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can do it through this movie without laughing out loud, you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if it might not be a detailed send-up of "hysteria" movies ... only to be reminded of Cage's screaming / shouting / whispering dialogue that he really took quite seriously. <br /> <br /> I think one is destined to be a cult movie all the time again ... just because it's so terrible.
