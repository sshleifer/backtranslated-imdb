I watched this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I must be one of the perhaps twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I can't remember a whole lot of it, but I remember being incredibly boring, the plot had no meaning, and when I got out of the theater, the only thing I could say was at least now I know what the worst movie is I ever saw was. I was just disturbed by one thing: if they can make the temperature when they approach the sun, which is low enough for people to survive, why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we are?
