This movie was horrible. I swear they didn't even write a script, they just even wiggle it through the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * SPOILER Phht more as reasons not to see it * They sit and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have been far away. The soil was hard, it would be close to impossible to track him out with dogs. And when the ICE-T is on the Hill and uses the Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as its sniper rifle (and then cuts down a tree with eight shells? It would take thousands of shells to cut down a tree like size.) Shotguns and small arms are considered to be inaccurate in 100 years. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light ?? I didn't see an extent on that thing. Even when he was shot in the gut and kept walking, it was retarded, he would bleed to death right there. Plus, it ends where he jumps a stone or a cigarette into boys barrel. It wouldn't blow up and kill him. The ball will still guys kill ice, but clean up the barrel.
