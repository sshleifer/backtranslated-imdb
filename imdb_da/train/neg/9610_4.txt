In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make a Western, except Warner Bros. The few times they try, it's always ridiculous (except perhaps for the dead with their boots on - which is a western cavalry.) I've read that Humphrey Bogart, when he saw James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said that he resembles a mushroom. Right! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, for the twenty-first century to be credible in a Western movie. The story here had no surprise, and it didn't help. Every 10 minutes I expect to see Bogart and Cagney drop their little guns and put their hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930s black car.
