Being a fan of cheesy horror movies, I saw this in my video store and thought I'd give it a try. Now that I've seen it, I want it on no living soul on the planet. I get my movie rental for free, and I feel I haven't got my money's worth. I've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time, hell I'm a fan of them, but it was just an insult.
