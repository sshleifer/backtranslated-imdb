Well, first, if you check out the Zombies rebellion as a very early movie of the night of living death (1968), forget about it. This is about "zombies" in a more psychological sense, where this term simply refers to a person who does not have control over their will, but who must instead follow another's will. The "zombies" here, as little as they are in the movie, are largely metaphors for submitting the state or authority generally as in wartime. It is quite stretchy to call this a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is set during World War I. A "French Cambodian" contingent had heard strange stories of zombification - allegedly Angkor Wat was built by exploiting zombies - and there are stories of zombie armies that easily overcome enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back a priest who allegedly knows the secret of zombification, but he will not speak. So Louque and an international military contingent head to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to "wipe out the white race". <br /> <br /> One of the odd things about Zombies rebellion is that maybe author / director Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. The movie begins as if it wants to explore the zombie / military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after approx. 15 minutes changes that gear and becomes more of a love triangle story. <br /> <br /> Halperine stick with a subtitle of will and power (and a Nietzschean "will to power"). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editing are very choppy. This is yet another older movie that I would not be surprised if there are missing recordings, especially because some scenes even fall or are cut while a character is pronounced dialogue. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the ornate romance story, Halperin is trying to continue referring to the zombie thread, but a bit of the zoo material makes great sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but that doesn't mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusing. Halperin even resorts to using superimposed images of Bela Lugosis googly eyes from his 1932 movie, the White Zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. Promising, interesting characters from early wheels disappear for long periods. A potential villain is safely disposed of before he gets much to do. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of old creaking B movies, Zombies rebellion can be worth seeing at least once - the one is not that bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can Add an interesting story to your mind to fill in all the gaps. But this is the second time I've seen the movie, with the first one for approx. five years ago, and I could hardly remember anything about it - so it's not exactly memorable.
