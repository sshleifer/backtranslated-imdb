Another cult strikes again. This is not a spoiler, because the real ending comes after you have researched the people who brought this far too long, pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like screen of fraud, I go away. Thank you Ramtha I saw a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend" ... having wasted precious resources on this New Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe they can go to water" enough to take that guidance to the "logical" conclusion ... in other words; go, drown ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" on its entertainment value, especially to create the most eerie character in film history (photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek!). If you have to watch this movie, loan it from one of the brainwashed people who recommended it.
