Mind, my friends and I saw the movie based on it's title alone. It's cute, though it's obvious in the plot and direction - you know where the movie goes within the first five minutes. My main battle with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent, they never explain many things behind the signs. An alcoholic father, overtime mother, stressed sister ... it's a bad family, but apart from occasional mention from the sister there's no decision. I was also confused with the scene with the bottles ... it seemed pretty random. The scripture is a secondary concern ... the children were not bad actors, but their script was much to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a sweet niche movie could be pushed aside for a single, blah, special effect, lame scripting and a clear obvious plot.
