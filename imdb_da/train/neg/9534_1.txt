I'm a fan of the previous best of the best movies. But this one was horrible. No wonder I had such a hard time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found one with a copy of this movie. The action was horrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was also bad. <br /> <br /> I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme this movie had with the first 2 movies. <br /> <br /> John
