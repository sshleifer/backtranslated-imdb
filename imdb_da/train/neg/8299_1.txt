A Christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. So of course I was elated when this movie came out in 1994. I saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself. I came away Uprising and Digusted. The expectation, which is true in a Christmas story, is curiously missing from this mess. A red Ryder BB Gun is better to get than a Chinese top. And it's not much fun at all. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stops there. Bottom line: 1 star. Do not even disturb.
