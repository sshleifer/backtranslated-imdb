It was agonizingly bad movie. It will eat your heart out while you see it. I ask you: Don't watch this movie! You will hate losing 1.5 hours in your lifetime! It's not like some movies that are so bad you can see them and enjoy ... this movie is boring as ... there's nothing as boring as this movie. You will hate yourself after watching this movie at the end. And you will hate yourself that you did not listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and I finally saw this movie. Excuse me now, I'll shoot myself. I've seen everything. <br /> <br /> Please. Read this very carefully. Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
