While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells can be exciting, performance is quite pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start as I have so many problems with this movie. I suppose I only number a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. The play ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know you're in trouble? Not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly A-List names. Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I've never seen her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less the better said. <br /> <br /> 2. The Ghosts ?? The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me of a bit of the ghosts in the haunted palace. In Disney World. And they are almost as scary. And why should they be so obvious? Subtle is not a hallmark of The House Where Evil Dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can a movie be? The result of this movie is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If you could not see where this movie was led after approx. 15 minutes, watch more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The Practical Priest ?? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just goes across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows your home story and comes over, knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think about something positive to write about. I assume I will give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture. It is a sure sign of a winner ?? Noting the architecture as a highlight of any movie doesn't say much about the actual movie. <br /> <br /> I stop. You must be able to get the idea from what I have already mentioned. And I haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a whole host of other issues. Be warned, this thing is terrible.
