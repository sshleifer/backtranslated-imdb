I want to be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler's (especially from Early Edition). As he usually plays the good guy, I would see him as in another role (out of curiosity). The plot itself took me too; a will-hitman (Tony Greco-a.c. Mr. Chandler) must strike a person randomly before he trusts in life - or rather death - of a witness who will testify to someone in the "family". The movies were nothing as expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why) and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically - it was filthy and didn't make any sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes, the guns are bound. But there's more to a movie than that. This movie acted like it didn't have time to go into detail - just handle it and understand it. The action really worked out - James Belushi was pretty entertaining as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel be as trustworthy as she could. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was as convincing as a nervous newcomer to the "family". If only the script was right for the actors.
