Terrible play, horrible cast and cheap props. Would have been much better if it was set as an action parody movie. What a waste. Starting from the movie's name. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy", which names it "Action Movie", would have done better. (contributes to the parody effect). The manager looks like a 60-year-old player, the blonde girl has just the same gentle boring look on her face all the time. Towards the end of the film, he and her work together to shut down the evil guys, and every time they exchange words, it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Terrible. Do not waste your time.
