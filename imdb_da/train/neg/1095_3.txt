I saw this a few days ago so details become lazy. The film is shot on handheld cameras, and much was made of this at the time it was originally released, as we hadn't had many studio pictures made this way. I can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything designed to get the audience to think that what we see on the screen has not had all the compromises that come with a big budget and that was also more ". But what we have here is not much more than a not-so-good rip off of the first half of the Full Metal Jacket, so anyone who has seen it or one of the other rip offs there of, want to know what to expect The biggest problem I had was the stereotypical characters, with the soft children out of their depth, close harmony song, ebonics spouting black dudes, the world's tired sergeants, bitter and twisted psychos etc etc ... Everything is put in the various situations that would give the most friction and excitement at any time, perhaps it was appropriate to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, perhaps it was laziness, or perhaps it was just a committee that tried to appeal to the largest audience, all I know was, they t was annoying, a new thing was the mix of volunteers and draftees (where usually all the characters should have been forced into the situation), although only the scenes between the two protagonists really do much of it. This seems to be the most important pivot of the plot, with the volunteers coming to their senses and draftees getting a sense of duty and self-esteem, but all done in a fairly forced and unbridled way. The other big mistake I had was how all the characters (with the exception of the psychoses and the real softies) would react to every inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence facing Farrell's ubiquitous stoicism, immediately down and all reasonable and diplomatic. <br /> <br /> I think if I were to find a plus, it would be to act from the two leaders, which was strong and very convincing, considering the characteristic characters of the characters, was it not It's not too hard. <br /> <br /> In my imagination, Bozz grew up to Zeke off the Tour of Duty, and for my money, 4 episodes would be more fun to watch.
