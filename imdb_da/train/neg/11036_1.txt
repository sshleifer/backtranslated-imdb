It should be the most corniest television show in the air. This is another escape to Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent out, he younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and never spoken again except in a negative use. Jim has to retire or something. Let them go in the air. If I here a joke from that show I will throw up and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. Id is rather taken from the devil himself than see a whole half hour of piece programming. I still don't understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deeply that we will shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more, thank you.
