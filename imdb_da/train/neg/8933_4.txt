Watching this night, it surprised me that Fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment. This is the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed. I'm sure the first morning of the movie Raquel Welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a seat for the Academy Award she would surely win for this bold original movie. Oops. That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The effort on the set was described in the print of Rex Reed, and this helped the movie to achieve a reputation before it was even released. When it was finally released, there was not the usual three ring circus of advertising. If I remember correctly, in Houston it opened at the drive-in and neighborhood theaters and never played any of the major venues. I made most of the blame on director Michael Sarne, who was warm after directing (it's not so good) JOANNA, a film of music about young people swinging towards London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox lifted the film together and linked the best they could. Therefore, scenes play in no particular order, and characters then appear and disappear. An impressive support cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To extend it to length, there are many clips from Fox movie stars like Carmen Miranda (in amazing footage from GANG'S WHOLE HERE) and Laurel and Hardy who never dreamed they would play in an X-rated movie. The X-score is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions; But none of the characters seem to have fun. Maybe someone was involved in the movie, a spoiled Puritan sensitivity, and figured that if they could make these things unpleasant, exploiting them was not bad. <br /> <br /> This was one of the "youth images" that almost went bankrupt Hollywood in the 1970s. An author shot that the EASY RIDER (which was made for pocket change) was the most expensive movie ever made because of so many movies trying and failing in the worst way to duplicate its success. Sixtyish, once honored instructors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger made films like RPM and SKIDOO in an attempt to attract a young audience. White directors and writers tried to make movies to attract a black audience. These movies are locked somewhere in a vault, and the two named and many others from that genre have never, as I know, ever been home video or cable. They are the deep, dark secret of the studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in this is all very well considered. With the right direction and scripts, she could play the kind of sassy liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialize in. She looks great and has great costumes. Mae West is the liveliest seventy-one actress I've ever seen. On the one hand it is kind of heartbreaking to see her attempts to capture her glory from year to year, but I am sure she needs the money. <br /> <br /> To see a big budget X-rated movie from this era check out below the valleys (also from Fox) because it doesn't take itself seriously. It is crazy children playing with the equipment on a large study. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is trying to say something. There just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen.
