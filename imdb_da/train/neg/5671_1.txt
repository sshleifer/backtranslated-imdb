If you like to see the animals shining alive, crushed their heads, the dog's throats are crushed, my men stumble upon them, then this is for you! But if you are something normal and don't have to see real recordings of animal abuse, send this one up. This movie is trying to shock the viewer, and it does. With the animal nuisance in the beginning and killing babies in the movie (fake at least), it was enough to make me turn it off. I've seen movies like this before it shows slaughterhouse recordings (BTK movies) and this kind of recordings shouldn't be allowed in a horror movie. watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, that's not what we rented the movie for. If anything, there must be a big warning label on these types of garbage games so people won; Don't be surprised. As a very hardcore horror fan, this turned me my stomach. The entire film casting and crew need their heads checked.
