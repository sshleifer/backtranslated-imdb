Hood of the Living Dead is about a young researcher named Rick, who lives with his brother in the city of Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother gets shot by a gang that runs down the street fighting with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls his scientist partner to bring the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on a human or even a dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. He gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911, and the body is just waving away to come back to life and feast on human flesh. Now Rick has to find his zombie brother before the whole hood is turned into a dead neighborhood. The hood of the living dead is a piece of trash can. The reason is a direct rip off Resident Evil, the play is just awful, especially with Rick's fake crying for his brother, the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired, it emits sparks and the makeup is just lame. It is only false blood covered by the actors face. The zombies are also changing. They run, ditches and must be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only scuffle, moan and be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so horrible, outtakes are the only true good moment in this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there, but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe party.
