Serge Farnel made a very precise critique of this movie in review "The Rwandese Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> A critic showing how France was behind all the situations that the UN had undergone in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten UN soldiers were killed by the genocide forces. That is why the UN soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the French trucks. <br /> <br /> By doing so, they gave up the Tutsis, which are unforgivable of course. <br /> <br /> But we must remember that the French soldiers organized this situation.
