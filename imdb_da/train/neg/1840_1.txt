This must be the most brutally unfunny "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a Galician Homeless Can't Make Me Laugh? Something has to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt like going out. I used free passes and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can wholeheartedly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very little at the merry round scene, and that's it. Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than a laugh, right? I don't know that the filmmakers thought the "flan" was a funny word or something. And the other running joke really strikes a dead horse - literally.
