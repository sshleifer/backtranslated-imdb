In the light of the recent and pretty good Batman the Brave and the Bold, it's time to take a fatal blow to that mistake in Batman's life. Being a big fan since the first revival of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I have been able to accept various tonalities in character, darkness or campy. This one is just not credible: too many effects, bad intrigues and so few questions. What is good about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only in his karate days. And by the way, how is the Penguin capable of such virtuosity when he jumps in the air, regardless of his portly corpulence? And look at Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man, which Batman fan could accept such a betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is much better without "The" article in front of his name.
