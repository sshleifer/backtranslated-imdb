There is nothing I hate more than self-explanatory pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails to inspire all the white middle classes to make a movie about why they can't be laid. I don't mind the inexperience and low budget production, but when writing is so obvious and cloying, it really burns my potatoes. The money in this could have gone to a really fighting filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you see Project Greenlight, you immediately recognize a talented visionary fighting the system. Anyone could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that failed to say anything real. When will we be saved from Smithonites and Whedonettes in the world? The revolution cannot come soon enough. Go see a real first-time effort by buying Desperado or seeking friends with benefits. Thanks and hello.
