An interesting idea for a movie that both shows the last dragon on earth and shows the struggle he and an evil have together. When he was younger, Einon stuck in his heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark gentleman who gave him half of his heart. Now adult Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend Draco the Dragon (pronounced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for "killing" dragons. But because Einon hears half of Dracos, they both feel that the pain in one of them is hurt or killed. Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. It was nominated for Oscar for best visual effects. Worth to see!
