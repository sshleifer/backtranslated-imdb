If you really want to spend two hours in your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Browse the TV listings. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When 'Men in White' comes on, look and see. <br /> <br /> And that's it. Having sat through two hours of bad saying, terrible (and not so funny) movie references and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ​​ever made in recent history, you'll have wasted two hours in your life and wonder exactly why. <br /> <br /> Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this movie might actually be good. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you can see some famous faces during the movie. Probably to save on production costs, Saban (who also produces Power Rangers) decided to spray old monster suits from everyone's favorite sticky toy franchise throughout the movie. I saw some old monsters from episodes that I saw when I was a child, so I think it could at least be said to have some nostalgic value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the actual Power Rangers monsters, see the Power Rangers themselves. It is much better than this piece of waste. (And that says something!)
