My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Certainly in the top ten of them I've seen all the way through. At least "Plan 9" was fun. I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other movies. I didn't care about "Cujo" (only because the sound was so bad on versions I've seen and I couldn't often tell what people were saying) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in every possible way. The "beings" themselves seemed to be designed by a 9-year-old. (No offense to 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even "one-liners" made us moan and were not extremely funny.
