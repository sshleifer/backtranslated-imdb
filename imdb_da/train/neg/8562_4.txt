CAMILLE 2000 <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono While visiting Rome, an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine ( Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is contradicted by Castelnuovo's rich father (Massimo Serato), and fate has a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> A sexy up love story for the swinging 60s, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas' 'La Dame aux Camelias') by scriptwriter Michael DeForrest and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno also credited with redefining the parameters of' Adult 'cinema throughout the 1960s and the 70s. Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' uses the format of the last time in his career, and it is abundant in visual surplus (note the weight of reflective surfaces, for example), although the sexual desire of the film seems alarmingly coy to modern standards. Production values ​​are beautiful all the way through and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), in spite of weak sync. While there is an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out design finds its place in its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult object among exploiters. In the end, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica are not disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider their best movie.
