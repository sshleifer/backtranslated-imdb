This movie kind of reminds me of a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie-only worse. Just the rich sisters kind of thing, I think, although Alyson's more actor, in this movie Amanda Michalka was okay sometimes, but Alyson's worked stunk. I think after high school musical they needed to get up somethihng better and that certainly wasn't. The story wasn't that great, and I think they should have made two other people play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie didn't make me better for her. I think they should definitely be sick of singing and only watching this movie if you have nothing better to do (unfortunately I didn't)
