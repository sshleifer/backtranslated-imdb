First of all, I believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the boring emotional films of the 70s and 80s, movies from this place actually began to contain some humor. Imagine .. Actual comedies were made! Movies were actually beginning to be entertaining and fun, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring. During the 90s and 00s, several really great films were made by a 'new generation' filmmakers. Movies by movie were praised by critics and played lots of money. It was the norm! <br /> <br /> So came United ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's simply not fun. Not even. Never ever. But the thing is ... We think it's fun. Because we are used to Norwegian movies being fun. Especially with a throw like this with some really funny comedians. But .. They don't say or do anything fun! Where is humor? Show me humor! Is it the monstrous clerk played by Harald Eia? Is it the exaggerated, completely ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Is that the comment from Arne Scheie? The movie is just not fun! <br /> <br /> But it's not my main rant about United. It is the predictability. (And this is where I'm afraid Norwegian comedies have stopped, since I've also seen this in many other movies.) All the time, you just know it's going to end well. All characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve at the end. There is absolutely no room for surprises at all! <br /> <br /> All in all, I was feeling a bad feeling after watching this movie. It was the only movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in Norwegian film production ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
