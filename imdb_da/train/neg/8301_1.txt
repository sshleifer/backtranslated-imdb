Really bad. Why anyone thinks this is a good movie or even fun is a true mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man, and I LOVED "A Christmas story." The fact that it has the same director and was based on the same author's memoirs, has completely confused me why this film is so complete failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is violently mistaken as the father of starters. For another, it does not seem to have the same pacing - it just doesn't flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life, which permeated the first film, is completely absent here - you just want the movie to end. I would not even recommend this movie to curiosity seekers who enjoy "A Christmas Story." It's so bad. 10.1.
