"Don't see this movie" would be better advised if you like Marilyn Monroe in his other roles. This was a huge disappointment considering the big roll, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just nothing, certainly not as described on the VHS box, of course. There was simply no excitement, precious excitement and too many dull spots, most of them tried to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so shaken up. This was not a good role for Monroe, although I didn't need to see this character knowing she could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was enough proof for me. But this role just doesn't suit her, and it's not surprising, it wasn't one of her more popular films. It's also bad that a movie has wasted the talents of actors such as Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisa Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.
