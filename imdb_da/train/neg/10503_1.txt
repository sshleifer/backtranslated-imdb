I watched this movie yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact, I know one of the actresses from the movie .. I don't want to say who ..! (It is kept under wraps ..) But I have to admit it wasn't as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? Hats down to this guy. But it's a pity he wasn't in the movie for a long time. What the movie lacks is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. It may look like a good movie .. but it wasn't It is entertaining .. I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 to rent 3 DVDs from Blockbuster. I chose this one .. and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
