Thin history relates to two small-town brothers and their struggles for family honor. David Morse is the responsible, straight-laced policeman and 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, the "bad" boy, is a former soldier and former judge. As an actor (especially in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method. Turning to the first-time writer and director of this artificial, unstable drama, he works out his script and characters through the same methodical process, lowering the pacing down to a creep (apparently so we can capture every nuance and bend). This approach can be fascinating if there were three-dimensional signs to worry about, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as siblings. Worse, we expect more from prominent picture veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get the chance to get through with anything interesting. The picture is balky with turgid sequences, a wobble story and confusing editing (always oblique to point to the artistic profits). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but they are mostly an annoyance. * 1/2 from ****
