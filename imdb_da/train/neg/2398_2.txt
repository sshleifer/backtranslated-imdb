Being a fan of movies like "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane", I saw this because it was mentioned positively in connection with real comedies and satires as the aforementioned. Well, wrong conclusion! <br /> <br /> Not only is this not fun, it makes you angry because it is not bad in a shy, sympathetic way, but in a really bad way. It's bad-bad. The scripture does not contain a single fun line that is right in the way when trying to entertain your audience with humor. Adam Arkin's speech disorder is probably the most annoying thing about this movie. Nevertheless, this cruelty in nature prevents him from being smuggled through the entire movie, and he has difficulty looking at the camera. This amateur without charisma fits well with the constant continuity errors and bumbles along the story - if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a couple of Leno movies, and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good though. In the few lines he has given. I'm not easily scared of bad comedies, so I continued to look and look for all the quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so. The film actually becomes a comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he literally does: From 75 minutes into the movie, he is in every scene. But it's too little late. When movies try to trick you into believing that their lack of professionalism is the reason why you should like them because they have the right intentions, they remind me of students who have not prepared for the exam. In these cases, you must remain strict and the character must be an 'F'. (But please assume that I am a teacher. It is a profession with respectability somewhere between the politician and the nanny). <br /> <br /> If you are actually searching for a similarly watched horror / scifi movie that is fun to watch and contains jokes, try "Man with the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or watch the Sunshine / Core if you prefer modern high-tech SciFi Schlock. It's just as fun, though involuntary.
