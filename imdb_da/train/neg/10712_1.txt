This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I ever stress, ever made. What's worse, my old hero Dolph is in it and he stares at it. Jesus ... The story is actually quite good, but the way it is done, my body also hurt. The battle sequences for starters are also just choreographed as a battle between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter. The actors, with the exception of Dolph, who also hurt, perform so badly that you can't help but wonder if their reason to be there is that they are all friends of the director who, incidentally, must have been absent most , if not all the time. It is 12 million kroner spent in an unthinkable way, because the cost and appearance cannot cost more than ยง1000.
