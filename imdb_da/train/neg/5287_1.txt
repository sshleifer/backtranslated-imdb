I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" as they already had the fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to make a feature length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; Unfortunately, what ended up in the floor room was all the lovely white and humor that left a movie that was simply melodrama rather than a fun showcase of English countrymen and morers. Also the signs were low and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth as a silly modern teenager (and if you happen to be a silly modern teenager reading this, let me tell you: running for a man like a woman in heat is not cool ). It is something that a well-bred woman in the Napoleon era would never have done, and certainly not this head heroine. Some have said they found this antic ridiculous; my reaction was not laughter but rebellion. The very idea of ​​such a corruption in an Austen work is under contempt. <br /> <br /> It was terrible.
