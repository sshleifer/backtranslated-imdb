If you loved "Pulp Fiction" and like handheld cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the quirky story (although I feel that "Pulp Fiction" was the most overrated movie since "The English Patient") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and is the burden of European pretentiousness. But the worst part is by far the handheld camera. It's so distracting and annoying that I myself desperately waited for the movie to end. I don't know why new directors think this movie method is so great. If you are prone to exercise sickness, stay away, the handheld camera will make you feel sick for about 10 minutes.
