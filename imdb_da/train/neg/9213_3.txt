I captured this movie at a small screening held by members of my college play club. We were warned that this would be "reefer madness" of games and this movie more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man resumes his college career after "resting" for a semester. What we viewer looks like the movie is progressing is that Robbie was hopelessly dependent on a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game that he is recognized with after a game group has recruited him for a campaign. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous on many, many levels. One scene has the group "candle games", which is probably the best way I can describe it. Although I'm sure this was supposed to be "cool" in some way that most players know, it's terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions take place in well-lit spaces, usually over some chee-tohs and a can. <br /> <br /> The act, but not the Oscar caliber, is not gut-wrenchingly horrible either. This is one of Tom Hank's first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon. The supportive cast, while not very memorable, still portrays decent performances. The main reason is the badness of being a television movie showing "the dangers of gaming". Worth to see if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
