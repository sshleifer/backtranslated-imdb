Much has been done by Rohmer's use of digital technology to "fill in" the background. At times it works well, the scene where Grace and her girls witness from the king's performance is particularly striking. At other times, it gives the film a strange amateur look that resembles a home video. The biggest shortcoming, however, is that the sheer artificiality of mise a scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer. We know that what we see is not true, how can we feel the signs? To be honest, I didn't care at all about what happened to the lady or the duke. <br /> <br /> The other major failing I regret to say is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role. She is in virtually all scenes, and the film's success or otherwise rests on her performance. OK she speaks a foreign language, but she is unable to express true feeling. Her feelings in the scene where she tells her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by debut Helena Dubiel) to see the head of a pole caused some embarrassing laughter in the audience. See also her hands when expressing emotions! All in all, a very disappointing movie, especially considering the positive reviews on this site.
