So they hyped the violence and it has been labeled as sick. Well, the violence is the best bit I'm afraid of, but unfortunately, the characters aren't enough to let us understand why they go on their (totally predictable) rampage. This movie has a really terrible script. We never get the chance to get to know Robert and his actions at the end are just pathetic. The play is not much better, either the worst is the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep. And what on earth is the school film project about? A comment on the movie itself? The use of news stories under the climatic murder is ridiculous. Of course, these guys believe they are intellectual, but are hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth did they make the great Yorgos Arvanitis shine on what I will never know. And how they made the money do it in the first place is an even greater mystery. Absolutely horrible beyond understanding.
