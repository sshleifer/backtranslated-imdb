Rodney Dangerfield is not the protagonist of this movie. He's right in it. Most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes. One ongoing gag is that a character is called Jerk Off. There are also plenty of erection jokes where the stroke line is someone has an erection. This movie is as fun as Kirstie Alice's British accent is convincing. <br /> <br /> This movie started out as a weak action movie: five minutes behind history and then bam! Involuntary jokes. But apart from the horrible writing, the film is also badly corrected and the play is terrible. Also this film makes the old bad comedy clich√© about having lots of well-known B movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, even though he is considered the main character. Don't be surprised to find this movie at a pharmacy selling five bucks. Even that is too much.
