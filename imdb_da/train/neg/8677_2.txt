I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I figured hey no matter how stupid this movie would be, at least I saw him kick some ass, didn't he? Wrong. This is a boring, boring mess of meaningless talking, half-written script writing and meaningless twilight. There are few action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are shot and edited so badly that you can't even figure out what's in the world. The dice are also horrible, and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly has the Italian Mafia ... except those are all Japanese! Avoid like the plague - you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes.
