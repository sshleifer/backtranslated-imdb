It is possible that A Man Called Sledge could have done irreparable damage to the cutting room floor. Maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to deposit into the spaghetti western market and thus brought a lot of Americans over to fill out the cast. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow, who both wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> Yarns are always thrown like lying rogues because he saw darn good at playing them. But he has played seriously and done well in movies like The Children's Hour and Gun's Hour. He can and has successfully broken away from his usual stereotypical part. But a man called sledge cannot be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the title role as Luther Sledge's infamous crime at a great price. After partner Tony Young is killed in a salon, and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style action, he is followed from the salon by John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley's time spent in the nearby territorial prison, and it seems that gold shipments are under lock and key there on a rest stop for people carrying things on a regular basis. Garner gets his gang together for a hoist. <br /> <br /> Here is the film completely away from the wall. Normally heist film shows the protagonists going in a lot of methodical planning. It was certainly the case in The War Wagon, as another reviewer quoted. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a prison of the fake American Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. <br /> <br /> It was just too much to swallow. If it was so easy to take the gold, it should have been done long before. But I want to say to those who like the blood and intestines of Italian westerns, during the prison break, there are probably three movies there. <br /> <br /> It's not all, of course they are banned and we have another gore party before the movie ends. But at that time the whole movie has lost a lot of connection. <br /> <br /> The big movie singer of Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for my life I can't find him in the movie. Maybe a choir of Donkey Serenade might have done better. <br /> <br /> Couldn't have hurt anyone.
