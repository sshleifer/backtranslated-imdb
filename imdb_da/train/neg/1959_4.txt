The gum is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that entices the children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then take their lives. The first few minutes introduce you to the beginning of the legend of the tooth foot in 1949 and then change to the present day. The worn-out horror plot is largely rescued by the regular play. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but in general the scenes were bloody, but quick, which had a minimizing effect. The eye candy is pretty good for both sexes. Camera work is good. Dialogue is fair, but cheesy. I expected the movie to be a bare bones, low budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised at the quality of the movie.
