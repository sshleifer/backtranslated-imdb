Paint by speech history and mediocre action hidden by a true color - and a few moments that are truly wonderful and deeply felt. It effectively captures a sweet transition from a girl to adulthood, and acts very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict as the main family experiences. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in a speechless and extremely enveloped plot capable of incorporating religious strife, a road construction conflict, secondary and even tertiary character sex life, a mysterious man living in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the complicated of local church politics, and about and over and over. And all this does not even include the true central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized that whole things were going to happen during a summer (and so much movie was achieved in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, big life-changing events happen and then forgotten about. 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. Most shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a completely predictable "twist") and is completely forgiven and the whole incident is forgotten from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a few minutes later and give another "twist". It is completely mechanical, right up to the end, that binds all the loose ends together well (not all of them, just the ones that the movie thinks you are interested in.)
