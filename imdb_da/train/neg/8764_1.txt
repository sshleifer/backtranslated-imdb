This movie was absolute torture. First of all, it's a huge 4+ hour long! True, the Kargil war may have had several points caught and fought for, but each of these battles does not have to be shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial movie as advertised. Sure it didn't look like it, since no background information was provided and there were some errors. The fighting sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed by the man who gave well executed sequences in the border. Each stroke was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This can be a spoiler.) The whole army marches uphill, five or so soldiers forbid five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword each time), one of the leading actors is shot, some cry for a hangover, The actor says, "No, don't take a hanger. It will take 6 men from the battalion," and then an actor dies. Exactly the same thing happens again and again and again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The film is too big for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters were well developed. The actors had the smallest roles. They are all dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them cried synchronously. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads at exactly the same time and then brought their dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on again. I know I still forget something. At least I think I have based the film enough to get the picture.
