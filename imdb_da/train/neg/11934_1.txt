I sat through almost an episode of this series and just couldn't take more. It felt like I had seen dozens of episodes already, and then it hit me ..... There's nothing new here! I've heard the joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like this on friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same story, ect. None of the actors here is also interesting! Some were good at other shows (not here) and others are new to a profession they should never have entered. Avoid this stink!
