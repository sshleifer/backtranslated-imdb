I have not yet read a negative review of this film. I must have missed something. The beginning is exciting, the three main characters meet late in the evening in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. That's the best part. After the three go their separate ways splitting the movie into three threads. That's when boredom gets in. Admittedly, the thread with the fellinic babushkas that make popping out of chewed bread is initially an eye-opening curiosity. Unfortunately, the director has turned this to death, even injecting a wild plot line that doesn't go anywhere. Bottom line: a two-hour plot-thin listlessness. If you suffer from insomnia, see it in bed, and you want a good night's sleep.
