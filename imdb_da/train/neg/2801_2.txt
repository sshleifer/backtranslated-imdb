After a quasi-Gothic, all-fruity music video, the film starts with Cassidy, which the leader's singing kills himself. In a perfect world it would be, and in the end credits would roll. We do not live that world. The effortless band members decide to go to some clown to contact their dead essence. When I say clown, I really mean clown. He tells them that they are all going to die via Cassidy's ghost (the spirit holds Dora, one of the bandits). We couldn't break less as the signs are all boring, wet and extremely awful. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredible surname if ever there) and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who, after the companion and the blood tower, must know that he continues to shame), this film is a constant battle between the movie's incompetence and viewers need to stay awake. Not enough blood to pamper gorehounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs. This movie actually has absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway becomes topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
