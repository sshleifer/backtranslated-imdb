WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should break, also sorry caps). Beginning with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that is even more annoying to talk nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. It's bad, but exactly set. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. There is a complicated system with great potential for malfunction, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc. And unexpected things have to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things were going wrong. It's called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 was not safe in today's standards, and there was tremendous political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. <br/> <br /> Miscellaneous Errors / Comments I hadn't even looked up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech if something went wrong. Oh, duh. That was what I would have done. It was the top of a propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives a green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 is likely to burst. (However, this is only "implicit"). Yes, that's why they leave people and pressure on the clock in almost real time. <br /> <br /> 3) The capsule ejection would not work. Just as it didn't work when a chimpanzee was in it. Who survived? It was a test start, and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with parachute. There is a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) An interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair share of Florida. I can only assume that it was supposed to be a hyperbolt, because if not, I'm just horrified at how he could get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology was so primitive to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware are used, even today, because the reason is that it must not collide. It is even worse for spacecraft because their computers have to be built of comparatively large components that are not as susceptible to radiation. (And the craft itself must still be controlled manually, so a complex operating system like the B2s would not do.) What is it that they use "TV screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same damned technology. In fact, TV screens were produced with a significantly higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If the object wasn't part of the rocket, it could only be one thing." We see where this goes. Except that the statement is wrong, who says it wasn't a rocket part? At least one interviewee cleans up that if one thing is flying and you don't know what it is, it is per. Definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) The voice transmission and some misquotes make it look as if the farmer's radiation foil was actually his hull. Which would make it thinner than a dress. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong is near death during an exercise flight, it's pictures I can appreciate; I hadn't seen it before. As I said, any piece of obvious technology can go wrong, especially if it is not adequately tested because of being, you know, without hitherto. 9) The pathway of the deviating country (due to irregularities in the lunar density) was in no time life-threatening. There was also no "fifteen seconds of fuel left" which was actually "fifteen seconds of fuel left before one had to interrupt the mission and return to the command module". <br /> <br /> 10) A catastrophic chain of events "usually results in disaster. I really don't know how to make it easier. However, this is an excellent example of the rhetoric. <br /> <br / > 11) There is a short order of one of the astronauts who go jumping around aimlessly as a happy child, followed by voice-over telling us that the cause of this strange behavior "can now be revealed". walked around hopelessly like a happy child. Hilarious stuff. <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that during re-entry all contact was lost, this is a completely natural phenomenon and it was so known at that time as it is impossible to bypass modern technology, again gravity is implicit, but much on purpose. <br /> <br /> 13) There was never a shuttle in the room, while the voice-over presents this "fact" as proof that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap, Appollo 13 was an almost loss, but the two worked even disasters occurred during liftoff and re-entry respectively. In any case, comparing pendulum boxes to Saturn rockets is somehow ... okay, just simple stupid. While ignoring it, the successful shuttle missions do not seem to be of interest to the public. <br /> <br /> 14) What the hell is that with UFO? Even in connection with the movie, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment, targeting a particular audience (which seems to include people with almost no understanding of either history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the point in the movie is somewhat unclear. Catch phrases like "covered up to now", "published here for the first time" come up, but the film does not blame or offer a lesson or something that one might expect from a movie so emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interviews and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people we do not know about, except "NASA researcher". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before efforts? Fancy it. What does this have to do with the point in the movie again? Oh yes, which point. <br /> <br /> In summary, in addition to being either intentionally or incompetently inaccurate, it's not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his crazy documentary; This movie is not funny, witty, picturesque, it is nothing.
