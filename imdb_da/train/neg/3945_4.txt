My name is Modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of Modesty Blaise's origins. It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just not what I expected or hoped for. Although I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not too familiar with the comics or the graphic novels, so I get into this movie as something like an outsider. It may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The movie is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name Modesty is a fatal serial movie. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. The action, at least from the Alexandra City, is acceptable, but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she seems a little too weak to be completely credible in the title role. Which action scenes are in My Name's Modesty is one of the movie's weakest points. I have never bought into the opinion that this woman could handle a band of trained kills. I really hope Quentin Tarantino is advancing and making rumors of a large budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I am convinced that the concept has many options, and I look very much forward to it.
