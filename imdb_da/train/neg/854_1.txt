Ladies and gentlemen, don't be fooled by the "A Stanley Kubrick" movie tag. This is a very bad movie, which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror movies ever made. Cunning films should create such a fear that in nights people should shake their hearts out while thinking of a true horror movie. In Shining there is no real horror at all, but what we find instead is just a naive, foolish attempt to create chilling horror. Everyone knows how good the trials are if they differ from reality. All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel, where most of the actors were filed, also seems good. A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul who is never quite sure what to do. There is not much to say about a bald, colored actor who, in most cases, is busy pampering a children's actor. No one has to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. It cannot be avoided when the film is made, and poor Kubrick does not live to make changes.
