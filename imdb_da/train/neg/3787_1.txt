I must be the one guy in America who didn't like this movie. I suppose this just wasn't my style or something, I just can't see what's so fascinating about what it was * hardly entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in movie history. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who came from nothing and continues to become a master of matter. Really simple way to describe a whole movie, and that is precisely my feeling of the whole movie. Contrary to popular belief, just because a movie is about mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups, it doesn't automatically make a good movie, don't forget good storytelling.
