I didn't see the whole movie. I couldn't see the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour, and I suggest someone thinks about seeing it, it stops itself before they take the disk out of the case. I like Mafia movies both tragically and cartoonly, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. The problem is Corky Romano is simply trying too hard to make the audience laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky herself is completely overplayed and lacks ease or credibility - all his strange ways come across as constructed - Chris Kattan is clearly 'acting' rather than playing a role - it just jumps you out of the story. Each scene is completely predictable, the "comic event" that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies like Mr. Bean is the disaster caused by title character, funny because you can empathize with the character's motivations and initial event, and the situation that character ends in is not telegraphed. However, Corky gives the impression that he deliberately turns up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris hadn't played such a strange character (who never really connects with the other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is totally inexplicable (except trying to draw laughs) and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed too familiar) this movie could be visible. But it is not. Don't look at it.
