The plot is about a woman nurse named Anna, caught in the midst of a worldwide chaos, as carnivorous zombies begin to rise and take over the world and attack the living. She escapes in the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like seeing a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a mall with more spirits. The heroes who have locked themselves in the mall to avoid being eaten by hoodlums outside are also no better. Although they do not appear to be full, they give the impression of being mentally handicapped. Save your money instead of spending it on this!
