DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie fans; This barely 80-minute film-making travesty contains everything hecklers can ask for - non-existent plotting, horrible appearances (spades for at least a raspy-sounding old lady), ridiculous scripting and schlock editing, and bargain basement style background settings . There are no signs that come across as pleasurable or interesting (especially the leader has nothing appealing about him), and the actors gathered almost nothing to rise above the F-class material. If that's not enough, then what about the lack of a compelling plot (like this movie has no such thing) to make DEATHSTALKER qualified as a great turkey? I was also offended that the women in this movie hardly serve any purpose other than to 1) be topless and / or wisely dressed; 2) get raped 3) have sex with the hero 4) all of the above. In addition, the background music is outrageous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy corkscrew and blaring orchestra Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one filled with Nary one thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited to people who are looking for something to laugh at (and believe me is lots of it in here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this 100th grade CONAN that you want to be the least.
