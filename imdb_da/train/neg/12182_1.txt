Well where do I start? I think it's very offensive to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie and I was expecting to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! The play is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, I am now 25 and Annie is still one of my favorite films, so I was very excited to see Annie 2. The act was horrible in the movie, was any of the letters original? very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie I want to see again, and any Annie lover, I love that you do not see this movie because it will only leave you very disappointed. The young girls singing is not bad, but still does not compare with the original
