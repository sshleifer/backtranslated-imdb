Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He's a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick ... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials on TV, I remember one where Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like a Nachos commercial: bad story, poor management and horrible beliefs. I can't believe a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Bad Oscar ... Nacho could make this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman who was very well connected with Spanish TV businessmen.
