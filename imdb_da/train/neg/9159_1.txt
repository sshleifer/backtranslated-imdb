If an author gives 2 points before the main title and about 15 more points before the movie starts, and the first shot shows that the author rolls around on a bed in lycra bike shorts, it will not be a surprise to observe that said author has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of look that might be useful for a gay aversion therapist. <br /> <br /> Others have given this thing the dishing it deserves. For me, the most pitiable moment was when the journey from LA was signified by a plane landing on what seemed to be LAX; and the return was indicated by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane.
