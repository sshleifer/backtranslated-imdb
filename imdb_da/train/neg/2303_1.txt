Unless people seem to buy into this garbage! Showing as "Moral Orel" has shown, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, over-the-top parody of evangelism you might think of, it would not come close to the hilarity of this show. It's hard to tell what even happens when you see it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start by reporting on various international news stories, but at seemingly random points, the news of this odd, troll-like little man with a forehead larger than his whole face is muttering, mumbling and laughing and generally scary. <Br /> Pat Robertson doesn't even think such a bad guy at first sight. He just seems like a senile, but harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for a murder that has befriended and offered help to not one, but two murderous dictators who have illegally used the donation money to run diamond mines that have supported forced abortion in China and which regularly entail that the Caucasians (especially American American Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> Still, everything will be fun, except that he apparently has a big enough fan base to keep his little show on air 40 years later (either that or enough money to bribe some TV leaders, that doesn't give a surprise what they show). The vision of the vision becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, have to look at it and hang on to every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people are still listening to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy mix of both.
