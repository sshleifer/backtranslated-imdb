wow! I saw the trailer for this one and even though 'nah, this is not for me'. I saw my husband and friend's faces under the trailer and knew it was a "boy movie". I mean, hi! a bunch of chick barmaids dancing - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started to see it, it didn't look that much. so I continued to see. I saw it right to the end. what a great movie. If that's something, it's a chick-flick. These girls have attitude. It's really a good movie, and a bit of a love story. really leaves you feeling good. In fact, the story of a small town that makes it big in the city, after reviewing the usual metropolis c ** p. There have been a few of these, it is almost a new city legend. But it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. Well, anyway. I think it is because the whole work of a bar scenario is very familiar, not just to me, but to many people I know. Don't believe in the trailers for this - it aims to bring in the men.
