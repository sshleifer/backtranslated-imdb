This is a movie that shows that mood and music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Sure the viewer is treated to many fine scenes in Los Angeles in the thirties - I especially liked the view of the wagon approaching the tunnel, and the tram rises up the hill - but to a certain extent, this fine art of art is intrusive because creates a mood that "something is going to happen" - and nothing does it. The script also fails against any plot or action or trauma - and it does not deliver every time. Not even delivering (I assume) the theme of the movie, the characters' essential misfit. The main actors, both too beautiful for their roles, did not transfer oppression or pain, and the script did not expose us to anyone. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? It's another story. His character was so well-fashioned, so perfectly played that I wanted the camera to follow him.
