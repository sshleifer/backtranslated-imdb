Yes, I certainly regretted giving up my Saturday night watching this weird little but very long movie. Apparently, the protagonist did not even steal two hours in my life. Here is the epitome of antihero in 'No Regrets.' We have this jerk, so shaken up, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unlikely that it was extremely difficult to get past the attraction of an extremely favored businessman's future son, Jaemin, unless it was just that: physical attraction. He claims otherwise it is love. But after seeing this, it's like loving Charles Manson because you're digging the beast. (Okay, he's not that bad, but still no real redeemable features.) I could never get past the cause Jaemin endless steals Sumin. It was never shown, just told that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy / stalking = crazy love over in Seoul. It must be because a little more than half of the movie is a stalking the other, and the last part stalking back and forth to the point I thought this turned into a screw basketball comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to get a look. Okay, so Sumin works two jobs while going to school, so far so good at someone trying to improve themselves. But after his first taste of his stalker's attraction, he gives his day job a kind of prostitution ring. What? Okay, as mentioned earlier, obsession does not stop because of the job / career change, and if you throw in a lot of other very angry characters, you get a messed up movie where incredible events just seem to happen without buildup. Basic film, not 100% horrible, but you can do better with alien gay-themed movies.
