This movie makes a promising start and gets so much confused and muddled. Kamal Hasan has made a great effort to make the period look right, sin he did not spend more time on the plot. Most of the small figures in the film do not appear without any particular reason. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
