Initially, I should point out that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you don't know why or what for. When you finally count on things, you just realize that only a twisted soup opera deals with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons. The characters are pretty bad, and the actors (especially the young ones) do not help much to make them look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a great actress, whether the movie is bad. The only positive thing to say about "Frío Sol De Invierno" is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he has filmed a few scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
