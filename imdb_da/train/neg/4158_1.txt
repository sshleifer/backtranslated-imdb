This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I've never seen a movie worse than this one !!! <br /> <br /> And I never mean !! <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of "B" horror movies. As you might imagine .... I've been exposed to something the movie industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I was lured to this movie titled. I mean c'mon ... which true fan of horror wouldn't be fascinated by a title like "Vampires vs Zombies" ??? Pictures of "undead" are fighting each other to "undeath" danced in my head. I was thinking of myself ... "I have to see this" !!!! Well .... sorry to say .... "what I wish I hadn't seen" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading to say the least. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact there is no reason !!!! If you were to ask me what this movie is about, I could honestly tell you I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie makes absolutely no sense !! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I felt sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project, for they probably have no business sense !!!
