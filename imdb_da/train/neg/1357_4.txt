* Can contain a spoiler of the kind? * The sheer mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geek pants in a pack. His milestone looks in Back to the Future when George McFly has sealed him to the American conscience forever. Recently, he has tried to return to the culty subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. This time, however, Crispin has made a 76-minute inexpensive dada movie. At times it reminded me of genius, while it almost insulted me at all, but not because of its content. Contents? What is it? is a movie in which one half of the film has all the actors Down's syndrome, giving it a freak show feel to it. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy. It all had the feeling of what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living while feeling more successful and wrong. <br /> <br /> Half with the Down Syndrome players also have many many killed snails. It's about a guy who has snails and ends up killing one. He is also afflicted by a lot of other people and a grasshopper. He falls in love with 2 girls, of whom he has sex in a cemetery. He also has an outcome with a friend who teases him. <br /> <br /> In a weird semi-interior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. He is something like the control of the guy's mind, and the cerebral palsy guy is something like sexuality. Now he is at least masturbated in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" pictures made humorous, as Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and the minstrels in black face say they're Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the persecutor is still on his love of killing snails and being beaten by the other people. They beat him with rocks and such. Later, they tried minstrel after trying him. <br /> <br /> Back to the interior, Crispin Glover is still in control of its set and trying to control everyone but otherwise fails. <br /> What is it? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari, and has more than one passing style stolen by it. The claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way in which the no-wall of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that was absolutely nonsense. And it was all wrapped with absurdist images for humor. The problem is about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? runs out of pictures. For the next 56 minutes, we continue to run on the same set of images, only the introduction of new images in the form of an absurdist puppet show. The movie seems a little more than a movie trying to push the envelope into offensive and taboo images. It tries to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that it only has enough different images for a 40 minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse than that, cinematography, set design and everything else felt very cheap and almost unplanned. It felt like "OK, that's how we can do it and get it out of the way." It did not feel interesting and was quite boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had fantastic filmography and framing. The difference between the two is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> rating: C
