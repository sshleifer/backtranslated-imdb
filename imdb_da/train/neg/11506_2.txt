This movie story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I can't understand much when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and could do all she wants, why should she fall in love with the bad man. 2. How can the history script be so weak? She was so rich, she can do everything she wants, but dare not divorce her husband who is very impossible. The words I love you do not matter in this movie.
