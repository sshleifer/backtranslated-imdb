Normally, I don't think Hollywood productions are suitable for being called movies, so I call them 'movies' instead. But this piece of elephant fertilizer is not even suitable for being called a movie, and thus the quotes in the title. Where do I start? 1. If this is not the start of geriatric casting, it is certainly the sign of it. Stefanie Powers must play no less than half of her age, she must play an 18-year-old, and she is VERY effing to !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible and stupid, thoughtless depiction of Paris and France, where we see clich√© characters such as: the sympathetic grumpy shop owner, the bitchy queen of models, fairy godmother ex-queen of models, etc. This movie has only been surpassed in this respect for the Da Vinci Code (as properly corrected reviewers were a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is very and completely ridiculous to have no nudity in a movie of a time and place where nudity was so commonplace, especially if the whole focus is on it <br /> <br / > 4. The awful accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Nana Mouskouri elevator music !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think that's enough. And I was able to do these observations after seeing this crap for just half an hour while browsing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
