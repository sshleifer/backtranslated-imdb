Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge played by Harvey Keitel whose life is fine until an ex shows and it gets a bit complicated. While I watched this movie, there were several times I asked myself why I was doing it because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and bad the script without any credibility. Nor does the audience keep car, what happens. Even the lovely Cameron can't save this on a scale of one to ten
