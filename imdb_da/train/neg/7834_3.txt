I don't usually write reviews, but I can't understand why this is rated so highly and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers as I can only assume that all the high ratings were given by average TV observers. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the first two episodes, but the two were so cliché, it wasn't even fun anymore. The same old stories you've probably seen / read a couple of times already - living toys, evil things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés. I prefer, for example. "chucky" and "quiet hill" over the two episodes anytime. and don't even ask about the visual effects ... those in the first episode are okay, but those in the other ... horrible. looks like a movie student's project has gone wrong. blood ... or do ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting for some ten-year-olds who probably haven't seen / read that many scary stories yet (although I'd rather recommend "beyond belief" - now that's what I call a decent mystery tv show). But for an adult horror fan it is worthless. I only gave the 3 points because there are actually some beautiful movie pictures (especially in the second episode) and some fine actors.
