Jack Black can usually make me snicker just by breathing, but in this movie ... Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant crushing (helped and maintained by constant straight-on camera images), and a .050 joke batting on average, it was still a total waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential was wasted with a complete lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I've seen this side of you-tube. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie portrayed Mexicans very negatively. Although it is undoubtedly true, I really do not think this film is meant to be racist. I think it's more of a "creative" team desperately trying to find something fun in this mess. You can almost hear them crying out behind the camera: "Hey, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things persistent, LAUGH!" <br /> <br /> But put racism aside aside. When you get to it, someone plunked good money and time to see this pile of remaining refried prayers that should be offended, IMO.
