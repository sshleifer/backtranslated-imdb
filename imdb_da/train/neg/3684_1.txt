They sell it as a horror movie, it should be a thriller, but I found it quite funny (comedy? Don't think so), I laughed the whole movie, I think it was because of the ridiculous action and plot. I do not blame the actors, I do not think they were very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy", I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she is also a beauty and a good actress, but let's try to be a small target here, the story etc. mm ... the direction mm etc ... it lacks a lot of good excitement in reality is a really boring movie, but there is a good thing tho, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME IT WAS 10 MINUTES DURING WATER !!!) <br /> <br /> I just don't know why this movie is rated so high, and in rat tomatoes, even higher, what's wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
