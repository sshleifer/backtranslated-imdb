Cut tries to be as most post-scream slashers tried to be, a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referring to other famous horror movies. Now I'm not baggage 'Scream', which I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a good job of mixing horror and comedy. The clip fails at most levels. It has its moments, but in general it just doesn't work, not even as a "so bad, it's good" movie, just a below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are OK and set history quite well, except for the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really work, and ironically she gets her tongue out, go figure. Continue some time and a group of film students want to finish their movie, which seems to be damned. And, as you probably predicted, one and the other crew and crew are slowly picked up by a masked madman. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal plot, poor action and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow. There are lots of references in the movie, ranging from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. It's also not smart, it feels like the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror-flicks ala Scream. For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a big negative when it comes to a slasher who hasn't got a lot to go after it. Really, I should support this movie because I'm Australian and we're not that good at horror (we have our jewels), but Cut is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> But it made me aware of the 90 minutes or so so it's something good at least. I would not recommend this to anyone except hardcore slasher fans who might appreciate what this movie is trying to aim for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
