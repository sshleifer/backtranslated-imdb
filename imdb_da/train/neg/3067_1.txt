This is just pretty bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they are from the original, are good ones alone. They can bring a different point of view and achieve a particular interpretation that makes them unique and comfortable. This was so poorly thought out and done as it could be. This was nothing good even standing on its own. Viggo Mortenson is a leading actor, but some of his choices of roles and projects leave something to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was an exciting, psychological adventure; This is not an adventure at all, and it is not fun or entertaining at all. This was made by a by-the-numbers approach to film making, stuffing in plot points that a person in Hollywood believes will delight what they see as today's movie-going audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It is insulting that someone will put this out like a feature film, and even try to rebuild a cult classic this dull. The manipulative plot units, the "do-it-obvious-so-the-not-miss-the-point" aspects, the ridiculous dialogue, the stereotypical characters, the amorphous direction ... <br /> <br /> This is plain bad ....
