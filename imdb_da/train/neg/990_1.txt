Don't waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the second movie called Descent (the girl about some travelers caught in a cave). So we decided to see it anyway thought it couldn't be that bad. It was. I can't believe this movie was actually produced and sent to the public. It was so terrible that it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away, but you just can't do yourself. I honestly feel emotionally scared. It went from being a semi-low budget movie where a college girl is being attacked by a boy, she dates to an all-out porn flick. And really not a good one. I went from pulling the woman's rape to almost feeling bad for him. Almost. All in all, a horrible movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Don't waste your money. And don't let your kids see it.
