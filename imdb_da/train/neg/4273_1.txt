There is nothing unique in either the TV series or the movies. Which is a prequel to the television show that doesn't exist anywhere in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynch's obnoxious history tells, and after. <br /> <br /> From the moment, the body of a badly mistaken girl washed up on the beach. And being introduced to some of Twin Peak's most frightening immoral character. <br /> <br /> For the mind that numbers almost pedophile obnoxious, the movie looks romantic from the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in Movie Twin Peak: Four Come Walk with me. <br /> <br /> I just saw it all to make sure I didn't miss anything. I did not do it. It is simply a man's overtly sexual fetish extended over long series framed by a ridiculous all-pornographic movie. Save yourself the pain, the excitement and see something else that at least has the ability to tell a story, rather seduce you to some kind of mental porn movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard many reviews, ranks and raves about how big David Lynch. Because of his ability to define misery and tragedy and make it a kind of wonderful thing. This is not life imitating art, as much as it is a sick, distorted version of the art that does its best to inspire the whole lifeless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
