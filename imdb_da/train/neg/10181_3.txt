This movie is so bad, it's funny. It stars Scott Backula as a coach, but that's not important, the important thing is the big black guy who plays the 1st base. First, he must be at least 75 years old, but play less and less league-baseball, second, he starts the movie at the outfield despite not being able to walk, let alone run. Coach Backula brilliantly brides him to first quote the fact that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for too long for a period. Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the movie, (SPOILER), he tells his star player "downtown" to beat a home run, clearly "downtown" seen this as a good move. He hit home race and won the fight for his team, a minor league game that played the twins, who were the class of the big ones in the movie. Now, if only Tony Muser, chief of the royals, would be just as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players simply to beat a home running in each with bats, Royals would never end up entering instead of losing a game.
