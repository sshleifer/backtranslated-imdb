At the end of the movie I asked myself, "Is that the worse movie I've ever seen or is it the worse movie I've ever seen?". And the answer is ... In fact, after watching this movie and thinking a little about the meaning of it, you just can't make any sense and you can only remember the two rape scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to push this question into the audience's head: "What are such crimes compared to war and extinction?" because I have noticed that the two terrible scenes that are directly linked to war and that are horrors (in the first scene you can here the girl being raped, screaming and at the same time hearing a President Bush's talking about the necessity of To start a war with Iraq and in the second scene, the images of the three criminals sticking a sword in a woman's stage, followed directly by World War II archive images. different kinds of human horror expressions, made i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt. (sorry for bad english)
