It is not obvious to see this movie (so I recommend that viewers examine the people presenting their case in it), but this presentation on the realities of Islam and its encouragement to violence and intolerance to all non-Muslims lacks objectivity and also complete lacks factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Qur'an says many things about how a devoted Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not all people who feel themselves to be an advocate of Islam will agree with and abide by all principles of this belief and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters in doubt, so viewers should see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; do not slug everything, hook, line and sink, without thinking of your own. A specific, for example, examines the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed a terrorist act in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in any of these claims. Nor have I been a Muslim. I never read the Quran. I am not a Christian or a member of a faith. But I am an intelligent and discerning person. While the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how some Muslims see their commitment to Islam; I remind you that there is more to Islam than the views of fundamentalists. Like their fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, there are also variations in the intensity of faith and commitment among Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you need the salt shaker on hand. A grain will not be enough, you need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, examine what is being presented, and assess the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread with political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a particular bias. Be your own brain.
