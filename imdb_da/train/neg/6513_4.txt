I'd rather have 20 root channels than reviewing this movie again. Prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, has wasted almost two hours of my life with this cynical pseudo-cool piece. The only entertaining thing in all this mess is Mr. Samaha's unpleasant off-camera tits about breasts and ass. Berkowitz takes a good concept and laughs it in the dust. It is rude and badly done in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or fun. Nor is it. I rarely feel that a movie was a waste of film (or tape), but this one is qualified for that distinction. If a date suggests watching this movie, you need to run.
