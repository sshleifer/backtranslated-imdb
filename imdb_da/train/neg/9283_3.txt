I don't know how this movie has received so many positive reviews on this site! I am a great vonnegutfan and am very familiar with the story of this Showtime original movie bastardized over belief, but even though I was not, the poor, VERY bad casting (Sean Astin as the brilliant, athletic and the whole individual, seemed Harrison? The guy is quite generic!) And substandard writing made this tripe hardly easy. Someone pointed out how sweet the Maculay Culkin line was. If you read it and thought it was pure comic book (unfortunately it was probably the most INTENTIONELY fun part of the movie), maybe you would like this movie. But if you're a Vonnegut fan or not quite crazy, you can't see it. Please.
