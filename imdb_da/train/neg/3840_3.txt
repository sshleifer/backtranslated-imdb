I had heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of expectation and excitement as we both heard that this was a scary movie, really scary. How disappointed was I? MUCH!!!! Except for one scene (we all know what bit) nothing happened !!! I waited to see the woman in black a couple of times and for her to make a few more jumped scenes, such as looking out the window or walking across the hall or something. Almost all reviews here say what a scary, poignant, atmospheric movie is here. I didn't see, I'm scared. Perhaps there is a difference in what people find scary in the US for here in the UK. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all hyped reviews :(
