This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - surpassing the former most god-fearing movie, "Spawn of Slithis," which I saw when I was about 10. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, stylish and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, broken scenes, although the music was annoying. Did I leave anything? The special effects weren't bad, but CGI doesn't make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I actually spent money watching this movie. If anyone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (the director), send it to my username "on gmail" and I will contact him to claim a refund.
