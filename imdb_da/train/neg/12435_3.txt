Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film in the Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies acquire a missile control system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote toy car. Due to baggage confusion, grouchy gets Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) car. She gives it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies come up. The spies rent a house to break into every house in the neighborhood until they find the car. At home alone with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he sees a theft, but the spies always manage to escape the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls. The spies finally turn their attention to Alex, unaware that he has rigged units for the wise booby trap all over the house. Home Alone 3 wasn't terrible, but probably shouldn't have been made, you can't just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some fun parts, but I do not like when characters change in a movie series, look at their own risk.
