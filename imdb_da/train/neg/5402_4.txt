This movie is so incredible; - the whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around without tracks and kill as many people as the movie entails is ridiculous. The vampire itself would not look out of place in a Bela Lugosi movie. Most of the play is then wood, the actors must be treated for dry advice. I await the day when someone makes a decent movie from a Steven King novel (with the exception, possibly of Stand by Me). This movie suffers from what most Stephen King movies do - lack of money used for the "special" effects, bad actors, scary characterization and dialogue. This movie is cheap, sticky and fails in everything it tries to do.
