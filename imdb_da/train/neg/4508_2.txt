Andrewjlau, I couldn't agree. My boyfriend is looking at this right now and I find this movie appalling. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They do all this for a man!?" <br /> <br /> I think these women have no intensity, no sense of a struggle between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. Under the dance scene, where Zhang Zi Yi wins, the men look stupid more than admire. Japanese people have far more intensity than the Chinese, and being geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces didn't match the main ones. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is so unmistakable, so American. If a European had done so with European orientations, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I should add: it seems that most people who liked the movie are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. Everything spelled for you, not instinctively, not passionately. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I couldn't say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, the cinematography is amazing, but I really can't see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals. I'm going to Japan to see the right thing. I'm sure it would be great to see.
