I had completely forgotten this movie so far. This was the most obvious and worst attempt to demonize a hobby I've ever seen. It seemed to be: "Do not use teens with their imagination, they can take games seriously, become angry and hurt people." I can only guess that the imaginative writers of this piece believed that D&D style games are kind of evil ritual or arcane worship.
