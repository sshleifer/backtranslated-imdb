The thinner's plot is definitely thin. And gross. An overweight lawyer runs over the gypsum woman, and the gypsy's curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to the leg. Okay, Gypsy curses must be entertaining, but weight loss is bad? Nix. Except Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another scary writer and writer for this monstrous movie does it too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is also fat, haha! The thinner is like an immature piece of shit for a person who inhibits how he / she has never seen anything as obnoxious as obesity. Hi, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
