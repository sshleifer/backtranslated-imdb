I can't remember seeing another murder / mystery movie as bad as this. This film about a doctor examining his friend's mysterious death in a car accident has the full acknowledgment of a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of excitement, bad humor and no drama. I remembered watching this movie at PAX, a television station known for handing out low-budget and campy made-for-TV movies like this one. Of course, television films do not have the edge factor or the excitement of movies from the Big Screen. But this movie certainly hit all acidic tastes. The actors in this movie have missed an opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great television movie; the title gives some tension. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, don't watch this movie. This movie alone can kill your TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Degree F
