This movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, I assume. It's really sad, because at a deeper level, the title is 'Vanishing Point' the original, so ironic. I am sure it was not that way, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. The real "VANISHING POINT" was the end of an era that largely ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all the countercultural elements have been removed and made more PC in an attempt to reach a wider audience, presumably. "Sanitized for your protection" <br /> Inserting the American Indian scenes was free and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for the trip was subtraction by addition. I'm glad I saw it though, it made me appreciate the original so much more. The original is a cool classic and golden. This remake is awful.
