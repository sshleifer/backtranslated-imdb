The ballad in Django is a winding mess in a movie! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from others (and much better!) Films allegedly tied together by "Django" and tells how he brought in various crimes. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this one unless you just have to have every Django movie made and even it can't be a good enough excuse to watch this one!
