After the already disappointing "Final Conflict" hit the series of rock bottom with this very weak fourth post. At least, the third film (unsuccessfully) tried to continue the story of Damien, while simply rehashing and copying ideas from the "Omen" (animals are afraid of the antichrist, a man's death is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first movie). But what's so exciting and creative that just looks stupid here. And the little girl simply looks like a spoiled child.
