LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he is the star? I should have known better than renting EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew it better. But in a moment of absolute weakness I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. As of Saturday. Like this did. And with good reason. The reason, as such, involves a group of corrupt mordercops on MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake is the only brave enough to uncover them. He's targeted for his efforts - or maybe I should say for his horrible plays. I knocked it off after one of the evil guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before he collapsed. Just awful. The right tipoff for how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and in the whole movie sporting a monstrous beard, looks like nothing like a hobo. You just know that the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumbering.
