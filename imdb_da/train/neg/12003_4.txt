Six different pairs. Six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eighty number of audiences in the cinema. Look at the 80 different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm in somewhere between those looking in the middle of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories have no connection with each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani is trying to show some relationship between them. I tried to figure out a few lines I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes I didn't find anything to write. The movie is a bad copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Don't watch the movie if you really want to see a good movie.
