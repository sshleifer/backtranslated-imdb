I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find out that only people who actually worked on the film had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tune it a little. "Groundbreaking" is a little over the top. This is a Boston-based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college movies. That's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. A silly action film without much creativity. It's pretty fun if you're willing to poke fun on it. Not something you will ever see unless you are a student at Emerson College.
