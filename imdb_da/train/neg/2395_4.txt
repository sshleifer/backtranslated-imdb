Could this be the same director as not looking now or bad time? Bad <br /> <br /> acted, wisely edited. You only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar in Do not Look Now to see how much Roeg has lost its <br /> <br /> touch. Even the generally reliable Teresa Russell (looks a little chunky these days I'm afraid to report) can't save this. The reason is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the play is wood, and Roeg's attempt at his trademark transformation of time is pitiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as bothered.
