At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) why she is constantly searching for an adventure. She said "because I am drill-like". That means she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities. Well, I think her reason and the way this movie goes is very ironic. Because "Watching the Detectives" is a rejoicing boredom. <br /> <br /> Have any of these characters actually done something exciting for once? Neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental store. He and his other geeks usually hang around the store and watch movies together while discussing them afterwards. But Neil's life is completely reversed when Violet enters her shop. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. Anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. The problem is that Violet is someone who continues to make prank jokes on Neil and can't really do anything normal while Neil is quite the opposite. The question is. Should they fall in love with the end? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Watching the Detectives" is a clich√© romantic comedy for the core. And they made it even worse by pretending to be something else. From the first couple of setups, we know that Neil is a beautiful casual guy who has not really committed himself to anything. And then Violet enters the scene and looks all weird and annoying. So at this point, we all know that we will sit, even though all meaningless situations need to figure out how to end in the end. Is it worth waiting for? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they were trying to give something more to the audience. "Watching the Detectives" is trying to talk about engagement. To observe how far people go to reach something they want. We finally knew that crazy things that Violet has done are the whole test of how far Neil is ready to go to win her heart (or anything). Well, I think it's absolutely scary. This movie ends pretty fast if Neil just said to himself "Forget it, that girl is one of a nutjob!" After collaborating with many major directors recently (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 Days Later", Ken Loach's "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" and Neil Jordany's "Breakfast on Pluto" to name a few), quite strange choice for Cillian Murphy to make a movie with one of Broken Lizard's comedy troop, Paul Soter. In no way is he not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor that he should not waste his time in the movie like this. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly horrible as Violet. Her acting is a mess. I mean it's everywhere and so over-the-top. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last but not least mistake that the movie is made is a completely irrelevant title. You simply cannot really connect a dot between the plot and its title; And then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. In short, "Watching the Detectives" is enjoyable if you can forget about a movie that you might have the opportunity to catch on cable TV so quickly that you couldn't imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
