What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth, who specialized in smooth, changing alliances, did not get hold of this concept first. He could have helped spread the real potential, especially with the interesting character William Bishop played. As the film says, it's pretty much a mess (as claimed by reviewer Chipe). The biggest issues are with the direction, cheap budget and poor script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept - characters drawn in different directions by opposing forces. What was needed was a person with the vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into a kind of coherent whole, instead of the bubbly, awkward mess it is (try to find out the motivations and interaction if You can). A larger budget could also have matched up contrasting location and studio shots and got the locations out of the overly obvious LA fringe. The real shame lies in the wasting of an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were shortened), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their incredible death. Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this poorly unclear western, who in the right hands could have been so much more.
