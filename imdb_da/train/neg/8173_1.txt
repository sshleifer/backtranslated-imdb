One of the most boring slashers ever .. If you can call it yourself. I didn't want to see this if it ended up being a kind of porn movie that it looks quite like. The fact that you see a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They made these kind of movies for teenagers, so who were they really targeting when they made this sleeping party? My favorite part of this movie is the cover, and that's the only reason I chose to find this movie, which happened to be part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and after watching the other movies in this movie 50-pack, will realize that it does not belong elsewhere. So if you are in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend just before dawn and finally terror.
