Really, really bad. How does a movie get this bad? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work or at least some free nudity but I got nothing. I had just seen Cabin Fever, and I thought it was a train wreck (except for nudity and pancakes), but it looks like genius to this killer. The best manuscript doctor in the world could not have saved this rugged pile of smelly poo. <br /> <br /> The only thing that goes into this "movie" is that it ended. <br /> <br /> I have a headache, just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I only paid $ 5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill.
