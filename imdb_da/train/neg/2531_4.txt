The title song for this movie ........... is the greatest free exciting ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie back in 1978-79 when I first subscribed to cable. In 1979 the cable just started to become commonplace in the home. (or at least that when it became common here in Missouri). It may well be the first movie I have ever seen on the pay channel called "The Movie Channel" - called "The Star Channel," then they changed the name to "The Movie Channel" in the early 1980s. ....... I received a free month with "The Star Channel" with my new cable subscription. "The van was one of those movies that was in sharp rotation on that network at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie since then and thought it was a typical teenage girl ( in the same line as other mid-sized budget teen flicks) ... those where the plot revolves around nudity and parties, I completely forgot that this movie itself existed until I recently watched this movie again after not seeing it for decades (I found a copy of it on DVD for sale in cheap bin) I recognized it and bought it for only $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> I think I remembered this movie was much better that it was (is But seeing it again was a different experience than watching now (30+ years later). It was fun to see the children's listing for rock n roll music, weed smoking and having back in the back a decorative van (often all at the same time.) This is what a good teenage movie should be. There is not much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals look close ... he blows all his college savings money to buy a tricked out dodge van (with shag carpet walls. mirrored the ceiling and a water bed in it) to get her attention and he eventually has sex with her. But his arch rival finds out and searches for him (so that the two can settle their differences by pulling their carts) .... he and his arch rival end up destroying both of their vans and instead of stealing away his arch rival's boyfriend, he wins over the heart of a preppy (less attractive) girl whom he half / ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier and better and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> The movie has fun moments. But watching this movie 30+ years later becomes more of a trip down memory. Because I still remember Pizza Parlors, Pinball Arcades, It also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked jar as we would shout at pretty girls and hope to be laid (sometimes I will succeed and get a decent see girl sharing a joint with me and we would turn in the back seat afterwords, i can also remember many of the songs in this step (when they were new) ...... this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for the era in these respects (reminded many) <br /> <br /> the only thing depicted in this movie that I honestly can't remember is .... I never remember a time when full size vans were as popular as this film portrays them as being. I remember the era very well, and I do not go young men who want them to have a van. Instead, I remember young men in the 70s (self-included) who want a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van this film makes it seem like vans were the most popular items and that every young man wanted one (which just wasn't true for the era)
