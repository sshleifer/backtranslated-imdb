While it's a great James Arness western, this movie has gone down as the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was horrible, inaccuracy through it, and just plain truths to start! The continuity was thrown to the four winds. Someone catches the gun sequence? The Mexicans were stupid enough to shoot guns, which of course had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the pipes. Come on! Then there's Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer must have been away or something. Or just out of their minds!
