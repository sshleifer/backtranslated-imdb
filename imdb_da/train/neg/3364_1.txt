So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people being asked to come to this house, and (not surprisingly) the gatekeepers are always locked at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laughing, joke etc. This Dr tells them a creepy story about this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees s ghost. Some more talk then comes this great ghost and etc. Etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed young children and that she must free their souls, yes yes blah blah. She does, but oh no, she dies as she does. And going to heaven, while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The manuscript is terrible because a guy gets his head cut off and Elanor (the one who dies to save the kids) says "Oh no". The action is wood, the effects are crap and the set is a couple of rooms that are used again and again. Basically, if you like to laugh at badly made movies watch it, but if you're looking for a scare, then surely give this movie a cheek. I was very disappointed when I saw this. A very big disappointment. My sister (who gets very holy) bored in this movie, it is appalling.
