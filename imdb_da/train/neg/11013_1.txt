I'm in bad movies, but it has nothing to do with it. Despite what the morons above have said, it's not fun. I know comedy and underground movies, but it is so boring that the director / author should be banned from EVER to manage other than local cable access ever again! To love movies and comedy is to despise this movie. I must never come across how unfunny and boring this work was. If you like this movie, you are a pothead who enjoys there is nothing here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do something, but if it's not fun, you're not satirical, you're not edgy, you're just pathetic, and this movie is simply not fun. ZERO!
