This movie is in the MANDINGO & DRUM type <br /> <br /> They were both terrible, but they are 100% better than this tripe. <br /> <br /> Poorly traded and made Oliver Reed is the main name & Eartha Kitt is also in it. It's a shame. Rating is 1/2 * about as low as you can get <br /> <br /> as always <br /> <br /> jay harris
