Spoilers forward, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review made up of questions only? Could it be that? Why bury an ancient civilization artefacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why did the opening text become incoherent? Why would a nun (she probably seemed fine!) Survive 20 orphans for a lunatic? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the axes of the gold coin end in the parents' front yard? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up on Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would a non-archaeologist also open a clearly valuable solid gold coffin with a sledge hammer? Why would modern computers still show green sketches of pre-Tron era objects, complete with small "bleeds"? And should all movie-explosive timers have digital displays? Why doesn't something in this movie make sense?
