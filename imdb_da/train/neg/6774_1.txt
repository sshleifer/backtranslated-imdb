As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and shout with laughter as the AMC billed it as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with a movie! Cary's usual charm and effortless comedy is AWOL from all this movie; He comes across as strained, bored and just not himself. Mississip's character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrectly, according to which part of the Mississippi he claims to haul), and when he delivers a line, it's more decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to stand out in the movie as a lovable, land-bumpkin goofball, but in the end he only manages to degrade the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting, this movie screamed that she never had that ability to begin with. Ray Walston's character was sugar and ultimately constructed. For four men on land leave, it was the tameest holiday I've ever seen. I saw this nightmare to its end, and while I won't spoil it for anyone, I'll tell you it's the most absurd thing you'll ever see. The movie tries to rub patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men, but the film misses that point entirely because of its weak plot line and weak cast. Sorry, Cary!
