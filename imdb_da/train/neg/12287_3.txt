In the late 80's, an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films was set in gloomy penitentiary settings. Renny Harlin's excellent gritty and moody "Prison" got the whole haosegow ball rolling; It was immediately followed by the remarkably subordinate "The Chair", John Saxon's cosily sweet "Death House", the well-liked psycho-image "Destroyer" and this secret limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium. <br /> <br /> Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student colleges is led by spooky spineless tormented twerp Alex (the incredible unappealing Nicholas Celozzi) going to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden cruel death of op and upcoming rock star Sammy Mitchell (mixed game by Toni Basil in "Hey Micky" fame). Alex's brother is obsessed with the evil demonic spirit of an evil cannibalist commander of the American Civil War cavalry and continues with the expected killing spree, thus forcing Wimpy Alex to overcome his inaction and oppose this ghoulish ghost. <br /> <br /> Although Nicholas Von Sternberg photographed with a few decent gore sets and a lot of spooky atmosphere (the film was shot on the spot in Alcatraz Island's stupid, rusty, worn-out ruins), "Slagterberg" does less just do not cut it as a solid, effective scare function. This is largely due to the uniformly contradictory and inaccurate collegiate smartcheck characters, a deadly beautiful pile, whose inane comic antics turn out to be lattice instead of entertaining. The apartment, which appears from a noticeably uninterested cast, hurts more, once the "Playboy" playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie top Hope Marie Carlton makes a particularly annoying Linnea Quigley imitation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo. Dimitri Logothetis' direction shows a brave of flashy visual style, but the tone is unevenly set between grim serious and goofy, horrible sophomoric silliness, and Ted Landon's sloppy, inconsistent, overly complicated and eventually rather confusing script fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the distant history even extremely plausible. In other words, this stink, unfortunately, manages to make a gentle 90 minutes to act as a monstrously drawn prison sentence.
