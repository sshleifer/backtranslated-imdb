There have been lots of unknown movies or movies with bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> Camera technology was exaggerated and made me feel like I saw a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and took most of the movie to get started and left you asking "that's it?". When I decided not to take the film too seriously and from the purely corny point of view, it was more enjoyable. This is a movie that would have ended on the MST3000 if it was still on.
