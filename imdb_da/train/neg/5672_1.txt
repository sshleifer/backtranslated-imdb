I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most redeeming factor for owning the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My voice for this movie is a great fat ZERO. Don't get me wrong, I'm a scared girl. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention I prefer the evil to happen to people, not to be fooled into looking at what seemed like forever, cut off the snus. Brutal actions interrupt painfully long silence and bad action. If I was forced to compare to another movie, the only one who comes to mind is the cannibal holocaust. Poor, boring, meaningless and a completely unpleasant watch.
