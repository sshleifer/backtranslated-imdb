First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. However, this movie destroyed the excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having crazy curls and glasses and is considered very unclear. In the film she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle depicted Me at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just a great example of how the book and the film are different. Then I would say that if you want to see it for entertainment, watch it, but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I suggest skipping this movie.
