I remember seeing this at prime time when I was about 7 years old. I was a giant comic book reader at that time, and all that was related to superheroes was expected to be strong. The end result was, however, inevitable. <br /> <br /> I was aware of the Diana Prince stories "Emma Peel" when they had just come to an end and Diana returned to her Amazon form. But there was so little action that I get bored of most of the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie again in my late teens. It hadn't improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more well known, thanks to it's incredible, but her acting wasn't better. The script had a few good ideas, such as the Scottish Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built the back story better and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too much like a boring spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a cartoon. The Amazon elements were exciting but had to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force manufacturers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if it was a bit for camp and low budget. The budget was also quite low here, and superheroes don't come cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, just as a comparison and a historical document. Even Superman 4 is available and has nothing over this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth looking for curiosity guilt and too little inspiration and caution for future versions.
