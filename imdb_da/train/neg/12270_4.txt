This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild, and it had at least one jumper that shot me away. But all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, where a detective tries to track a suspected serial killer, only to find out that he might have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a beautiful Asian ghost, and has no idea why (nor the viewer). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused as the murderers can easily be found, and this ghost still struggles for some reason. Not only is the plot completely silly, the lady's ghost is more fun than anything, especially when she suddenly flies over the city, like Wonder Woman. And the end makes little sense, in fact the whole movie makes little sense, and I can't recommend it at all. If it didn't look so serious, I would think it should be a black comedy. Outside "Bright Future" this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I've seen yet.
