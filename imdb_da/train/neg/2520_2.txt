OK this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the movie, they had just gone through an apocalyptic war, but they have the money to buy big robots and beat them against each other. Instead, each country decides to invest in the reconstruction of their country, they would rather fight with robots that nobody could afford. Here's a better idea, let's rely on our most inappropriate resource, jocks, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what about the director, what about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no need to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he might sleep? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was so cheesy and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I actually had a good time watching it, except for the cowboy mentor, who turns out to be an assassin (believe me, no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it's a surprise but lame) What kind of training exercise is one jungle you anyway. I was sorry to see that Mst3k hadn't done this. I give a two star rating though because nothing could be as bad as the "manos of the fateful". The budget doesn't matter either, I've seen lots of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. The story wasn't even plausible, and I've seen better plays in school games. Surly they could have made an eleven year old from any middle school game. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it's a fun movie to watch.
