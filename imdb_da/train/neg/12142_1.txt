Please, for God's love do not see it. Now I say what I know what you think, it can't be that bad, can it? If everyone says it as bad as they say, I have to see it! Don't do it! It will be like looking at a terrible accident with little babies and a gas tanker! You will be scared for life ... the picture will never leave you! I could only see half an hour before I became violently ill. The play is the worst I have ever seen and I have seen Barbwire !!! If you risk tearing your eyes out and renting this movie ... don't say I haven't warned you! Tires and storyline are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was amazing! This movie should be the same .... right? NONE!! The printer = scare control = rubbish game = there were no plays. Still not convinced? Then your soul will forever be plagued !!!
