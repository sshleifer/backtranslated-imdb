The reason I was going to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours in my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and hopefully appreciate Indian cinema. All I ever saw was some older films by S.Ray. <br /> <br /> Looking through IMDb I came across this and after seeing rating of 8.7, I concluded that this should be what opens the doors to unknown and bring artistic pleasure. Oh my how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of the 970 voters are Indian and their only venture outside the Bolliwood production was Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> With this rating, this movie would be ranked in 9th place on the IMDb List of 250 Best Movies on Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing I find worth remembering from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus who like me find this movie as it is - simple silly, with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music.
