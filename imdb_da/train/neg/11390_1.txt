This is not a movie. It's a collection of unrelated, mind-boggling and poorly-mounted scenes that resemble the unedited results of a weak 10-year-old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, darpe-star, ipod and nervous tic - surely shot it even in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you did it longer than the ten minutes I did, don't bother trying to watch what you saw in the context of the European artistic mentality that was praised. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and movies that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine cringe. The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed figures are representative of what now passes too much of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six executives shoot intercourse at Wal-Mart snack counter?
