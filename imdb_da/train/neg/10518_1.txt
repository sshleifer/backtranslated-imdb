Oh kitten, where do I go with this? Herretous acting, weak plot, stupid deaths, meaningless nudity ... <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment ... this is hell. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money, time or life on this evil's pit. <br /> <br /> It's just ... god fan is this movie horrible! Tom Savini, why? Why would you waste your life on this lap? This movie is not worth it. I would rather cheat and crush my head against a wall than see THIS ... this sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please take my advice and keep f # @ k away from this elephant door of a movie. No, you know what? Don't even call this thing a movie! Just stay away!
