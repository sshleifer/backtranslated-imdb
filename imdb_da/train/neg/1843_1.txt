Wow. Simply horrible. I was the fan of the original movie, and sat down as opposed to part 2, 3 and improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But nothing is as bad as Freddy's nightmare. Freddy seems like a Rod Serlingesq host of this anthology series. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy became a punchline after another, but at least in the films, Freddy's appeal film made the films, but here it was so badly made, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. The bad actors, if you really want to call yourself that after this show was, of course, exactly what they paid for. I'm almost sure this was a stopover for two types of actors. They just started on the Hollywood ladder, brand new willing to take any part that would discourage their having to take the porn job they were offered last week, or seasoned actors heading down the Hollywood ladder willing to take any part who would put without having to take the porn job they were offered last week. <br /> <br /> I was expecting half Dana Plato for the guest star, but she was already dead when it was in production. <br /> <br /> Rewriting Nancy's line in the original Elm St, "What ever you're not trying to sleep, sees this."
