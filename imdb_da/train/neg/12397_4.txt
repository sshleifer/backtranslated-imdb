I read a place where this film was to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, "Criss Cross." I found the latter to be disappointing, but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "neo-noir" as it is modern and in color, two things like purists would disqualify it for film noir status. <br /> <br /> However, the biggest negative for it was not the cinematography (it was fine) but the confused story. Hi, some of the '40s Dashiell Hammett stories were alike, but I didn't care about any of them either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks in history, what seemed every three minutes. No wonder it was up with this story. That was ridiculous! What happens with the 45 minute mark is their so confusing that no one cares more. I know I didn't.
