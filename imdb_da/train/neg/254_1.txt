Ah, bait. How do I hate you? Let me count the way. 1. You are trying to be fun but are corny and unenjoyable; Any joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to throw. 2. You are trying to be dramatic, but are incredible; The woman is in a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and is as scary as ... Well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to scare someone with a gun. It doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Don't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watch him try To deliver a Dramatic and intense dialogue is ridiculous and makes me throw. 3. You are trying to be action packed, but instead are boring and dragging too many times. And when the action warms up, the camera stand must have been lost, because the scenes are waving more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseous and once again I will throw. 4. You are trying to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! I'd rather go barefoot over the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerk and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a minute more spent watching everyone in bait hand over their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes into a car as Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape ... just kill me now or do the right thing and allow me to somehow never have to watch a movie that is so bad ever again.
