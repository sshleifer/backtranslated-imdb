Hammerhead is a combination of the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres. Jeffrey Combs plays in a part of the casting type the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human / hammerhead shark creature. Bizarre, this being is actually his son whom he has become to this monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of contributors are invited to the researcher's private island. They end up being used as shark bait or shark buddy. For some unknown reason, the IT manager has been brought together as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be a resourceful, if somewhat overweight, Ramboesque hero. I work on the assumption that he learned to deal with a riot as part of his day job in the first line of support. A normal day for this IT man presumably involves setting a person's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun-toting malicious people. Or maybe a call to repair a person's PC should be planned between physical confrontations with land-based human-shark hybrids? Anyway, he is fantastic and saves the day. He even gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Shark man is a little lame creation, but OK, I think judging by the effects generally in this movie. And the film continues at a decent pace. Of course it is Hokum of course, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts that a man experienced, turn into a land-based killer fish, then you really have no one to blame but yourself. As there are cannons, gore, girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter. It's rubbish, but not as bad as some might say.
