I will try to use words to describe this .... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but then I should have feared a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was 'scared' when I picked this one up, but now that I've seen it, I have to say it's even worse when I thought. Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not that good, but it must be said, some make the heads of being just horrible. But what can an actor do with a script like this. It tries to be a copy of the original only this time, the sites have changed, any kind of story is gone, and any attempt to actually come up with something that has not been done before, fails miserably. In a vain attempt to get it updated, they are trying to make it exciting by utilizing the whole 'big brother' theme, but it has been worn early since and offers only one filler for the beginning and the end. It was tried to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original, but it just ended up being ordinary fun and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing and I mean nothing to do ... you should see it, or play Frisbee ... with the DVD itself. It gives you the same fun .. I promise
