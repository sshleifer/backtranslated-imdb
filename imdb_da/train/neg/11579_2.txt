I have to admit, I don't remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure there was one, I was so annoyed by this movie that I had a little trouble focusing on it. How can you name a movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then film it in Texas? The flat desert land around Arlington (I think it was the location) is by no means similar to the green hills around Tulsa and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. Of course, no one in the movie has ever been to Tulsa or else they have understood how nothing in the film even looked like. Didn't anyone at least have seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know that sounds mean, but I can't help it. I saw this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two exciting actors could not experience this meandering and medieval story of self-drawn people who are NOT in TULSA !! Sorry, filming in Oklahoma can't be more expensive. What if "living and dying in LA" had been shot in Toronto? Would it suck? It also does well.
