I refused to see it here when it was originally sent, and pay tribute to the late, deplored 1960's series of Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. Not quite a remake, and more of a parody than a tribute, this show did not really know how to play it and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon character and characters. The three main characters were a little more than the cartoons of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a straight roll). The support aids were only comedian announcements by Vic and Bobs wanting to be part of in-joke and all too aware that the situation was convincing. And the CGI, although the effects couldn't help improve the available 30 years ago, just dazzled the viewer with light and camera work and did little to dampen the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All style and no fabric. (And while the 1960s turn out to be mocked to be much of his time, this update is now also very dated, with 'Matrix' style fashions, mandatory 'girl power' scenes, and less than subtle excitement between the two live leads .)
