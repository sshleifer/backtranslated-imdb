Solid comedy entertainment with musical interludes, it generates a fast pace that brings cases together at soulful pace through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre are a strong setup of creepy villain. The script contains all standard mystery movie props-sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning, and poisoned blow-darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre are in favor of heavy teachers and obvious melodramatics of the time of gas. Kay Kyser and his band spent great entertainment for the people who lived in the 1940s who tried to forget the horrors of World War II.
