This series would have been much better if they had just done a simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. The Diamond Head character needs a person who could handle the role of the lovable villain that McShane proved to do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond Head, is really only so-so in the role. McShane is not as good as the bad guy. France Nuy's character, Tso-Tsing, may not seem to make up for her whether she is the unfortunate victim or the hard and ready to fight woman. She really earned her salary at the end when she was to play the role of Diamond Head's lover. After seeing an episode or two, I didn't end up breaking what happened to anyone. Wood gives us a lot to hate him, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to like him. Unfortunately, the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960s.
