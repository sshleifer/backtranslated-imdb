It's amazing that a script like clich√© and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one. The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman a high culture classic. Billy Zane plays the bad asshole game Elvis imitates, gunsling, martial arts master who is playing the life of a downward previous soccer player who has become a game engineer, played by the winner of NBC's crap-style "Next Action Star". His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. "The movie" takes place in Vegas, and when people play poker, the authors thought it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against a ubiquitous, wealthy player who offered his goal $ 2. 4 million if he can do it throughout the day. And then the hunt follows. A hunt that moves up with unimpressive explosions, structures for shipyards, skimmed filmography and one-lines containing the word "bet" or "gamble". The female winner is also thrown into the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh but don't worry about "NAS" fans, the losers make their memorable cameos too. The surprising end will turn off your socks if you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reconsider its decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me back the two hours of my life.
