Hawked as the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to postpone all-guessing what? It worked, I'm offended that we have spoken money to rent this. Two friends and I are bored and decided to see if all the stuff about the movie we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that shot this waste on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crazy but sucked into it. We have since struck the dot, indicating that we are renting it, and his movie recording rights have been revoked. There is nothing far-fetched about this movie ... even in the "dickman scene" adventure was at best sophomoric. Colors me p *** ed. Perhaps the production value was bad for some important reason ... no ... I just sucked. NEVER SEE THIS! for any reason. Not even with abundant amounts of illegal substance, this movie would be fun. It says a lot. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you value your beauty - never see this movie. There are many things - stupid, meaningless and worthless to mention a few. But the most important thing was to aim for: aggressively fun - it failed miserably. Crash and burn.
