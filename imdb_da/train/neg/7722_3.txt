Extremely bad action movie starring in the tree Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee caught in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. The action is at best average, a bit of nudity in and yes Tia Carrera uses a body double! <br /> <br /> The lineup is the usual renegade politician who is forced to break into a new business partner on a big deal and at least decision makers try to give the formula a twist, making Lundgren the police with oriental values ​​and Lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical, Lundgren's oriental warrior outfit for the big show must be seen as being believed. The action sequences are of the numbers, and Lee (who would continue to make the excellent The Crow) never gets to show any particular martial arts brilliance. However, given his brilliant custody, he must have been under a lot of pressure and was much better served without having to live up to his father by taking a completely different role in The Crow, who showed what a unique actor he might has become if not for his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80s style action movies (think Cobra etc.) then avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
