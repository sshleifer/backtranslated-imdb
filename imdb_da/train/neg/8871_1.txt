I probably see 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home, and I can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst I have seen this year (if not ever, but I haven't actually seen "Quest of the Delta Knights" yet). This movie is just bad joke after the bad joke geared to the 13-year-old and because I had the displeasure of seeing it on a bus trip, I couldn't go out. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental lane. The four dollars could be better spent on any movie of numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
