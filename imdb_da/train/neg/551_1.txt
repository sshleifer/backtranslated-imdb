I've gone through AFI's list of the top 100 comedies, and I have to say that this is really one of the worst. Not only of the 90 movies on the list I've seen, but of any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley is not. Liza made it almost worthwhile, but alas ... just go see Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughs and drinks have to be fun? I would highly recommend almost any other movie on AFI's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a more fun "full", try The Thin Man. Funnier movies in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're as full of Arthur).
