Dudes on MST3K should watch this dog by a movie. It's basically a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can't land any plays. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this stupid actor do? He colors his hair lace and starts acting like a L.A. Surfer dude in naive hope, this will get him acting roles. You will laugh your head on so many of this movie are accidentally fun scenes. As when the actor's girlfriend is heart broken and insidious and says lines like, "How could you do it for me?" And why is she laughing? Cos he colored his hair blonde and became a surfer guy for acting. This movie makes no sense at all! The actor who played the governor at Benson is also in this and plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a lot of stupid, fun dialogue. This movie will turn you up, trust me. Are you talking to me?!
