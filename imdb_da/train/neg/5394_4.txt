I get annoyed with modern adjustments by Shakespeare when the director does not want to use the original or update it. If it uses the original words in an up-to-date setting, it is particularly difficult if it is set in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work OK in periods, e.g. Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night, which is late Victorian very effective. It could work with the setting of 30, if there was only much less of the song and dance and much more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it ends up being a rather trivial but very pleasant show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is such an experienced shakespeare actor who, despite all his efforts to be just another student, shows his strength play all the time. Of course, he should have played the king - no problem with having a mature student king surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a comfortable but unimposing actor for the king, and thus an unimposing so-called king without royal attributes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the amount of song and dance I found boring despite the good songs and dancing enough, meant that the great Shakespeare dialogue had to be drastically reduced. So the whole thing ends a trivial and gentle confection, and I was very sad, including with the comics, and was happy when it ended. Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production. <br /> <br /> Giving to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, though, is amazing as the older couple.
