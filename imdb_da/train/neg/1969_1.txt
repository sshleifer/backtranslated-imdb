Just watched this movie, and I have to say that although some effort was being made to produce a decent movie at first, it was terrible - but not in the sense that it was certain, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> It was as if a child led this insult to intelligence with the conviction that everyone would be seer, morons OR extremely very up for entertainment OR both .... Thank God for fast forward! I can't imagine the kind of viewer the producer had in mind when making this movie. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit hardly, and a script crying for an overall rewrite .... I just can't say more. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror movies, it would be a good bet. <br /> <br /> If you found this movie entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek guidance on the purpose of the movie. There is much better ticket out there. Join a Club, READ RESERVATIONS, but above all, avoid crap like that.
