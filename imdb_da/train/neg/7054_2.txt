This film was completely pathetic. A pitiful manuscript and lack of stories just left me seeing three losers choking over bikini babes. At times I felt like I saw an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi drawers, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not at all impressive. Celina Jaitley wasn't bad. The only worthy part of the movie is spear on Anu Malik and his obsession with shayaris. It was pretty fun. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesn't have a good script from Bhatts to back him up this time.
