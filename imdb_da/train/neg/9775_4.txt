Fine performances and artistic directions are not a good film production. This movie is so gloomy and depressing, I could feel absolutely no joy at the "happy" end in involving the union move. Attempts at humor involving the lake's pregnancy are completely disastrous, and any movie involving a Baldwin brother already has a strike against it. Along a positive note, Lang is still one of America's great undervalued actors, he alone makes it almost worth keeping in the VCR. I give this a 4.
