I saw this movie not really expecting much, I got it in a package of 5 movies, all of which were pretty awful in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what i was right, they were all awful, this movie has a few (and a few stretches it) interesting points, occasionally the camcorder is a good touch, drummer is much like a drummer, ie. damn annoying and it is actually just so boring that i can just assume an attempt to build tension, a lot of nothing happens and when it makes it completely boring (i had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready for to print most of the movie, but gave it a head start) and seriously, the leading singer of the band is so good, they do not say half about how beautiful he is a hell lot, I haven't even mentioned the killer, I don't even go into it, it's just not worth explaining. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned about Star and London, is just about the only reason to see this and except London (which was actually quite fun) it wasn't because of their acting talent, I've certainly seen much worse, but I have also seen much better. Best avoid unless you're bored to see paint dry.
