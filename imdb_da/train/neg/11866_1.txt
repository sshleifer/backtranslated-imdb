First up on this movie, according to the lick it said it won "best movie" at the "Worldfest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. Wouldn't call this the worst movie ever, but it certainly sucks, is pretty much as terrible as other Aussie B degrees "Body Melt", but at least that movie didn't look like it was shot on HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I guess the filmmakers, so many Troma movies and really bad B grade gore movies, and thought they could also break into the business that releases this movie. Don't understand me, I really love low-rated movies. Just the fact that some of the characters put fake American accents almost as if it would give them more chance to sell it in the States or something. Really disappointing end too, the showdown could have been much more exciting and some good fight scenes. You can completely see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "bad taste" with the whole car explosion, rocket launcher, and endless amounts of people being shot down, but the final lacks any top humor or style as "bad" taste. <br /> <br /> If you like to see really bad gore movies or are interested in non-budget filmmaking, watch it, otherwise stay away.
