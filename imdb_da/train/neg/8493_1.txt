Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada, I'm still in awe that a group of people would spend so much time making such a horrible movie. Nobody should see this movie in the hope of learning anything about the consequences of Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or product of her efforts. Likewise, no one should watch this movie in the hope of being entertained. <br /> <br /> As a sci-fi movie, this would no doubt be a terrible failure. Somehow, the protagonist manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on his personal computer - with advice and encouraging words from Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seemingly absurd. As a drama film, this would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the author / instructor manages to take forty-five minutes of constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama over virtually nothing. I doubt anyone could feel that all the drama in the movie only serves as an annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances under which I saw it forbid me to leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would otherwise have. I'm still angry that I wasted the time it took to see it. Only in order to more effectively criticize this film, I wish I was more articulate.
