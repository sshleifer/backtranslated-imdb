Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, return to this much less Universal Horror offer. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as comic sidekick "Babe", we get Fuzzy Knight to replace as a silly buddy named "Stuff". But the results are not so near as charming, and the scare level is almost zero. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of ​​spearing a treasure hunt on a remote island inside an eerie old castle. Peggy is one of the gangs who come together for the trip. But there is a tall and thin John Carradine lookalike in a black cloak and great hat known as "The Phantom" who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune itself. <br /> <br /> This "phantom" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to try to keep its rather average guy face in the shadows to create tension or spookiness. It is always nice to see Perky Moran, but otherwise you can criticize this as one of Universal's immediate forgetful misfires.
