First, a technical review. The script is so slow, it's really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. "Acting" is pathetic, they really seem to have lifted schoolchildren outside the class to read a few lines from an idiot board. As for the whole "point" of history, namely "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) Is really non-existent. Outside "shock" lets them and get great publicity "scene no one would talk about this movie. It is so bad that it actually enables me to think about what better things the money used could have been. Believe me I've seen some bad "emperor's new clothes" movies, but the only thing I can say to them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled under two scenes in this! Read all the other reviews - Avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
