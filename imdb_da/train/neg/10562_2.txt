This very low budget comedy creator movie only succeeds in being low budget. Dialogue is dumbfoundingly silly, chase scenes are uniformly boring, and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot in the last five minutes of the movie (a short flash port-a-potty early in it scene is sure to destroy and vomit crap on the movie's top villain - no prop is here without a purpose). The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those who occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he wanted to give a first-time director a few bucks and a camera - but without the discipline, Corman would impose.
