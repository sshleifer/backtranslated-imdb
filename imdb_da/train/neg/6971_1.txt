All this terrible waste of the needs of the film is Count Floyd, who pops up every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn't get in five miles, about eight miles, of a real movie. Ladies suck this thing. There is no original line, thought, shot or effect from the brainless opening order to the brainless proximity. The magical, ethereal Susan Anspach of five simple pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. Usually it is in the opening credits - "Posted, Directed, and produced by" a guy. Or in the center of the action, some bimbo are so talented that you know there is one and only reason why this turkey was made. Here you will not find the very first of the credits, where the cooperation with about half a dozen sub-functions from the Canadian government is appreciated. <br /> <br /> Right now I see MST's tag on the Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.
