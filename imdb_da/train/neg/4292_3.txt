I like to watch Burt Lancaster's movie - especially when he has to go with his impressive screen presence as in Elmer Gantry. But his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally his greatest weakness as he rarely taught anything. And this is the lack of subtlety that really prevents The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his magic is completely inexplicable. She must be smart, but it doesn't work like that when Lancaster's blarney is thrown around the screen! In addition, the story is perhaps one of the most staggy-looking movies I've ever seen, and it's all too obvious that this is a movie based game. It just looks like it was mostly filmed at a sound stage instead of in the big, wide open west as it should be. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very overrated movie.
