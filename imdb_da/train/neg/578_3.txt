This is not a good movie. The action is remarkably stiff and convincing. The movie does not seem to know if it goes for a real horror approach or to go down to the camp and kitschruten. I have never seen the first movie, but this one does not stand up to its own merits, there are more convincing plots, and the viewer never becomes aware of the importance of the leading female vampire. Not worth looking at
