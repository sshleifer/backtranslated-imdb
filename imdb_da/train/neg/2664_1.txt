Distasteful cliched thriller has young couple doing cross-country research on America's most notorious murder sites, becoming road partners with a weak young woman and her spinning boyfriend - who is a real psycho. Arty and alienating, the tone of the film alternates between pouty pseudo-irony and stupid flamboyance. Practically made perhaps, but ultimately ridiculous. Brad Pitt's performance as the low assassin is godly. * from ****
