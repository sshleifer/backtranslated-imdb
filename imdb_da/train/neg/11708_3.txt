blowing my heart how this movie was made. I saw it while I was working at home writing emails and answering the phone - I just looked at it because I hoped the "revenge" part would be good. Needless to say, the revenues and the forced plots were not worth email when they were seen. In fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end anymore. The play was as bad as the re-enactment scenarios on the "FBI Files" show - by far, the worst re-enactments (really only "Arrest and Trial" may be just as bad at re-determination). I didn't even know that the leading man was in Third Eye Blind until I saw the movie up here on IMDb, but it's obvious why he hasn't made any movies since. I hope he is a good singer.
