Three story lines and not enough to tie them together, "Inside Man" was much jumping and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though they had their moments, the movie began to look like a fast thriller that quickly grounded into a slow crawl, jumped quickly between heights and lows, barely carrying steam again in the last 20 minutes. I want to give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his role extremely well with a full understanding of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with her duality as "evil genius" and "criminal mastermind" (both not the same in retrospect). Overall, each person created a large sub-section. But when the parts finally came together and everything rained, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or summation of everything. It all ended up with very little of the energy it started with, with many plot holes, lots of questions, and as I said earlier, not how close to Spike Lee's normal level. I totally disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the movie they play it to be.
