Okay, this movie f * ck in 'rules. It is undoubtedly one of the most technically scary pieces of cinema ever made. absolutely terrible, but you can see it. Rent this with your friends and bring a drinking game or just have fun, it's fun. And behind-the-scenes featurette proves it, you can do something with paper plates and finger paint. fantastic. okay, just rent it for this scene: two characters actually go in place for approx. 3 minutes in a shot. the director (on the comment) says "yes, tracking was so smooth it seems they are ...". Yes, right man, they go completely in place. it is so funny.
