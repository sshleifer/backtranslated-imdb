Although I had heard that this movie was a bit dry, I see what Scott Bakula is in. At the start of this movie, I had great hopes for the classic cheesy but comfortable Scott-gets girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going well. Plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very smart. I kept my fingers crossed that it would work, and it would all be a terrible misunderstanding until the credits rolled and I realized there would be no happy and happy end. Unfortunately, I was abandoned that I had seen it and hastened to make a quantum leap to restore my faith in Great Scott's goodness!
