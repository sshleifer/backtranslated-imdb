You've seen it at all when Harry met Sally, so avoid this. It will not only make you turn your head on the table because why not bollywood itself make a good remake; But also annoy you with the so-called fun moments in it. The film's charm is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif is trying to act as if he was a play by an actor. The plots that are taken from the original also do not seem to be effective. The part where they both bring their friends together and they make a note does not seem to be appealing. What could be more disastrous? You will waste some money, this is what you can get. Otherwise, put some more money and see the original. It's too good to miss ..
