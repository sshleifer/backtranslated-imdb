In the standard view, this is a purely horrible movie. However, it is an almost perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. I can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as I watched this movie. Andy Griffith's ghost dressed in Indian garbage dancing sends me to hysteria every single time. I wouldn't waste the gas or energy that drove to the video store to rent it, but if you happen to be lying on the sofa at 3 in the morning and it comes on TV, check it out.
