Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal stable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headaches that induce jerky zooms, maximum signs walking around in the forest, do nothing. Until the time flashes on the screen at. 12:01, you can fast forward and miss something, as there are three hunters that we know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the film has some string music that was interesting, so maybe a music video would be the way to go here. Unfortunately, it was not to be, and what should have been a twenty-minute card stretched beyond belief. Forget "Trigger Man" I know I'm trying to. - NOTE
