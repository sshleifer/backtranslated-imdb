I have nothing against a fast-paced flick, but this Stephen King-derived nonsense is for the fresh scrub, too bright and modern. The reason for a new teenage boy in a small town that is a "Sleepwalker" - a kind of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - feeding on female virgins, calls for a more mysterious, ambiguous treatment. This thriller is given an inappropriate colorful look and with almost no atmosphere. The children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, from "Ghost Story", never broke out of the filler form, and it is a huge loss that she has not been used any more. Her performance is frightening and intense, and hints that "Sleepwalkers" may have been a much better movie with a different focus and tighter direction. It's too over-the-top and commercially driven, with an uneven tone that turns wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, like real-time directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
