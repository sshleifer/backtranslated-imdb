The only thing that kept me vomited after watching this movie was that they are only actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the TV show. This is also the main reason why fans of the TV show do not like the movie, but the only reason. This movie has about as much entertainment as getting a root canal. It approaches the deep depth of poor film making, and gets worse. I will not waste your time describing this movie in more detail; Suffice it to say that I take care of the poor camera people who may suffer by looking at this first time.
