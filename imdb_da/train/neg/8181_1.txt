I went to watch this movie (actually I went to see family portraits containing cut moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina) ... I just couldn't see it! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and looking every once in a while. When it was over, my stomach was up and down, and I easily felt my head. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd card began (BTW, of course I wasn't the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. I just don't understand how to love that kind of movie! The shocking and bloody and horrible pictures I saw were really stuck in my head just like for two days !! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw it all and told me it) and I just don't think it makes sense. I think the amount of violence and things do nothing but try to shock people. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least" x "thing about it was good". But well, I think I never understand that kind of movie.
