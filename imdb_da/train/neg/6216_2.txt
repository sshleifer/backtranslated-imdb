9, the movie I've been looking forward to for months .... was a little more than a disappointment. I was deeply surprised at 9's lack of history and strange character development. All the amazing action sequences in the world do not constitute a single unsympathetic character. <br /> <br /> The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly turn to a necromonomic horror wannabe with mysterious symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of responding to what might have been extremely scary story devices ?? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why .... questions that you ask only ask if you care, and you will be less and less likely to go away from the theater. <br /> <br /> A movie like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth. I would see this movie drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burton's name to pull the audience. Which ... is what penetrated me, but failed to respect me. 9 could have been fantastic ... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from their own creators.
