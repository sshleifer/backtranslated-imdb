Short version: Seeds are not worthless. It's just derivative and inferior. And rarely. <br /> <br /> Long Version: If you've never seen any of the movies that include the vaguely defined "psychological horror" genre, this movie will probably melt your face away. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening of true animal cruelty will suffice to open the eyes to opportunities for brutality on video, and the (only) memorable doing scene later in the movie may be more than you can handle. The Climax will play with your feelings in a way that may not have any other movie. <br /> <br /> But that's if you don't have much experience with the genre. If you've seen the right thing ... "August Underground's Penance", for example, as I did, you will find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared this with video nasties of old. I understand this comparison. Like video nasties, "Seed" is more fierce than a mainstream horror movie and less subtle. But the reason why video supports are still known to us is not just for the above reasons - those who are still popular had something special. Allow me to be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who are stuck have "soul". Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Cemetery", on an interview on the new DVD: "... we will never have more movies like these, for today technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold. So many things will disappear because small films like these are no longer produced, today we have large, extraordinary tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold, today a horror movie costs more than a million dollars. expensive ... they are real effects, made with our hands ". <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison with old school horror so seriously. But Crisanti has hit the nail on his head. Even at their most seemingly exploitative, the best of video nasties pursued a primitive "truth". And this is where Boll falls short. It's as if he's seen the movies and didn't understand them. Everything on the checklist is there ... BS about "making a statement about humanity", an indecent torture scene, etc. But it is as Crisanti puts it "cold". Gore is all CGI. It all feels like scenes pieced together from other films of different genres. And the pacing is so slow. Man, so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the one doing scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough BS. Weak film.
