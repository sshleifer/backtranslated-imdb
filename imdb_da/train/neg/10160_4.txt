A typical Lanza flick who had limited the audience appealed to a weak line of history that was put together to justify Lanza's MGM contract at that time. As reported by Lastliberal member (above), Grayson could not stand Lanza because of her obscene progress toward her (and sometimes on) the camera. In addition, his gutter and the continuous smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were unacceptable. After making their second (and last) movie together, "Toast of New Orleans", it usually stormed Grayson quietly into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him in no uncertain word that she would never work with Lanza again ?? period. Mayer thought Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's statement stumbled. Grayson continued to star in a number of widely received (and far more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when asked to compare Lanza and Keel, she replied that there was no comparison between them and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the "real people" in the audience.
