This subordinate successor based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) relates to a spouse named Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from a monastery. Gene York re-elected Congressman and he heads the Finance Committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths occur. She creates destruction when a metaphysical fair is going on, as shops of numerology, therapy, counseling cure, yoga, tarots, among other things are destroyed. Karen York hires an eye privately (Michael Lerner) to investigate the weird and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This television sequel shows excitement, chills, creepy events and gory kill. Delia like Damien seems to be sending new mischievous murders every few minutes with horrific killings. The greatest excitement lies in seeing what is new and innocent victim that can be created by the intermediate special effects. In addition, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, but nice cast secondary, like Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser, and the recently deceased Don S Davis, turned into an army captain to act. As always, excellent musical scores are taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is exclusively for hardcore followers Omen saga. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Earlier and much better versions are as follows: The extremely superior original 'Omen' (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; 'Damien' (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; "Final conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: Below average.
