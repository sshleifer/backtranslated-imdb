The social comment was far-blown, and the mystery itself was built and resolved through a series of incomparable coincidences that were absolutely incredible. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the last decade, making it extremely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had difficulty understanding why he complained about his stay in Australia compared to the possibilities of solving mysteries he has in England. Can't he insinuate himself on the Australian police? It looks like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation. <br /> <br /> The latter episodes in the original series were rather melodramatic and unreliable, sometimes bordering on misery, and one picking up the mantle rather than returning to focus in series one. Sad.
