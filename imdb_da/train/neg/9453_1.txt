Holy Cow, what a piece of this movie is. I didn't do how these filmmakers could take a 250 dictionary and make it a movie. I guess they don't even think I can't remember any speed or bend in the book, do you? <br /> <br /> They constantly took the child's classic, added some farting, bowed and sexually inuindo and prostitute it for a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers like. I have to say visually, it was interesting, but the brilliant visual history is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that things are fun) I will NOT have the kids as I know it is. <Br /> <br /> Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD. I hope the ghost from Doctor Sue's ghost comes and haunts the people who made this movie.
