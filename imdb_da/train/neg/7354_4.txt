As a Hammer finisher, I was afraid of the time when I had to travel the courage to watch this movie and the subsequent Holiday on the Buses. I had seen the One the Buses movie and thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was filled with all the horrible comedy that plagued British television screens around the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this movie that I laughed at. I do not know if it was because I was now familiar with the signs and enjoyed some of the situations and knew how to react. I found Blakey especially funny, although I could swear at no time in the trilogy, he says his phrase: "I get you Butler". <br /> <br /> Having seen Holiday on the Buses, the jokes began to wear thin, and these three films were comparable to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, as the second movie is the best (although it is probably the only way they can be compared). <br /> <br /> Only people who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series who will undoubtedly enjoy this and Hammer finishers like myself. For the finishers I would say that this film is not so bad and I can certainly think of worse Hammer comedies.
