The "Documentary", and we use the term seemingly loose, summarizes that Muslims are trying to take over the world tremendously. So say that any Muslim who does not admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face! Also, every person interviewed in the movie has found a market for their ridiculous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others think of them. What the West needs to know is that this is nothing but propaganda directed at mental midgets. If you are looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I will look elsewhere. Try something that gives more views from qualified sources.
