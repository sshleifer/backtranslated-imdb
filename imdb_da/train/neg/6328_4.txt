Why does this movie fall well below standards? In the end, the answer lies in the poor, humorous script. A slender / transparent Travolta (looks a little brave in black, I have to say, even with a big mole) and Gross both seem very good as two young-ish 'dressed-dressed' yet dimwitted New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub . Apart from that, the rest of the movie is just boring to see. It is so boring that it really is not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax at any level. Of course, Kelly Preston exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is very fun to watch as struggling with the KGB honcho "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the movie would have been better if the plot was changed slightly so the settings did not change from NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you will understand if you see the movie. .. Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release. I suppose Paramount was about to release the film in January 1989 because of the incredible plot. It was reported that they considered it "unreleasable". Nevertheless, this $ 6 million movie got a bit over an embarrassing $ 163,000 in revenue as it was only released briefly in places like Texas and Colorado before going straight to video. This is the testament to the overall BAD quality of this movie.
