Was it a thriller I thought when I saw the deck of the video library? No. Was it a 'food for thought' when the author tried to do it? Not really. So what was that? It was a very average movie that had great potential and was nicely directed, but let down by a confusing story without strong points that began between and end, with bad action expected from the serial guy who, although he seemed to be unmanageable on Some points provided the best performance of the overall cast. It was great movie, with good colors, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenes, but left you lost about where it goes and where it has just been. And with a sense of being just let's pick it up at the end. OK to see if there is nothing else on TV.
