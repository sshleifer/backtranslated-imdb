What on earth has become of our dear Ramu? Is it the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped from the high cliff he has risen by giving industry some of the greatest works of all time. This film is made to fall like a brick. I skated to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit because I would not have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others went too. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit out of range. <br /> <br /> This movie is not far from Sholay. It doesn't even come close to it within a mile. I think Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, as Sarkar was a classic work. I read Ramu's interview a few days back, where the interviewer said Ramu didn't sleep for more than 4 hours a day, not even on a stretch. I totally agree with this now that his lack of sleep has probably taken his toll on the film. <br /> <br /> There is no power in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary. He looked more scary in the few posters and backgrounds I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have many dialogues (in fact no one if I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this movie and found somewhere in history. The new guy who plays Jai's role seems to have the brash look, but failed to do Jai's role at all. I can't continue ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to do right now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the movie that I will see the original Sholay once again to see that it is still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Horrible movie. The media and critics must prepare Ramu's goose. And to remind all readers again, I'm one of the greatest Ramu fans, and even I can't spare him this action.
