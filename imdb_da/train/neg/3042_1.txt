I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this movie, but a word may be bizarre. Hubby and I didn't laugh as much as gawk on this really horrible movie. We kept looking at each other with our best "What ...?" expression. There is no way to adequately describe this film. Killer tomatoes were fun, but it's just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind does innocent children include in this weird, strange movie and packs it as if it suits children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him / her see this movie. Preteens can see it - probably with "What ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to apply this movie to others, you may want to spike their egg yolk. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst movie ever made.
