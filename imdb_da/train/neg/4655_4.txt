I wanted to give the Drawing Blood the benefits of the original doubt. Opening hours with a naked woman sprawled out and a painter, Diana, about painting her and then sucking her blood to clean out so she can use it for her art, giving the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy- vampire flick. Appears that this first impression turns out to be false. Oh, Troma, marked by some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they will offer something that is rubbish bin, but fun and at least some competence for the junk food vessel (or sometimes not). This is a case where it is not even fun to watch as its attempt at humor (ie, the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian that makes Jimmy Durante impressions?) Is weak at best, and any unintentional grin is undercut by Sergio Lapel's bargain basement direction. <br /> <br /> And it is not without him to try, oh Lord no. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for light, but the way they were used in the film, I, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, crumbled in my seat: if I saw this in a theater, I would blind my eyes to many and wonder if his DP really understood the basic 3-point lighting setup. Although this, along with a very noisy sound design (or just lots of random high humming as in the art gallery), should not be something that comes to attention during a Troma release, it should be somewhat * basic * that a filmmaker can tackle though The script is not very funny or scary (and it is not) or if the lapel makes a strange mix of songs placed in bizarre moments. It's not a good movie with any stretch, and maybe if you're a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period), it may have some appeal as a low-lease cellar alternative to Near Dark, or as a little improvement over, say 1972's Blood Freak. You have better ways to waste your time everywhere.
