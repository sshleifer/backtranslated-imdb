Sorry Fulci fans, but I couldn't get through this. The soundtrack was just as annoying as they were, the play was puerilt, the story was done and done, and the direction was non-existent. <br /> <br /> Massacre honestly looks like a children's movie project. But I've seen some of them and they actually look better than they did! It seems to have been so underfunded that they could not afford ... anything! Not a DoP, not a director, no one who even removed had a clue as to what was acting. It was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> It was about the worst sucking party I've seen next to Terror Toons, the only one to Killer Klowns from outer space. I have nothing else to say about it. <br /> <br /> It bets a 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
