Since its release in 1983, "Julestory", the Jean Shepherd narrated story of his alter-ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. However, "My Summer Story" still has Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely no charm, and the characters are not near the caliber of the original movie. "My Summer History" is basically a mishmash of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories that include hillbilly neighbors and fighting peaks. Charles Grodin, who I usually like, is extremely unlikely in the father's role (more appropriately handled by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never works other than forced. Kiernan Culkin is a bad replacement for Ralphie, and the little brother is anything but forgotten here. Only mother seems to have something here and maybe because it is because she is praying a cinema manager with a sleeper boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on "free dish night". <br /> <br /> The stories in this are mostly inconsistent and stretched paper thin. Can appeal to the highly exhilarating, but as a sequel to "A Christmas story" it is a very poor and not worthy to most people. 2 out of 10
