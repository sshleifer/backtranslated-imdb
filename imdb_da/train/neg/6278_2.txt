You have to ask how some flics are ever made ... this one decided to skip with why among many other things and just wander over the moot. <br /> <br /> And yet, you have a number of decent actors who do their best to pump some life into the story. The blue tint throughout the film overshadows 'once again', which in itself would be depressing, but here it is overkill. The idea that it is not a medical condition, no house or a gypsy or a snooping curse, but just something that, for no apparent reason, begins to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her, becomes as much as to take a big snout out of an empty mug. Some doppelgangers have super powers, but others don't or don't they know? It seems that they are as clever as we are. It is a poor man's rip-off of "Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" with Keifer Sutherland's "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense", where you must seriously tie the three together.
