Although 99.99% of the people who have seen this movie are Brazilian, I will stop with English as it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. Worst play I've seen in a loooong time. The kids are horrible. Especially the boy. This was the first time I saw a person with less facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a single voice tone, like a 5-year-old boy reading in front of the class. How can anyone so bad be the movie's main role? The story is so superficial that my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple that it could be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes. There are only three options to enjoy any of this movie: 1) You are a pre-teen; 2) You have been so brainwashed by Globo's stupidity that you believe that everything that has Globo's seal is amazing; 3) You have a serious brain injury. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! A shame for the Brazilian movie scene.
