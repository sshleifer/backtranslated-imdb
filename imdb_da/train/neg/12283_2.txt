College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is plagued by nightmares by a cellar-dwelling ghoul at Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his own hand, spitting up a worm, a ghoul ripping opens his chest and being burned over an open fire. After his friends see him levitating "6 feet" over his bed, a helpful, occult-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests that they slip into Alcatraz to meet his fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is out to help when things go loose! <br /> <br /> The group gets stranded, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) gets obsessed and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil of "Mickey" fame appears as the helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, leading singer of the "Bodybag" group. She teaches Alex how to live out of his body and dance a rock music with resumed nightmare footage to throw off the maturity. All victims are shown as wisecracking ghosts a la Griffin Dunne character in an American werewolf in london. The script is full of plot holes, cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy. Good FX work and cool opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that win any profit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") do some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
