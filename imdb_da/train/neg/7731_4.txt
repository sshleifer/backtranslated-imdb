The comparison may be unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted to the intimacy and depth of the umbrellas will be a bit appalled at discovering a cut-and-paste American-style musical - awkward, stuttered dialogue with unexplained song and dance songs. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so bad that a terrible job of dubbing was replaced (as you will remember, the duplication was almost entirely drawn in Umbrellas). The translation of French (for subtitle versions) also gives something to be desired, although it cannot be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-conscious moments that come out of a wild confusion, as references in songs to LeGrand itself. And the costumes - well, the tight pants / white boots combination, and the freakish unnatural colors, are reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with allusions to umbrellas; note, for example, the suitcase worn by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase that was worn by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the "convenient Brunette of Resolution" - Madeleine in Umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. Generally, they expect the natural feelings of umbrellas (save the cycle cycle) or look for similar deeper issues and ambiguous endings as in the umbrella's script should probably pass this one. Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be pretty happy.
