This title seems more like a movie exercise than a movie that should have been released to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife it has been fun to work together in a movie for the first time without taking into account that people could actually see it. I felt it was 90min wasted when I waited eagerly for a plot to develop or even begin. <br /> <br /> Try customizing this movie to a genre and you don't want it missing a beginning, middle or ending. I've seen "arty" movies before, and it doesn't even come close to being artistic, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself when the only people who rated this movie were 10 under the age of 18. No doubt the constant meaningless erotic scenes that the film was insisting on throwing at us. That's if you can call it erotic. It certainly did not taste.
