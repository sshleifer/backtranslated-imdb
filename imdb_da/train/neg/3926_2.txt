This Italian film is basically a soap opera with skin. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was rated "R" but on the actual tape inside said it was "X." The latter makes much more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark you could see Dutch actor Marishcka Detmers performing all sex on this guy - and yes, you could see his penis in his mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "mainline actress" had done something like this on the screen. Detmer parades around in nude on several scenes, but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly .... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite Detmer's appearance.
