I do not know who Sue Kramer, who is the director of this movie, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she is a lesbian and B) she was somehow ashamed of everyone involved in this project to participate to prove that they are not homophobic. br /> I can imagine everyone thinking, "My God, it's terrible. Not fun. Pedestrian. Totally paralyzing." But keep their mouths shut for fear that they will be labeled anti-gay or they "don't get" gay lifestyle. (That's probably why Kramer didn't throw gay people to play gay.) It's not even worth going through. The actors are all geared to playing each scene all over the top, so there is no sincerity or credibility in anything they do. It's full of clich√©s, and there's nothing about this movie that's the least fun - much less fun. I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. The bad people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb were not as inappropriate in their judgment.
