This sequel is thoroughly uneven, incoherent and rambling in the "plot" (if really one) and is trying to condemn hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of time and character 21st century style songs dominate) and sweet (gab: that's too Many produced, belaboured jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the young plot. Even Glenn Close (and she's usually very good) sweeps through this movie, parading as the original De Ville and the leader of Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that's not even good to watch. This is a very good example of a poor and meaningless successor. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterization and acceptable play. It doesn't. It's bad.
