I had to leave the theater. After one hour, all I saw was people cheating on wives, schtupping like dogs in a debris and using the f-word as a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any of the characters could have been quite interesting if they got more to do than haughty, talk about it and swear to each other. <br /> <br /> The few times it looked like there was some kind of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. Plot development in 1st hour can be summarized as 1) More murders occur 2) Vinnie sees murder scene 3) Vinnie stares mood over the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on wife and 5) Joey (most sympathetic character in the show) gets kicked out of his parents' house. More than that I didn't expect to see. <br /> <br /> Shooting and interaction between the characters was excellent, but there was nothing for them to do. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting an hour for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption. Either is a better study in societal and interpersonal relationships.
