A horrible pointless and worse, boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no signs beyond the most imaginative stereotypes, and builds on a lumpy central concept that is neither particularly original nor handled in a vaguely innovative way. Will Ferrell is wasted in it, he probably hoped to be his answer to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replaces his usual calling routine (albeit very fun if you discount Talledega Nights) for, yes, pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is no more than mildly annoying (some reviews I've read here speak for an Oscar nomination are ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does an acceptable job with a very weak script that doesn't allow anything in addition to establishing its character as a former law student who fell out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked to make people happy. Please. That she ended up falling to Ferrell's 'character' is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempt to jazz up the movie using computer graphics serves only to highlight the uninspired material he has to work with. <Br /> <br /> I had the choice to either watch The Prestige for the third time or see it. I wish I had chosen The Prestige.
