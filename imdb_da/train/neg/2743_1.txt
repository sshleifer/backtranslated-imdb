I have to admit that I didn't finish this movie because it was so incredibly stupid and not worth seeing. I saw it with a room full of children who also didn't laugh at the stupid and raw humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with the sphincter and genitals that it overrides the real story I grew up with. THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Besides the content being so raw, the movie is just stupid, has poor power and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, don't waste your time watching a movie that hits it so badly that it hurts you. Buy your kids book instead.
