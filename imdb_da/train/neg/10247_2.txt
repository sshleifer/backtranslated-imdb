This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's terrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he is hardly in it, the only good part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped seeing it close to the end, it was so bad, only for hard-hitting b-movie fans who have the brain to stand up.
