Although I am generally advocating the well-crafted movie, I do not limit myself to movies that escape those limits, and more often than I do not enjoy and admire movies that successfully "break the rules". And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any real point. Pasolin's work is visually devastating, but it is less of a question of what is actually on the screen than how it is the movie, and his movie's slump seems to be less of a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur movies. This applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and although many directors have done so with remarkable results, non-actors tend to remain non-actors under Pasolini's direction. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often contains pictures designed to shock, insult or otherwise disturb the audience. Such elements can often be used with sensational effect, but in Pasolin's hands, such elements rarely appear to contribute anything to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I've got to understand that there are many people who like, even admire Pasolinis movies. Yet I have never really met any of them, and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that created the reason for such a taste or admiration that I understand. If he judges alone from his works, I believe that he was essentially an amateur director who does not choose the rules as much as lack of skills - and who was initially applauded by his intelligentsia for "existential boldness," and thus simply confirms him in bad habits as a film producer. I find his work boring, unimpressive and pretentious. And this also applies to DECAMERON. Unfortunately, it is true for virtually all Pasolini films, it has been my misfortune to endure.
