I work my way through Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and The WITCHES MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las Brujas) is something like the 17th film in the set. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to keep my attention at all. The reason was incoherent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The action was poor. The signs were unsympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an enchanted woman driven to burn her seemingly bratty daughter. The only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie, however, is the main character, Mario, who has the most amazing string ever. But it is. <br /> <br /> The movie was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It's hardly easy to see - what more can I say?
