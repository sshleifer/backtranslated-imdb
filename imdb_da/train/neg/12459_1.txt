Given how much money was budgeted for this movie, you would expect more from the story as a whole. This might be the most worthless movie I've ever seen. There was no real progress for anything. Character development, minimal. Plot progress, maybe. Enjoyment, none. I'm not sure which points even tried to be made. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are good good, American CIA bombs everything that is not in line with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt and you like to see something resembling a narrative listing accompanied by a death, has on. For those of us who realize that it doesn't kill a good guy to make a point, we stick to other movies. In summary, this was a terrible attempt at an "Ocean's 11" style that is hidden from the person who is forced to think, because not only do you know what is happening, nobody made the movie either. Home Alone 3 was a better movie piece.
