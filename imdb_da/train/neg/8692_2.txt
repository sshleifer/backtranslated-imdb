I think Elisabeth Rohm, although she might be trying hard, is not very good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she might have been the only one they could get at that price. I saw it primarily for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most trustworthy and undoubtedly the most convincing to see. When he wasn't on the screen, the case went dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the cribs, but be sure he is really a friendly, fun compassionate man. He even said to play the role that gave him the cribs. <br /> <br /> I want to see something with him, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as a lint on law and order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
