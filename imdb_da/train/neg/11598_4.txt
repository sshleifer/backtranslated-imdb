Looking back at another bad nightmare sequel like Freddy's Revenge, at least give it some credit to try something new. And even though The Dream Child is easier, it definitely doesn't offer anything new to the series. Yes, there are the creative deaths as usual as a child becomes part of a cartoon and faces "Super Freddy", but even scenes that way are not used to their full potential, and parts without Freddy are just boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of the scariness of the series. Freddy seems to be the comical relief now ... but for what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
