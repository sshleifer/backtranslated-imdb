This was one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. A college child has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at Alcatraz. Trying to deliver a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80's music video, this movie is stuck with bad acting and an exhaustive slow moving story. Although it is such a bad and often ridiculous movie (digging them mullets and the horrible dialogue), it would be good material to fall for an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack or that Tony Basil has a role in the film. It's a huge catastrophe, although with a little cult follows (see the other IMDb comments on this movie).
