I picked this up in the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you don't like this then go by yourself!") On the box ... seemed like a ringing endorsement .... I expected something a bit more like "Death Proof "... not much actual violence in this one or in plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. That's all there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. A week or so in the life of an LA band making a crappy magic show on a level that you might want to see in one of the smaller casinos from the strip and an Australian stuntman who is new to the city find his feet ... They work, they meet girls, they party. The end of the story. Of course, the band needs all the things because they are honestly second class and play a style that was already dated in 1978. It must be said that the stunt bits in the film are really spinetling - that the Aussie guy really is something, and the film seems big seen motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung it there to see what crazy things he would do next time. Just wish he could have found a better vehicle.
