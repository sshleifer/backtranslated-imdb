You know what kind of movie you come into when the serial killer's main character is transported to the electric chair (in what seems to be a bakery truck), to only get the jail wagon colliding with (and I don't make this up) a genetic tanker. The goo that runs forward melts him and melts his DNA with the snow and creates our protagonist, the killer's snowman. My favorite part of the movie, however, is an over-shoulder of the snowman beating some poor schmuck in, where his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white oven-potholder gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
