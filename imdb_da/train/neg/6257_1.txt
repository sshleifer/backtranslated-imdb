SPOILERS. Strange people with generous taste have reviewed this movie. Allow me to add balance by pointing to the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Terrible. When Tom and Dan are "getting to know each other," talking about movies, is clearly speaking to a person, and I suppose it was the director who worked his words carefully to sound intelligent. At one point, Dan asks, "Have you heard of the HIV virus?" and it sounds as natural as asking: "Have you communicated with the nine strangers?" Acting: White teeth do and a scalloped face does not make a sensitive performer. Speedman did well enough for what he got, I suppose, but Marsden was horrible - unsympathetic, unbelievable and beautifully smuggled throughout his captivity. There is emptiness for his performances (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Save Me! The half-flight moments were not exciting, but annoying and weak. Remember Marsden pretending to try the keys in the door and then throwing them down: "They're not working, man!" Tea hee. And watch out for the half-black-and-white flashbacks initiated with a bit of silly sound taken from CSI and other criminal dramas. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, most dangerous, evil and offensive are homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a movie where HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan may have taken a condom or not used it at all - excuse me where was Tom while having sex? There is some villain of the incipient partner who comes as a disgrace of homosexuals in general. <br /> <br /> Overall: Beware!
