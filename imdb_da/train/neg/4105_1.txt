Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise it would get a slight zero. Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, Peckenpah's name was not what I would never have guessed, he did. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco, I know, was a lot on the set, and from almost sunup, he says Sam was just snockered. It shows in spades. The ridiculous bit in the early part of the movie is the only thing in all this mess is another look. Not even Gig Young can be seen. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into a theater's frame to see it, I would have jumped up screaming. And now I feel really guilty of having seen it all from a very comfortable sofa that was just as nice to leave. What a mess it seemed less written than calculated as they went together. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob spelled backwards. Yikes !!!!!
