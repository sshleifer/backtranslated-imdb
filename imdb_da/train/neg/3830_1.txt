I do not know why I take time to review this wasteland. If you keep it long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion ?? good, bad or surprising ?? do not do. It finally attaches to rigid, formal, predictable dialogue and action. Indoor scenes are so heavily lit, you think if the camera was zoomed out a millimeter longer, you will see the clinging lights. Costumes, hair-dos and sets are stiff, pressed and immaculate. Do we imagine that ordinary people really lived in the early 20th century Arizona? Other reviews' comparisons with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least the director wove his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. HARD MEN's gore is free of exploding squibs from wooden characters of evil with manicured nails. Huh?!? I think Heston thought he might have made some of this movie. (He gets to connect his gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he joined this travesty. Want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the western end as we knew them? See the SKOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. The last hard man is a mockery of a death sentence to the West.
