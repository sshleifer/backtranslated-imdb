The first one was different and fun. This trial should never have left the study. This movie doesn't make you laugh. It is a weak attempt at gross humor. The movie selects current and old movies for rip-off. This time, the jokes seem to be used and exaggerated. The audience I saw it only responded to Hannibal's dinner scene and slept otherwise.
