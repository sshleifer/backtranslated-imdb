I saw the unsorted version of this movie and realized in 30 minutes that I never got my time back. In the end, I continued in the hope that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic in the end, the special FX would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I'm a complete gorehound. I number some of the eighties splatter flicks among the movie worlds. However, this was not done in the eighties, if this movie had come out in the early eighties, the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad. It wasn't like that, it doesn't have that defense. The dialogue is horrible with so many bad lines, I was wincing at the writing rather than squirming by torture. I don't like Hostel, never, I thought it was over rated, over hyped and I felt nothing for the main characters, but it shines like a lighthouse to grandeur next to this garbage. The back of the Live Feed cover promised a twist you would never see, I am still waiting for the twist promised.
