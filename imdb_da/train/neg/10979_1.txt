Words can't begin to describe how incredibly horrible this movie is. I wish it was "so bad, it's good," but it's not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who, as a true phrase of vanity, threw himself as the male leader. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> Gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looking. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willing and can act. Even if you can tell that she is holding back. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the supporting man Mark. I've seen less wood in a rainforest, but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep her actors from acting? Is he really so bad an instructor? Everyone else has summed up the story perfectly - there is not one. Children are kidnapped and Kelly steps in to resolve the crime. I know how he felt like stepping into the path, that's how I felt after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was trying to get my money back from the rental shop. This is a home video best to be seen by the instructor's friends (and if you search them out, you'll see that same friends were the one who gave the movie's positive characters).
