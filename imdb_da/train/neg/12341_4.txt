Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century. The road before the series "Scary Movie" was a few examples of this genre, mainly in the 80s. But, as I said, most of these movies are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' are rising mostly over it, but others like 'Saturday the 14th' and it's successor failed to deliver laughs. But out of all these types of movies there is a particularly great offender, and it is 'Transylvania 6-5000', a huge waste of time for many reasons. Benefits: A great cast that does it best. Some of the dopey humor is entertaining. A corny, but catch the theme song. Some good transylvanic places. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Threadable plot. Most boring pacing. Most of the humor doesn't cheat it. The monsters get a little to do and a little screen time. I thought this should be a ghost of monster movies? Lame ends that will probably make the viewers angry. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If so, why are the really funny bits so few and far between? Comedies should make us roll on the floor, not roll our eyes and spawn, pain to be over. I can't believe Anchor Bay has released this tired junk. I admit that it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not worth everybody's time or money, even if you're a fan of some of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
