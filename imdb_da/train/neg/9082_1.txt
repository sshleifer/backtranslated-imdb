This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was fooled into thinking it could be good because a few of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to turn Jason Schwartzman on the face to take this role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I really don't understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in that I'm sure you can glimpse from the top and get the very best. That way, the worst movie you're making is like Ferris Beullar instead of this slam. Gags like the scarf and blatant ripping off jeans advertisements added to the humorlessness of the movie. Glad I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This shows that you should avoid January releases at any cost.
