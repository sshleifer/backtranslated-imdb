Really a wonderful pile of cardboard! <br /> <br /> A predictable, slow-moving, soul-destroying, insane movie where you throw your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems ... well, almost necessary. The action is finished for the thin dialogue, every scene is at least twice as long as it should be, the intricate details of how this career coincides or the career increases are just too sad and everyday for words. The music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie, but really, three good songs aren't enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie I asked God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. Never ever ever again.
