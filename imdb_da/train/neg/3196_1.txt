The only words you need to fear more than Joe Don Baker, if your thinking about watching a movie is Greydon Clark, and if they are both, run for your life. But it's a very funny movie because they actually take themselves seriously! It starts off badly and goes downhill from there, repetitive scenes, the good the bad and the ugly as shooting will make you roll on the floor with laughter. Yes, he is the best deputy sheriff in Texas and traces a mafia hitman to Malta as he can only. He makes his own rules, does things in his own way, constantly wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style. Want to see a bad but fun movie? Go ahead, it's your step!
