I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and pushing it received, but after I saw it I was terribly disappointed. Slum is a totally unfunny movie mixed with a Todd Solondz type disturbing family reality sans Todd's humor. The story draws together, and each scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed the point, but if this movie is an example of every girl's growing experience, I'm happy to be a man.
