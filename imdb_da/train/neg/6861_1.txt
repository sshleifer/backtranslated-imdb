My first exposure to Templarios & not a good one. I was thrilled to find this title among the offers from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us to other cult classics like "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is an exciting opening order where the villagers settle for a terrible revenge on the temples (& get it all started), but everything else in the movie is slow, strange and ultimately unfulfilling. Adds insult to injury: The movie was dubbed, not subtitle, as promised on the video jacket.
