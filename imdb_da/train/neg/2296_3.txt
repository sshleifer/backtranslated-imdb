"Back of Beyond" takes place at a diver diner / petrol station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors arrive unexpectedly. We get what, for the first time, seems confusing as a feedback, where he and his sister (even though their relationship with each other is better understood later in the movie) speeds up the desert on their motorcycle. Subsequently, he looks like a terribly quiet and sometimes moody character in the presence of the arrivals. We know that one thing is safe, and it is McGregor's kind of spiritual sensation, his foresight for danger and such - his clairvoyance is a little relevant to history, the majority of which relate to three diamond thieves whose car breaks down and trusts Tom for to help them out of the way without getting in the way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly it brushes all three who are already suspicious of allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in too much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. Even the end, which plays as a trident story (and one that really reveals many narratives) is almost as ridiculous. It may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but at least for something a little different from the usual.
