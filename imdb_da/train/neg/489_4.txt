The play is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are beautiful, so if you are looking for well-behaved soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise you waste your time. The motivation of the protagonists, especially the eponymous lead, is often a mystery. She could just have told the truth - the truth presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared in rape prison he did not commit. Was she protecting her father, who went off with half-neck, as it was when he suddenly instituted a malicious trial? Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly worrying, as her art only seemed so far? During the trial, this strong will turns to mushe for our eyes. Conversely, her boyfriend, who starts out as a narcissistic jerk, becomes an unselfish hero in the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Of course, since no good deed must go unpunished, we are told that she never sees him again.
