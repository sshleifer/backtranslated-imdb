I can katogoricaly and undoubtedly say that in all my 51 years on this planet, it's the worse (supposibly children's) movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three big kids to see it and even they struggled to raise a smile during the whole tortuous 90 minutes. The sexual indians I will leave another day, but they were as tasteful as the movie. They have to pay you to see what you don't pay them. It's really really awful, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this movie should be tasked with taking money under false neglect. <br /> <br /> Apologies for my spelling mistakes, but I'm so sorry that it spoiled the time I had with my grandchildren Greeting Stephen
