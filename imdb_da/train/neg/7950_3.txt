Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed zero. Unknown to the director's work, I am well acquainted with the filmmaker he presumably praises - Ozu Yasujiro. While not even approaching Ozu in grandeur, he has not communicated anything about Ozo's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. One of the things he totally misses is Oze's attention to character - we are not even "introduced" by Hou to his main character (a perfect blank page). There is no medium or close shot of his people. One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Hou doesn't do - a good look at their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates into something like "Nothing ever happens". It would be a much better title for this meaningless exercise. The whole film gives us a trace of an unclear Taiwanese composer whose work we hear on the soundtrack. But the tracks, like anything else, add nothing. Unless you are a trainer, this movie has nothing to recommend it.
