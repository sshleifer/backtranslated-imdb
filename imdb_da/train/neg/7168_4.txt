The author came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many mistakes in the execution of the plot took so much away from the movie that it could almost make it unmatched. Basic elements such as sign development were at best glossy. Disagreements also reared their ugly head. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Signs that just "appear" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times can I add)? All in all it was not "bad". I rated it a 4, based mainly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
