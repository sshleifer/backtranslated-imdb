Delicious boring movie with charismatic Mercurio wasted completely. Released a moment on a Thursday in perhaps a local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four other BACK OF BEYOND is a project apparently created by a manufacturer seeking a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has morphed into a director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK), and Terry Serio never seems to get a guernsey except for bullies roles. But Paul Mercurio should have been one of Australia's biggest on-screen exports. Roles like this are big disappointments, and movies like this are just a waste of talent and time.
