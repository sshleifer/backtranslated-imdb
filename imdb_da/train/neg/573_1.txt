The last reviewer was very generous. I'm silent as the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this much. The beginning is tolerable, but it goes downhill fairly quickly. I just can't see Jon Bon Jovi as a "bad vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. A lot of scenes just don't make sense. I think any normal person would suspect that something is up when a strange woman suddenly comes out of nothing to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was ever explained in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but it was too much to ask. This should be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen.
