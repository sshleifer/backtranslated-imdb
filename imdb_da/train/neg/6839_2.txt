Twin brothers separated at birth (Due to the death of their parents) are reunited twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel. Double Impact runs in two hours and basically adds no real access to the Corsican Brothers plot and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while it is appropriate that the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother. Also, the action sequences are not that exciting this time, and Jean-Claude is more dependent on the shot than on his martial arts. The support molding is also wasted, and in two hours the film is just blunt. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (bad)
