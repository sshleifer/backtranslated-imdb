I felt compelled to watch the movie all the way through, when I found it in a dealer wagon and bought it for my own, but I came close many times to turn it off and just write the money I paid for it. If you're a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is ok. If there is one thing the creators of this movie know about, it is the creative use of false blood and body parts for a disease-affecting effect. If it doesn't span you, stay away. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot on a home camera, with classroom props and horrible actors. It's dubbed from German, but even that allows the sound to be horrible. This film is about the budget that the budget gets, except for the special effects mentioned above. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and gut, the movie could have been a little more fun. The story is about three men landing on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. They are trapped and the rest of the film is about their attempt to escape. I call this a story in the forefront, as it really is a series of torture scenes and combat struggles assembled with an eerie obscenity-filled dialogue. There is nothing at all redeeming about this movie unless you are mindless. Consider yourself warned.
