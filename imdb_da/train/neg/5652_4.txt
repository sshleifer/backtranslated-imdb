This is not a bad movie ... but that is the type your girlfriend makes you see. The story is not bad .... it just makes one and a half and a half so long. It's hard for me to separate this movie because I really like the idea of ​​it, but it was just too long and thin on the story ... too bad. The protagonist never seems to change everything so much from the beginning to the end. I mean go through some "life change" and he can hardly break a smile. I really thought the Mac was really good. His odd quirkiness kept the movie from being a complete disaster. Maybe I can just "get" this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I would like to be informed.
