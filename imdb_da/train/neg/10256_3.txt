Your mind will not be fulfilled by this no-budget day's thriller; but pray who will it? A young couple spends the real end of the world in the hidden lab of some foreigners who defeat the church's people. <br /> <br /> Small _apocalyptic theme outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar films. And it's not just that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid ?? not only doomsday, but monastery also creeps. The movie's villain is a well-known character actor. This completely shameless slapdash seems like a piece of monastic exploitation, the significant 70's genre that looks so fun outdated today. Anyway, the monastery's secret lab is something uncomfortable piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the world's end of the world; But the end of the world is not at all its pride!
