The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, where a pretentious student makes a movie and cannot determine whether he wants art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the movie he made. I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. But in addition to artiness, both films had good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa. This film stumbles to an end. I have to admit it was consistent. This movie is bad from start to finish and not worse or better in any part. The actors all did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She demonstrates that she is very talented, very fun and very sexy. But why should she demonstrate it in this turd ball.
