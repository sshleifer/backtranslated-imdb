Sorry, I've already written my opinion on this movie, but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but what's scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. I don't like writing unpleasant reviews or criticizing others' opinions, but I think it's only fair to warn anyone out there who can discuss or not to watch this movie. This is not a good movie. I like movies and I want to see almost everything else, but this movie made it on the incredibly short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave halfway through. If you really are incredibly tempted, see the trailer ... that's the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer. Then there are no surprises, just a shockingly poor dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and would hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop other people wasting hours in their lives on a movie like this !!
