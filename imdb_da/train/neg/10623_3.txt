"Three bold daughters" is a morbidly sweet, brilliant look at divorce, re-marriage and single parents. Of course, social problems and economic difficulties have no place in the picture, perfect life for a single mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise and dates and marries a band leader. Even when "its just a movie" sentence excuses the script from dealing with real problems, daughters suffer from too many incoherent high-note songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturbi plays himself. Isn't it bizarre that any real person wants to star in a movie where their supposed real self gets married? <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this film was released in the 1960s. Only a love of old-style Hollywood romance and comedy could make 'Daughters' a tolerable movie.
