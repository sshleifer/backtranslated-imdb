This movie begins to present some original idea, but became a major frustration later. What is it to have an original start if the rest of the movie did a little to avoid a clich√© photograph? The movie itself is very incredible. I want to know how exactly someone goes into a clinic, gets a nurse outfit, kills a doctor, takes a patient in his bed, puts in his Chevy pickup and leaves? I suppose no one could answer this question so they just jumped to the other scene that stores these little details. The performances are just pretty bad. The villain is just another "annoying crazy antagonist", no depth, completely linear character. After 20 minutes of movie, most scenes are incredible, thought they were put there just for the 90 minute sake, as they were completely unnecessary. A doctor sees a woman clearly under strong medicine, is denied to examine her, is kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet? The closing scene made me break into weaker, only Mickey Mouse could make it more out of reality. I give it 2 out of 10, because the first lets say 10 minutes movie.
