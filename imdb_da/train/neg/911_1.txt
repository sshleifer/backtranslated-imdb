This must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas just as recently as 2006. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many visible sponsored products in one movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why so many famous actors even thought the idea of ​​being visible in a movie like this. If I had respect for some of the well-known actors in this movie before I watch the movie, it's definitely gone now. <br /> <br /> I've heard there will be a follow-up movie to this and I can't understand how it is even possible.
