I feel like I'm the only child in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. He's a great actor at most accounts, but he simply couldn't pull out the southern accent. I think it was regrettable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why American actors were not cast into this movie. Secondly, that performance. It's wonderful when actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard to get a performance strained. Maybe it was Altman, but he is such a great instructor ... I really don't want to bash Branagh for his very hideous accent too much. Everyone deserves to turn up here and there. But it is hard to see anything so annoying that you would rather fall on a chicken leg or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through The Gingerbread Man.
