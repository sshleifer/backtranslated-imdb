I rarely give up on a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when renting it on DVD. Syriana was one I gave up. Halfway through, I hit it in sorry disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie is incoherent, boring, confusing and lacking. The play was dry and without credible depictions. The general plot was good, but developed in such a scary and boring way that it could not understand my attention or interest. The multiple subplots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual linked plot. Too bad such a serious issue and such great actors could create such a flop. I can't imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less a price.
