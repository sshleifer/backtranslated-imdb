Saw this late one night on cable. At that time, I didn't know that the girl billed as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and so naked so often, thank goodness) that I actually sat through this brainwashing drive. I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy - more than the next guy, actually - but it was far beyond the cheesy and more to the bile. The really annoying overactivation of the mad scientist and director, author and special effects is almost complete incompetence degraded by the free nudity that is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before becoming the softened Barbie Doll, she became a porn queen, is really interesting to see - she is deadly beautiful, breaks into uncontrollable giggles at times, looks out of camera and laughs and usually seems to have a really good time, which is more than you can say to the audience. Because although Savannah and her colleagues use quite a bit of this picture naked, it still cannot hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, poorly crafted and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on video or if it comes on cable one night, check it out but don't save your money on a rental.
