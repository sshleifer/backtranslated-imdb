had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise-prisoner finding magic book, err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /> <br /> But there didn't seem to be a story to go with the big idea. rather than chilling / physically scaring, it rested on effects in open fire and OTT body cloud - which didn't scare at all if your over 12. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous where characters are turned off nothing but bodycount. waste of good characters - which was the best thing about this movie. Of course, low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the movie really goes nowhere and I think I will say it needs a Hollywood remake. you only get interested in this version. Absolutely not in the same league as other French films come out in the last few years as crimson rivers, which were at least clear / entertaining, manfique is not ready for the end to be honest. And I bet you can guess the end before you've seen the movie. really really disappointing - impossible to recommend.
