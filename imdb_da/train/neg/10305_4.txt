As an engineer, I have to say that this show started very promising the first season. Most of the applied mathematics was somewhat plausible, and the relationships depicted between Eppe's brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began degrading, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used for crime-solving is now extremely gibberish and very ridiculous to everyone involved in science and technology. The amount of money is still in the process of producing each episode, but ultimately it is broken down into a very unpleasant flavor dish, which is a mix of a C-action thriller and CSI-style cop show. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, just go in the first season and possibly parts of the other. Then I wouldn't waste my time. I even gave the show in the middle of season 3. Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars Let's sum up to 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know his math anymore, I will not disturb my accuracy either.
