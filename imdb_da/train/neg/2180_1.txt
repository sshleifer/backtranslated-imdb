Where do I start, there is so much wrong and terrible about this movie, I'm not sure where to start. Okay, the two stooges who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first they could not create their so-called mind for a name. My guess is that they divide the difference, therefore the main theme is BRAIN, which will not die, but the end screen says the head would not die. No one knows anything about medical profession. After all, doctors take you to "do no harm". Killing a woman for head transplantation will be considered "injury". Plus, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would spell death for Jan in the forehead. Plus who holds a patchwork monster. Which medical school did Bill get out of, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that it tossed hell out of me. Plus, the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated? Everything and a disaster in a movie, it's incredibly stupid and unmatched, except on the MST3K. I give it THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
