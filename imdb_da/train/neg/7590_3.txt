Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name of prima donna, Camilla and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently is enough to remind us of plot similarities from Dumas novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille with Garbo and (I believe) Robert Taylor and last but not least Verdi's opera La Traviata. Beautiful, non-virtuous young ladies, social exhausts for some reason, beloved, split, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... Forgive banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialogue in the opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful extradition of LA in the 30s, an earthquake deus ex machina that comfortably kills the other woman and all the beauty of this mediocre turkey where there is not even any beautiful song?
