I really mean how could Charles Band head of Full Moon put out a total stink ball like DEMONICUS. I think it should never get the green light to begin with. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tyranus others as he is a bad guy. Then the author or director goes his way to a bad ending. It's really a bad end, Demonicus is rising. The last survivor escapes a deadly cave so a picture of Chimera comes to life, cheaply I can add and chase her out. So when she goes home ala FUNHOUSE. A statue that has been destroyed centuries ago is seen for no reason just to fall on top of her. I mean, that makes no sense. What the hell was Charles thinking that allowed this pile of puke to be made, with four different movie companies being so desperate for movies. They could have asked me I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
