Van is a feelgood movie about a guy trying to lure girls into his new van to seduce them. The only thing that this film does not fail to show is precisely the misfortune of the United States in the late 70s. It seems that it was made entirely by amateurs. It's garbage, but I loved it! I have to admit I'm a fan of the 70's trash can! Hope this makes the IMDB bottom 100! <br /> <br /> 2
