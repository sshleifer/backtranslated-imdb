I was so happy to watch this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son also looked forward to it. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This movie ran out of the book more than it is forgiven. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but in this it seemed that he was only fully in the character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was pretty flat. <br /> <br /> I realize this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, mostly. But it seemed to be very B-movie quality, especially the meeting with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was that they released one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the worlds whirlwind tournament, observing people in the gloomiest circumstances that still has the light and love of Christianity. <br /> <br /> I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job of "reforming" Scrooge at the end. It was a refreshing portrayal. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and downcast. And little Tim ... oh not even get me started on bad kids actors ...
