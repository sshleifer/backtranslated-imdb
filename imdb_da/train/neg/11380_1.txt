When I first saw Robotboy, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode, this show tries to teach you to behave yourself, what is good / bad. Episodes were predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-smart boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child and his friends: girl and fat boy. Also this show has no logic. A super modern robot that works on two AA batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots, and it rejects the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn to behave in human society"
