.... this mini doesn't get better with age. I saw this and it is the successor when it was originally sent and so many others were blown away. In early 2002, I borrowed the novels for both WOW and W and R and became even more impressed. I then decided that I had to look both again and invested $ 200 plus on the DVDs. I saw both minis again in painful details and realized that I had done things backwards - I should have bought novels and borrowed the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Don't think it's abysmal miscast? Read the novels and see for yourself. Don't think it's dated? Screen it to someone who is not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast, and see the reaction you get (warning - reactions from such people range from the look of horror to belly). According to the trivia section of this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production quality, music scoring, dialogue - a great story was transformed into a 70's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer / director who was heading over his head. This thing was dated the moment it was completed. These two minis were great as original broadcasts and to those of us who saw them then drag on a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. IMO - this mini hardly lives up to its reputation and serious disappointment.
