I agree with the previous comment, which disappointment. The rent it thinks it would be a good movie since Mira and Olivier where in it. I was surprised at their performance, expected more, as they are good actors. <br /> <br /> Thought it was a slow start but it got worse. I even laughed at some bad stunts !! when should it be a mysterious movie. You can even guess who is the killer in advance !!! <br /> <br /> What really happened? <br /> <br /> Sorry to say but don't even disturb you to waste time and money. <br /> <br /> Drilling !!!
