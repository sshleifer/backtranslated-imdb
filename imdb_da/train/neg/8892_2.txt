Must admit, this version prejudices Shakespeare in advance! No one can trade except the nurse, who was my fav! Juliet had good skills as a teenager, but she can't give emotional depth to her lines, and we can really never connect with her. She's worse at making the scene when she's thinking about drinking the sleeping drink ... God stops throwing! I would have poured it in my mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is quite shocking in this. And don't get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It is still good to see if you are on the hunt to see all of Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of the movie. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and then the current Leo and Clare!
