The film must have been shot in one day, there are scenes where you can see the camera's reflections and its red pointer, even the green light of the landscape that interferes with the actors! The grounds and lines are really awful without even the slightest inspiration (at least as a thriller genre movie). Everything that has to do with Poe in the movie has a low and childish approach. The movie is full of clise and no excitement. If you want to watch a fun b movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for what you want to enjoy (as I did) but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
