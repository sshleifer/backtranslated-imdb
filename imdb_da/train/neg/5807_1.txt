Not even bothering with this movie, it is bad when judged on its own merits, but in comparison with the original from 1972 (which is a classic) it is absolutely horrible. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 movie is poor compared to the book. This is stupid, movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. They are 2 completely different art forms (as if to be pointed out, but apparently do so). If you used this criterion for any movie, then "2001" would be sucked and it would also "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
