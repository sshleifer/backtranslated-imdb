Some very interesting camera work and a story with great potential. But it never comes together as anything more than a student's master's thesis in the film school. <br /> <br /> There are two primary reasons for this. Fist that is not a single sympathetic sign, not even a villain, we might admire for his / her chutzpah. Second, all the play is terrible - even from veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so abundant here, you feel like a picnic - but one of the miserable employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat an underdone hot dog and throw up. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm a little bumpy on a young director who might still go places - as I said, camera work is pretty good. br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - the explanation for this movie suggests that we are going to see a "Modern Western" and the DVD packaging has pictures of the one who suggests it too - but no one actually Associated with the film's do know that this is the kind of movie they have to do. <br /> <br /> That fraud is what hurts; But even without it, the fact that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed to the actors, the story is hopelessly confused, and ultimately it just doesn't care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player about half way through. but the rental shop would not give me my money back. <br /> <br /> Now it really hurts.
