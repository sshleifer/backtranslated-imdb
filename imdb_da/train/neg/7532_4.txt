Something I really love about this woman's short film was the theme's elusiveness - especially in "Living with Happiness." This movie has some great beginnings - unusual location and the potential for a weird film processing, but fails to succeed with clunky exposure dialogue, patchy performances and much television coverage. Once again it is charming TV and very ordinary cinema. The ideas are so whistling that they almost feel clapped like a TV commercial. But the atmosphere is good so we can't complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really love to see that this instructor does a full-length animation and tries to work with a manufacturer who doesn't require so much dull clarity.
