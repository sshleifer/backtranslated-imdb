Rather foolish attempt at a Hitchcock-type mystery-thriller, which undoubtedly exchanges espionage for archeology and based on the Robin Cook short story; Incidentally, I recently acquired another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the accounts, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - an equally imaginative but much more exciting suspend, and unfortunately SPHINX was a false step from which his so far impressive career would not recover. <br /> Despite its size and reasonably decent throw, however, this proved to be a critical and commercial flop - primarily because the story is just not very exciting: in fact, it is rather boring (weak attempts at horror - the archaeological hero has to put up with entombment, rotten largely, and even an attack of flames of bats - regardless). Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady who stumbles upon a lost treasure - it has actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners who have granted much of the country's legacy (under the pretext of culture) too long. Sir John Gielgud turns out to be an antique dealer who is down the road and pays for this "treacherous act" with his life. It is typical that some signs are the opposite of what they claim to be - so apparently allies (like Maurice Ronet) eventually become rogue while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I saw in London in The beginning of 2007 in a West End performance of "Frost / Nixon" which has now become a movie) goes from Down's antagonist to her lover and back again when he decides to hold wealth of Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure.
