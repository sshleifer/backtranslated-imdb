This movie has so little class compared to Strangers on a Train or even Accidental Meeting for that matter, that despite plot similarities I would not feel right in actually comparing this with any of them. The Yancy Butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit I was too embarrassed to author and director to continue to watch. <br /> <br /> I don't enjoy many Lifetime movies, but feel compelled to see one now and then in interest to promote harmony at home. I often moan silently, but this movie made me protest loudly, get up to leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before returning to my normal favorite chair to expose myself to more torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
