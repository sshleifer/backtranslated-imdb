This movie is so bad that I can't even begin to describe it. What in the burning pit is wrong with the authors, the producers and the director? Where on earth did they get funds for this abomination? The reason is ridiculous, the play is at best bad, the story ... What story? The first match in this movie is OK, but then it stays repeating itself until you turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest looser not to quench this silly movie after the first moment. <br /> <br /> *** SPRING ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he's in it ... for 30 seconds . .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest class IMDb has to offer. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: Watch a Uwe Boll movie instead ... twice ... it's more worth your time.
