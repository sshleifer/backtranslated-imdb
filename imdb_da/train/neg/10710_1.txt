Dolph Lundgren stars as a temple coming to New York when a key that unlocks the antichrist is found by an archaeologist, of course, the demon is only a few miles behind Dolph and is not killed as easily as he transfers from body to body. (As fallen without the excitement) Of course, Lundgren is out of his element, and the film is completely unmatched. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movie when on TV. I caught The Minion and the boy I was ever disappointed. This movie is absolutely horrible. With action sequences so poorly staged and poorly edited, you can hardly create coherent meaning in the arena. Worst of all, Lundgrens is extremely convincingly perfect as a hard porter (!) All this got worse that the film is such a rip off the trap (which was good) and the end of days (which was bad but better than this) overall This movie is the worst movie I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. It has literally nothing to recommend it. It's terrible, and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out of 4- (horrible)
