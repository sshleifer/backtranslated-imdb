great mystery, but the film goes down the hill from there. The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter appears from an old girlfriend who asks for help to find her missing daughter. So Ed travels to a municipality of mainly woman. They do not like outsiders. A lot of filler is with Ed shown around town for the girl. It made the movie too long. It finally gets a little better towards the end when we learn about the crazy rituals the woman performs and finally the scary plan present for Edward. All in all, it's not a well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> FINALLY VALUE: I would skip this.
