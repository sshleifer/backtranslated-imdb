"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feel-goody", so-called "heart warming", and out-of-ratings show that ABC has had time to gather. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems these families are experiencing. Because I'm sorry. But would you not think of putting four widescreen plasma TVs, three flat screen desktops, an inground pool that takes up half of a backyard, and creating full of expensive designer clothes is a BIT too big for anyone family? Sure, these families have been through a lot. Sure, they deserve nicer things they previously had. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to fit a whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me about this show is how Ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family or family condition. Telling a wheelchair-bound person that he or she is "so strong" or "very brave" becomes really old after a while. It may sound rude, but believe me; See this show and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this show is overstated. If you want to see it, go ahead. This comment is just a heads-up for what you want to see.
