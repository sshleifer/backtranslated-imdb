I won't say this is a * bad * movie. Unfortunately for me, I get the feeling that the more you know about fences, the worse it simply becomes because of the fact that it becomes completely unrealistic. I have been a fence since I was 14 years old and this film depicts it very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some fitting background), but most other actors - especially the students - just seem to be lost.
