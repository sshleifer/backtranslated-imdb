Not quite away from the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is a troubled mix of sci-fi, horror and suspected comedies. What this corresponds to is a thoughtless and completely incoherent film. There is very little dialogue, mainly because the script, if any, is complete "dam scum". I wouldn't even call it strange, more like just "total nonsense". This movie is sure to disappoint and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the sharp scent will be like the rotten fish ........................ .. ..................................... NOTE
