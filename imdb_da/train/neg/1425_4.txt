I'm not sure what HK movies the other reviewers have seen, but entering the Eagles is nowhere near the top of the pile of HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy that he can play in HK because he couldn't get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks great and is a great fighter (even better with the leg game than his father), but her acting skills are also sub-par. In fact, all the English dialogue (90% of the movie - even more so than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switch to Mandarin sound just to spare me the misery of the poor dial-up hosting and the English redundancy subs. Sure there are some decent fighting (but nothing we haven't seen before) and good filmography, but the osteic visual effects really destroy reality. <br /> <br /> It's worth the price of admission to see Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez go on it. Spectacular and almost worth seeing the rest of the movie for. Finally, you might see some scenes that appear to be "familiar" to you, especially a shooting on an outdoor market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues (think MI: 2). Guess anyone thought that at least a few things in this flick were worth tearing off.
