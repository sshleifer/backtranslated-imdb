Ever since I was eight years old, I've been a big wrestling fan. It didn't matter which federation I was looking at. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, the action is everything I saw it. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. It was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and I just expected another pay per view. But this time. I was mistaken. Instead of the night being one of the best wrestlers to get out of Canada, a true man fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong. Not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened to Owen's death made me very angry. <br /> <br /> Instead of completing the salary per Viewing and doing the right thing as humans, WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money keeping pay per view goes as if Owen's death never happened. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but it was by far the dumbest decision he had ever made. <br /> <br /> And this screaming saying Owen would have wanted the pay pew view to continue. Give me a break. When someone dies on a cushion, its comon looks like stopping it. It's as if a police officer shoots a robber or a robber with a race and then just leaves the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if man's life never did anything. <br /> <br /> But no what happens. Owen will be missed and thank you for the memories of all the times you gave us.
