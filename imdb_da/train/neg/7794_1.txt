This movie is god horrible. Not a quality for this movie. You'd think gore would be good, but it stinks badly. The effects are worse and the action, if you can call it, acts is the worst I have ever seen. This movie was apparently shot on a camcorder and is running on a budget of about $ 500 probably. If you want to see a good zombie movie than see the dead days or the dead day. If you want to see a good cheap shot on video Zombie movies like this, but far better than seeing Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is uatches and meaningless. You have been warned. I have nothing else to say about this silly movie.
