This movie has to be one of the worst I've ever seen making it a DVD !!! The story could have clicked on if the movie had more funds and writers who would have cut the rubbish and sick scenes that I very cautiously parents on .... But the story is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a drive through the film maker, it would have happened from it. It reminded me of many of the fast-paced films that were released in the 1960s, poor script writing and movie recording. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the whole movie were bartenders and beavers. The rest of the film could easily have been made by middle school children. I give this movie a rating of 1 as it is really awful and left the whole family with a feeling of being cheated. My advice- don't see it !!!
