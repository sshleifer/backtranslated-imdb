I read the book and really enjoyed it from start to finish. But when I saw the movie I was very disappointed. First of all, no respect for Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a woman on 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also for the same reason. Will, according to the book, be about 30. I wanted love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's turn to see him, as it was an important part of the story's history. Also Miss Beasley was miscast when the book mentioned that she was a Plus Size lady. I know the movie did not have the budget for "Bridges of Madison County" which I think was released around the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me, this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie. As mentioned, I want Miss Spenser to come out of retirement and write screenshots for her books as they should be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she would consider making the casting as well. The movie let me down!
