It's not often I see a movie that is as horrible as this one. I continued to see every single moment in the hope that this was only meant to be a joke to find that it was supposed to be taken seriously. Well as serious as this genre request. The action was shameful and the situations were terribly confronted and clumsy. If a movie was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we would think that the cinema in the meantime was naive. As it happened, this movie was made in 2000 and I have not yet seen a movie from the quiet era that has as little charm as this one. Absolutely not for the serious movie-goer. <Br /> <br /> [Not worth considering]
