For those who seek succession for the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s, this is not the case. Nor is it a historical drama. Rather, it is a sad little fantasy that has nothing to do with the historic Shaka, but just uses his name to give a particular cache to Sinclair's idiotic story of an African superhero that is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are a few laughing moments, like when Shaka breaks the cross, to which he is chained and kicks a serious slave tribe. You know what Jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a glimpse. True, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can't imagine that twice as much of this shot would have been better. <br /> <br /> What kind of name is Mungo?
