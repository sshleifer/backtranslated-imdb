Who could possibly sympathize with these two unpleasant protagonists? What is supposed to be a light, scary comedy about neighboring children who cannot give up their childhood games by daring, even when they age well into adulthood, comes out more like an exercise of cruelty and dazzling complacency. As children, the couple are unbearably terrible; as adults, they are unacceptably immature. It's a bad combination.
