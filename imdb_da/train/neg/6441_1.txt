As I watched this year's Wrestlemania match card, I was so shuffled and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. It starts ... and it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry with hell because of how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you see Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will go down like a classic and then you expect the same and get the average waste they have every now and then. A moment throughout the show that ruined it for me was when HBK dropped out !!!! The moment HBK loses to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / bags. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't see WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to see it again (fortunately). Again I believe in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I have ever seen), which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. It certainly made up for 'Mania 23' and also gave us many memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you've seen any of Wrestlemanias before this, like those who make you fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), please don't see this and make the same mistake I made and leave WWE behind. And if you see it and are angry, start seeing it again and see Wrestlemania 24, it's totally classic.
