I don't know where to start; The action, the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you might imagine. I can't believe the production staff reached a point where they said, "Our job is finished, time until it's released". I'm just happy that the first two in the series have never done so as far as in the UK. I would actually recommend watching this movie just so you can appreciate how good most movies are. <br /> <br /> I don't know how any of the other IMDb users could find it scary when the "scary" dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around.
