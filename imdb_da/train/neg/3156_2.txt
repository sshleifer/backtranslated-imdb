I just want to make one thing clear - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really lets him down. His plays are still amazing, he is still as charming as ever, and he still looks good. But the movie itself is a nonsense! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say it, comes across a little male ... you're constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend whose own sub-story is a little weird. Me and my family (who sat and watched movies with me) were also cut off by the soundtrack to the movie; at times the music just didn't fit with what was happening in the scenes. But even this was not the worst aspect of what I thought to be a very disappointing movie. I could forgive the stupid lady of the leading lady, I could forgive the freakish characters who were thrown into the mix and I could forgive the bad choice of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was to cut the whole middle part of the movie and jump straight to the end ??? The finish was, of course, planned from the beginning, but how it is left. If you're a Michael Vartan fan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster instead.
