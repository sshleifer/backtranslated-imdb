This movie is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) who tries to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who is chanting an insurance company led by a Kelly Lin. Basically, what the plan police are trying to thief knows them in advance. Covered by beautiful leading actors, beautiful pre-actors, and great camera shots of Hong Kong's scenes, this movie really has no substance at all. It is completely flash and the flash quickly becomes dull. I lost all the interests a third of the way into the movie, and there is no redeeming quality after that, except for cinematography that looks good. Just consider watching this movie if you can do it for free. Also consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes in the movie because it all is the same to the end: BORING. 6.10
