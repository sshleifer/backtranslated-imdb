This true story of Carlson's Raiders is more of an Army training film than anything else. Of course, quickly thrown on a small budget, the only thing it should recommend is an early performance by Robert Mitchum, the only decent actor in the cast, and actual recordings of the wreck at Pearl Harbor that gets your blood boiling as of course it was supposed to do.
