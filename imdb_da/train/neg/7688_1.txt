Horrible movies made on a budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature set used, bad acting and a horrible story of aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood (not enough to disturb) and a sign with an egg yolk that replaces one of the hands. (Yes, you read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> A saving grace was a song performed on "talent show" (how is it for irony?) Of a punk / new waveband that I think was called " I am a Heat Seeking Missile. Apart from that, it's not worth your time, not even at a "bad it's good" level. See if you are into cheesy foreign movies, but everyone else should control. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
