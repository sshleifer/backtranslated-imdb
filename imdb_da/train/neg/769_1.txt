The biggest flaw in this movie is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people would ever be thrown into a professional production by Macbeth. Hearing David Lansbury's soft voice struggling hard with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him the role. I continued to believe that he was not part because he was a miserable actor; not because a larger name was available. So when we see parts of the play in the rehearsal, it is hard to believe that the director does not parody things with a hopelessly mistaken, misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the game through their own scrub interpretations. Sometimes directors are so eager to get their movies done (and authors believe they have the ability to manage their own works) that they settle for less. This seems to be such an example.
