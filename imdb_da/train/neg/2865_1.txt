In general, I do not minus and if this site could I would give this movie -3 out of 10, which means I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Ball alone in the dark was the worst I have seen yet, but at least I gave it 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shoots at nothing made me laugh so I increased the ratings a bit). Hell, if it were in relation to the bloodray, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for the best movie if they competed. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer, which is fine, but they've done better. The start looked OK, but I was, I had to speed up most because death is so boring. I like murder movies, and even though they suck, they could still get some cold deaths. I'm not a fancy movie expert, but believe me he would have shot himself if he saw this. Sorry for rambling, but there is nothing good to say about it, because it seems that someone was taking a video camera and filming this .. this .. disaster. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever took the cake. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I couldn't explain the plot (if there was one), but it was the best I could do. Now, if you don't mind, I'll crawl into a corner and move back and forth and remind me how bad this movie scared me for life .... OK not for life
