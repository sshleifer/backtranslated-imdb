I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it doesn't fail. It feels consistent as it was written and traded by high school kids for any school project, and that is also the level that humor seems to be targeting. There is no subtlety and more judgmental for a mockumentary, it never even feels like a documentary. And even though the lines are not fun at first, an attempt at death squads would have helped - surely something would be better than the sharp assault we are exposed to. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend this to people who like "comedies" in the vein of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who believe that words like "butt" are inherently hysterical fun. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.
