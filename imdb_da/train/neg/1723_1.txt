Man, what a scam it turned out to be! Not because it wasn't any good (as I didn't expect any of it), but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve, which scary the "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names did not appear in the film's opening credits, much less even in the rest of it !! As it turned out, the only movie linking these three actors together is the equally unclear LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) ?? but what one has to do with CRATER LAKE MONSTER is any guess ?? <br /> <br /> Even when I paid $ 1.50 for my rental and I was in a monster movie mood, I still chose to watch the movie regardless, and it was! Aside from the fact that it had a name and an anonymous crew, an unmistakable amateur air was visible from miles away, and the most I could do with it is laugh at JAWS-like performance and intentionally also on the resilient antics of two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owners who often squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking at. The creature itself ?? a plesiosaur, ie. half-dinosaur / half-fish ?? is incompletely realized (of course), but as was the case with THE GIANT CLAW (1957), which I have just seen, it did not seem to bother the filmmakers as they flaunted it as much as possible, especially in the second half of the film!
