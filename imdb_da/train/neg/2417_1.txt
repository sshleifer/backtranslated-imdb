It was undoubtedly the worst thing I've ever spent on money. I feel dirty to admit that I rented this 'movie' and actually paid money to see it. This does not even consider the trash. No no. This is the juice that gathers in the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly wrong neighborhoods after an extraordinary humid summer. To call it the trash can be to break down the waste everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I should register with IMDb and warn my fellow man. This luvahire character claims that this movie is amazing. One must question his understanding of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a very good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director imagined his audience calling and wincing at every sentence published by Ricky or alternatively bursting into uncontrollable laughter at times, as most directors would want a more bleak response from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an excellent job. "I am an aspiring actor myself to take theater at my school and I had to make a game where I had to cry and it is not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give records to actors who have to do one emotional scene and can pull it off. "<br /> <br /> Wow. I must also provide props to actors who can draw emotional scenes. Luvahire, you might want to look into another workgroup there, buddy, if you think these chuckleheads have pulled it off. Still, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just watch the movie. ha. ha. ha. <br /> <br /> "BRING ON THE SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher in school, I would fail you solely based on this comment alone. <br /> <br /> I'm also horrified to continue. Now I'm going to turn the movie bashing to my associate, Mr. Bangla. <br /> <br /> Howdy! If you have read this far, I take it for granted that you have already seen the movie, and you are now looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) Further vitriol rejection of what you agree was a exceptionally bad movie. 2) Further vitriol discussion of what you feel was a good movie effort to defend against such ridiculous shit as myself. Whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition to a reverse party, if I say anything good, it will only disappoint you - let me assure you there is a little chance of such disappointment. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here on IMDb have already mentioned the film's special flaws (eg, the play, the soundtrack, the steering, the dialogue, the editing, etc.), but all these errors can easily be forgiven, in themselves. Few people will rent a movie titled "Hood of the Living Dead" if they demand these items to be first class. The ultimate failure of "Hood", however, is its inability to deliver on its plentiful promise of its name. "Hood of the Living Dead" is almost out of the shelf of the video store with its consequences of corny one-liners and gruesomely creative kills. Here was a chance to mix the zombie movie's cheesy gore with the realism of life in the ghetto, to have gangsta-thug zombies bombed "on the innocent life while rockin 'rags, to get undone pimps drivin' over all-mortal politics in their tricked-out rides The mix of the two genres could have been fun, instead, the movie is more like watching middle-school children presumably deliver the lines to a game they perform, but don't understand, to avoid a betrayal from their video-enhancing audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers resume the movie with the following new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: A homemade horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored "Or maybe they could release it as a documentary." Day Creativity Died: Exploring how a low-budget movie can still be completely devoid of clever or original beliefs despite the lack of ties to a large movie studio. "<br /> <br / > The prospective tenant whose interest has not been rejected must find the following blurb on the back of the video box: "The Quiroz brothers have once again proven to see things that you can easily do yourself are not very interesting. "- Mr. Bangla
