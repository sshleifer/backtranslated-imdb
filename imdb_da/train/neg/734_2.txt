This movie was crap with a capital "C." The opening scene showed promise. But the "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer learned how the plot goes. <br /> <br /> And the wood standard Morty, which was a little scary in the original movie, looks plain lumpy in this. It was of course just a guy in a cheap plastic suit. (And, by the way, who else believes "Morty" is one of the most innocent names on the planet Earth? It's just up there with "Jimmy" or "Peace" when it comes to horror value. Or why not just name the Henry Wood Law freakin'-Kissinger "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" It would be as scary as "Morty.") And then there's a scene where the "hero" hits his father's gravestone with --- "a sledgehammer?" can you guess - "a two-four?" someone risks venturing. No, he strikes violently against his father's tombstone with a twig - a freakin twig. Worse than that when the signs go away, tombstones are actually and inexplicably bleeding. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> There is also an Indian guy living with the protagonist's grandparents, but apparently doing nothing except Morty maintenance. He continues with scary Morty legends, warns those who scoff, and even corrects Morty's arm when damaged under a childish prank. But for all his respect for and tenderness towards Morty Morty give a rat hair behind? No. <br /> <br /> The movie draws on, and eventually more people die in ways similar to their worst fears (sorts). This movie is a real yawner. Don't rent it.
