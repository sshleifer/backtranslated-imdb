The Hazing is a confused mumbo jumbo who wants so hard to be The Evil Dead, as it even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is, it's just not in the same league as the amazing movie. This movie is not as close as original. The plot was previously used by Kevin Tenney in the Night of the Demons, and it was a lot of fun. This flick wastes too much time with a complicated show before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic events. <br /> <br /> As usual, Brad Dourif isn't much to do here, but when he's on screen, he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As far as children's actions are concerned, it is acceptable, but in no way good. The shake-up camera work is more annoying than wise or atmospheric. There are a few good moments when the first guy gets occupied and throws around some deadly one liners as he sends his victims, but it was never scary for a second. The Gore level is mid-to-low, but the director tries to do it by showing the actresses topless a couple of times. All in all, just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste.
