In this brief, a townman and his wife have put their strange life akimbo when the man goes on to wear an old red suit by his mother-in-law. <br /> <br /> I kept an eye on this hope that I could see why it was made or why the other reviewers found it fun. For me, it was a total waste of time. Not everyone's taste is the same, but it was clearly not to remind.
