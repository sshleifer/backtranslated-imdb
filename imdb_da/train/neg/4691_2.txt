A real blowing of the film literally. This British movie is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! A terrorist places bombs on a train. How could the authors and producers of this stink make it such a dull story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, whom the expert called to clear the bomb, gets horrible writing material to work with. Of course, his wife, Anne Vernon, just as he is called to leave him. No wonder we never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a movie, it would be enough to end his career. <br /> <br /> The older man who loved the train and disturbed is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was very insulting to show this man even at the end.
