I feel completely ripped off. Someone needs to refund $ 4.95 I used with Blockbuster to rent this homemade root. This is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and evening. What I don't get is why was it distributed in the first place ??? ... someone must have made some heavy drugs that night the deal was made. I've seen better movies come out of movie schools and I've been to film school so I can say it as a fact. The quality of this work is also just as bad to see ... shot at DV ??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs, but only songs that resemble the same in all sections. Want to see a good musical? THAT DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE.
