I wonder how the actors acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half and half, was she faking or being natural? It didn't make any difference considering that even though she had gone to the ceiling, it wouldn't have changed the movie's pattern. Brian Cox did really well. I almost thought he had always acted this way, difficult, dishonest, in a dirty environment where nobody really was concerned about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she did in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty sick and disgusting. Who would pay to see such a crap?
