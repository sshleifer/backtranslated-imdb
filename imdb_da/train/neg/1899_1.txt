I saw this because I thought there would be many car gates and cool cars to gawk on. Guess I was lied to. This movie is very boring. The movie launches Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), who sits outside a Porsche dealer, to see if they have the right car. When they confirm that it is the right one, Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it by the window and crushes it. He gets Porsche while his friend gets the keys. They start the car and go out into the night. They only supply it to a warehouse to be followed by the police. Then the whole crew dies all the cars and goes their separate ways. Then we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines. He gives a small talk to a bunch of kids on a go-kart track. Then he is confronted with Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in deep * pale *. Memphis is known as one of the most infamous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis leads to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are a few issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 In-movie hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and are planning everything out. The last 12 in-movie hours are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You may see 10 cars out of 50 advertised by the movie. So where are the other 40 cars? Why don't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. Chase: Chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not exciting at all. <br /> <br /> 4. The Dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats burgers and also turns off three keys. It is impossible. The keys were turned open. The keys would have severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach and colon. The boys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him chew it out. This will not work. The dog gets a lot of diarrhea, but no keys. It was stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne put up a toy car in his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. Same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. Cop Under Chase: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to start the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who is not looking at his car. But just as Nicholas Cage starts the engine again, the policeman shifts his head to the right, sees the car and immediately begins to hunt for him. It is stupid. So just when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He only sees the back of it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I've never seen the original, but I'm planning to. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Get it fast and furious instead.
