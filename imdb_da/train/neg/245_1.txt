In addition to a shadow of doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, but retains a love in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and amazingly horrible soundtracks in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest it is All you need to see) combine to create something that is hilarious side splitting. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in 'room' is almost as unimaginable as filmography gets, as dishwashing bottles whiz past your eyes to dampen dialogue. Before you have had time to find out if it's you crazy, the credits roll and the action is fighting for life. <br /> <br /> And apart from the double-headed plasticine giant snails that terrorize our heroes, they also get the extra double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the doubled voices simultaneously. Pure genius. The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've ever seen a copy, so the chances of seeing it yourself are very unlikely. Maybe I own the only copy that exists. <br /> <br />
