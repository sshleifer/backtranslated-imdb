Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, that didn't make the goal. The historic subject of giants is a good, but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a huge cheese wheel. I say, take this wheel and roll it off a rock. I couldn't even see the whole movie. It says a lot because I rarely go away from any movie. I can always give them a chance for last minute redemption. It is impossible to redeem anything so bad. Well, at least the play was good .... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "falls" into this movie is the rating. 1/10 and sink in the negative numbers!
