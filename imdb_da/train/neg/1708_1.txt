OK, I really don't have too much to say about this movie except this: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life and more than 2,300 of them were horror movies. Although I find it hard to decide which is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero's DEATH OF DEATH), I can say at least that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is simply nothing positive I can say about this movie. The action, the dialogue, the director, the makeup, the music ... Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever released. <br /> <br /> Although you're a horror or zombie movie completist, be aware of my warning and don't waste your time on this waste. There is no pleasure in showing off this. You won't even laugh at the complete imperfections on the screen ... Trust me. Please.
