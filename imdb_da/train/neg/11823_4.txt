TOM BROWN'S SHOULDAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> In the late 1800s, the young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) sent to the public school in Rugby, where he experiences the reforms of a radical new principal (Stephen Fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already the subject of many screen adaptations - especially Gordon Parry's superior 1951 version - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets treatment from the early 21st century, kindly by screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV's "Where the Heart Is ") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is pleasant enough and wise, but it is also quite bumpy and boring, only characterized by Fry's sincere performance when the new boss decided to sweep some of the school's most dubious "traditions" and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14-year-old Pettyfer, a talented child with the kind of effortless charm and vibrant looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is typically the UK TV foot, the kind of thing favored by executives who are eager to fill out the forms with the 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unnoticed as this. The British publication 'Radio Times' described it as "daintily odd" and raised a querulous eyebrow over "all that was so funny and brutal and a beautiful, rakish villain who tortured life out of cute young boys". Quite.
