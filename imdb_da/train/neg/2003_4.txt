For all its visual delights, how much better renaissance would have been in live action. The animation is great in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, just like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, the movie world might not have felt so lifeless. There is much to admire here, but in the end I found out that all I could do was admire. I don't have much to enjoy the movie, and it clarifies something that I didn't see before: that the visual elements can be the crucial positive aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters, it can be for nothing. I don't want to go as far as to say that this movie comes to naught, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark Sci-Fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films I thought were wonderful. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain, and Dark City had its thoughtful arch. The Renaissance has shade and light, but a little different. I wish I could have wished this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of it. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic outbreak of color and life. How ironic it is that one of the most gloomy and lifeless movies I've seen this year takes its title from the Renaissance.
