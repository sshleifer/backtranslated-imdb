Jean Rollin artistic rubbish about vampires, aliens and the search for immortality. The women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialogue is inane. It's a ridiculous mess. Good to look at but as a kind of a scary movie or thriller terribly horrible. I'm trying to find out if we're supposed to be scared or not. At the same time, is it put on or not? It's a weird mix of art film and horror that never completely masks, and while it's great to watch it, it never seems to matter, and it's not scary at all, even though the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment. pretentious twaddle. Something to leave in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women.
