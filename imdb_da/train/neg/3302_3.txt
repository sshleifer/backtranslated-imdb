Swedish action films have, over the past few years, evolved into something that mimics American hardening films such as "Heat", but with a low budget. This film follows the same recipe as "Zero Tolerance" and "Bodyguards". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and hard film. The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the play is very poor, especially from the lead role. The film tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military-like robbers who have no remorse and a female investigator who has completely lost it with the problems of the past, but at the same time seems quite rational. It doesn't work that well. <br /> <br /> The bluish-cast photo style no longer resembles it, and it's not even well done in this picture. Only a very few scenes actually look good. Also, the sound is quite strange and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue has been recorded afterwards. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, but not a compelling portrait of a SWAT team leader, has some really fun lines. The music is also quite good.
