I agree with everything Calamine has said! And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine has said is very true, it's time for the girls to move on to better roles. I want to see them succeed as they were a very inspirational couple growing up and I want to see them grow as people, actresses and in their careers as well as their personal lives. So the producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes out of the way, move them to a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many facets. This film, which is commented on, is not so bad, but as I have seen in their film, their movie remains the same with typical plot and style. When in Rome is good for the audience of the younger generation, but the adults who were children when the twins were babies would follow the twins in their successes and therefore I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds, maybe some There is like the sixth sense, the hour, the chocolate, the kind of movie - not to say having just serious movies for them, also humor, but watching them in different roles for what they have played in their recent movies like this and New York Minute. (Note: I'm from Australia so excuse my nice spelling as recognition with s instead of z)
