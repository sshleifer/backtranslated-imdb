Any movie with a title as ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is far different from what one might expect after watching the DVD cover. Bagman is by no means a good movie. It falls into the category of movies that seem to have been (and probably was) filmed on a home video camera. The action is horrible. I haven't heard and seen such wood that works since Troll 2. There are lots of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumped in too fast. The characters are morons and completely forgettable. The end (which I will not spoil) can easily be expected after seeing the very first scene. Because of the cheesy character of the film, nothing but the horrible production values ​​are really scary (terrible attempts at realistic gears, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended only for bad movie aficionados.
