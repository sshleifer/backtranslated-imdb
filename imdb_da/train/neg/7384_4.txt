STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is awarded to France A reconaissance mission along with three new young strike teams recruits to contravene a direct order from above. But the night before they come to strike, they have all been found cruelly slaughtered by a murderer with seemingly inhuman strength. With the French police roaming with their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible himself only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing with a deadly new substance that alters a person's DNA and gives them frightening new strength. <Br /> <br /> Poor coverage. Bad title. Poor after-production manipulation. And bad trailer. Really bad movie. But I have to say, I don't think the Attack Force is right his worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think much of the criticism comes from all the bad news that went before the movie rather than the very quality of it itself. br /> <br /> I have to say that there wasn't anywhere near as much double-edging or ropey editing as I had been led to believe. The double that was (which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) Was pretty terrible and quite frequent but not in use for such a large segment of the movie that I had thought. The plot flowed quite smoothly also in view of all that appalling with the original finished film called Harvester, which continued. Also, as another reviewer noted, the movie has a good Gothic look to it, a new touch to a Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute killing low was the complete and total lack of any thrilling action, with only a few badly-fought combat scenes for something fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, but I'd rather see this again than the Fury of rage, today you die or kill a killer. **
