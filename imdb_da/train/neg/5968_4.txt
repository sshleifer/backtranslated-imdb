If this movie was more about the character of Piper Perabas and less about the bar, it could have been halfway decent. Piper's Violet Stanford and Karen Friendly (Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) both have a virgin kindegarden learning quality for those who are endearing. Here she hopes to find a better movie to be in.
