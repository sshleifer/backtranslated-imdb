I despise horror movies, it's no secret. No plot, bad action and gallon of blood are staples of these bugs in the cinema, and this "movie" is no exception. I can't believe some cable stations actually run this waste. (This particular waste was released directly to video as I remember.) As mentioned, any other movie would be a great insult to the other movie I say this: All the Phantasm movies, all the Jason movies, the Freddy movies, Chucky movies and most Michael Myers movies can be summed up in one word: AWFUL !!! <br /> <br /> Assessment (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
