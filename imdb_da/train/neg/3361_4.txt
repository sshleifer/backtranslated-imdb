This movie was one of the best movies ever made ,,,, it had everything to make a movie great. Incredibly acting, amazing special effects ...... Oh wait, I have to think about a good movie. Well it wasn't one of them, it was just plain sucked. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what kind of bone head would think this movie was a 10. When I cast my voice there was 206 out there, god knows what is going on in their head. Now, as for any other poll, an 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie so good to give it a 10? I know they are the same 206 who thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a fantastic dramatic actor.
