Every year, I see hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur straight-to-DVD abominations that no one in their right mind will ever see. I've seen thousands of movies in my time, many good, many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will always remember as one of the most hopelessly horrible "horror" movies I have ever seen ?? in fact, I still haven't restored the experience of seeing it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it seems like a kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work out of a warehouse? Have the voodoo achievements really recommended that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a "good" movie and I would not recommend it as "so bad, it's good". But if you are entertained by the prospect of seeing probably the most undoubtedly immense movie ever ?? it's for you. Now, when someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen is, I'd say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think it's a bigger crime to make a dull movie than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves the credit for producing a movie that actually supports you with its awkwardness. He is really Ed Wood Jr. in the digital age, and I can't wait to see if he's making another movie as consistently ridiculous as this one.
