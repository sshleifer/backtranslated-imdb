My complaints here concern the film's pacing and the material at hand. While using archive movies and letters, the film gives a new and interesting perspective, because often the material chosen to highlight is simply not very interesting (eg, when Goebbels complains about this or that kind of disease, or tc. German hometown). The film also crawls in covers c. 1920-1939 and then vapors through the war. Overall, the movie is a bit better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensitivity than your average History Channel documentary editor and can artificially arrange the details of Goebbel's life. Still I found it successful.
