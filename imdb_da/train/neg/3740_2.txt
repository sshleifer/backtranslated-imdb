Right now, this movie was ridiculous. Not that it didn't have redeeming aspects ?? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful background landscape. Anyone who does not live on the East Coast should know that South does not have beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah just outside the bats, but Dalton might not suppress his English accent so they had to apologize by saying this was a southern city. To suppress his accent in a southern one was easier. Sure the movie has plot twists, but its fake sense of place was something I couldn't pass by. It's not like Utah doesn't have meth labs ... so why the authors thought it was necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action pictures puzzle me always. Why do they always "hang" the sound effect when the character draws an automatic gun? It seemed that all other sound effects in this movie were a "chuk-chich" which meant that 9mm was loaded and ready for fire. Of course, the weapons had already rounded the chamber so it was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the WAY pyrotechnics were over the top. But hi, this movie was targeted to a particular "market segment" I assume ... It's too bad. Each of the players can act, but this film was paralyzed.
