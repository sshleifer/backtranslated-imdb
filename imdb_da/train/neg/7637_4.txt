This could have been a very good movie if I could see it. Handheld camera was very leaping. From the opening appropriations, I was worried. Several of us saw it feeling very nauseating at the end. But we kept to the end because it was such a charming and interesting film that gives an insight into the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film enhanced its artificial feel. The action seemed very authentic. Some of the dialogues were a little hard to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of the fun. If you get any exercise disease at all, consider thinking about skipping this movie. It's quaint, but not worth the nausea.
