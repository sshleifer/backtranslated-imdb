Sundown - with the weakest, dorkest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unsuitable, pretentious scores ever written - and with the Shane vampire, who are all movements and spoken words, was so ridiculous that I burst and laughed half times and My eyes rolled the rest. <br /> <br /> The vampires do not seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength (sometimes), to turn off a lamp with their mind (once) and .... It really is. Have you ever imagined that Dracula is worried about recruiting from a fight because he ran out of bullets? Neither did I practically any other movie-Dracula would eat this for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main file of the movie is that a human family of four is caught up in a vampire gang battle - Dracula is vs some old geezer s. It could have been some good old B-flick fun, but it Too dramatic music was clearly written by a person who took the film a little too seriously and ends up destroying the remaining part of the movie that is not already destroyed by clay flags, mediocre plays and the ridiculous manuscript. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's just too stupid to be fun. Sure, it has some entertaining moments, but they are few and far apart.
