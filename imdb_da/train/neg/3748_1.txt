... but it just doesn't work and I'm surprised to see how many people consider it good. For what reasons? There are some loose hints here and there, but the whole material is self-reliant and convincing. Lynch's films are generally exciting because they create a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when they do. There is some visual sense, there are some subplots, signs, ideas, etc. But this is boring and yes, meaningless. Because what is to explore is either "small", either long-term or simply told before in a superior way. It's just Lynch who explores DV, nothing more so it has to be treated like this. 1.10
