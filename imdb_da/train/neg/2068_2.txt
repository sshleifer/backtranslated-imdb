Louise's gospel was a great disappointment to me. I had received an email from the theater showing that it was a great and inspiring movie. It was neither big nor inspiring. The cinematography was pretty nice with the whole movie. Much of the scenes were flashbacks that were done in a way that could not sometimes say what they were about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also, many of the people in the film were far fetched. The relationship he has with his ex-son is never clear. Also the whole movie has most of him one way, and then suddenly BAM, he is healed and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that are bad in his life, so he lives his life as he lives it, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to box . Thumbs Down.
