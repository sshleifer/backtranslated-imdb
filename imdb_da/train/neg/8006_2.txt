What this movie does is to combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotions out of the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, with unobtrusive storytelling, frustrating plot holes and conflicting scenes, this movie caused me mostly frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster movie ever." <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the start, this film goes fast and naughty. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is campy and fast, and welcomes the classic "environmental disasters" that have born so many other monsters. The pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often meaningless dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allowing the movie to jump right into the action. With 10 minutes you get 'why', 'where' and 'how' of the animal and are ready for action. In this, the film delivers. After another short and well-run order, the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precious little girl, friendly grandfather and talented sister (aunt) and of course the monster. The characters are introduced in conjunction with each other, and their conflicts are instantly apparent and allow the audience to feel for them when the monster suddenly discovers disturbance in the river basin where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster it is itself looks good: Alien yet familiar - like a dog and a fish pushed out of an octopus. The effects of creation are unsurpassed, and although it looks strange, it is trustworthy and in no way in the movie can you see it being strict. Even the movement of the monster was terribly familiar as a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum, the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating them in that path. When the monster's path crosses with the family and the tragedy follows, it's really a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge, but from there, the film's appeal begins to sound. <br /> <br /> After the dynamite start, the film quickly loses focus and continuity. Plot lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position without apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced to dramatic scenes confusingly intent while obstructions appear and disappear seemingly random. <br /> <br /> As for the comedy, let me say this: I am willing to accept that much of humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so maybe things were lost in translation. But as an Asian high school student and as a person who has lived in Japan for the last 5 years (still here), I would like to believe I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the average white guy. That said, there were many parts of the movie that I understood to be fun, but for me it was not. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: After the first attack where the young daughter is lost, the family is at the funeral; everyone is grieving. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension is raised even higher, as it becomes clear that the two brothers are in opposition to each other. Both begin to make their losses and win up to compete with each other over who cares harder. This competition is the core fun: two brothers who do not like each other so much that they themselves compete for a funeral - it shows the stinging character of family life common to Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun on family and ritualized grief is supposed to be fun, but really seemed out of place with a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then came the plot holes. There are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse, explained and fretted over only to be proven impotent and meaningless in the end. Finding an obstacle is not a hindrance can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect some commentary on that. Instead, the audience is bursting with moments of anti-climax when problems just "are not there" anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you: Why bring it up in the first place? <br /> <br /> This was predominant through the movie, as problems brought new problems, and suddenly the film world is filled with conflicting forces that never resolved each other. Of course, the introduction of new and bigger problems is a time-tested history story, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to the forced shortening of another, you at least expect the new bow to be fully explained. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you were getting more stories, only explaining 20% ​​of the way, and ultimately never converging parts to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept that much of this can be 'cultural'. Perhaps it is in Korean history history to put comedy into a tragedy. Perhaps it is normal for stories to go over like a child who colors outside the lines on each side, but never finishes one. Perhaps it is OK to present a problem to develop the plot, but then remove the problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all the hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
