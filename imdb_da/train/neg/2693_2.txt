<br /> <br /> Although the leading actress is STRONGLY beautiful, the plot is not too acceptable because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of history. You might think that middle-class teenage school girls in the 1950s easily gave their virginity without thinking of marriage to 30-year-olds, they hardly know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> One must believe the young high school teenagers are very confident and confident as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world. <br /> <br /> One can believe that an experienced physician would not know the blunt orphan of Stroptomycin - the smelly fermenting by-product of busy soil microbes - and not discover that any lifeless soft powder is false, but I don't believe . <br /> <br /> One can think that 30-year-old troublemakers can go in and hang out inside a public school during a social school and make problems, but I think school social workers are traditionally a protected environment, and parents, chaparons and school staff would be around to prevent this. <br /> <br /> One last nit, through Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends referred to themselves as foursome. There is probably an explanation why the five were the four, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't really ring for me.
