I don't even want to call this thing a movie - it's a movie that shouldn't have won any awards. The act was horrible as the stupid scenarios. It is just the kind of movie that many people think is addressed to an NRI audience, but is actually left overseas for its awkward and overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors who know the English language have so much time to do so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all these token English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian films where English seems quite real - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Though it was not a good movie, it was a good movie, and the language didn't seem to "put on". <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of the fact that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only half-fun parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, not even wasting your time with this movie.
