This is just awful, really terrible trash can. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But while this can work in the mechanism of a porn movie ?? can even have been a hit as a porn movie ?? This tries to mask itself as a "movie" with real things to say with true emotion and struggle. It is not. It's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time. I'm sure all these women (and men) in this particular movie could have faired decent in the porn movie business in the 1970s. . . but not in the actual film business. <br /> <br /> The action was hackneyed, so bad, I mean really terrible. The writing was even worse. I can not blame all these actors ?? they had nothing to do with. The very broad structure or plot of the film could possibly be done and done well with good authors and competent actors. The very broad structure or plot is a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar as a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their women enough. If there was more to write - better to write, much better to write - and less free sex pictures we could have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been shot, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all the time; It would have made more money. It's almost a hardcore porn movie already, and it's still the only non-porn movie I've seen showing a male erect penis.
