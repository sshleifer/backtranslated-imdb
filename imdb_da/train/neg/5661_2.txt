The principle, though not completely ridiculous, was absolutely ridiculous. What had to happen at the second meeting with Tritter was that Tritter was just wasted. House hires some guy and de-physicizes Tritter. In fact, Tritter would have been brought up for harassment, the rectal thermometer episode would have been the subject of justice, motive and opportunity, and the hospitals lawyers would have made mincemeat out of Tritter and the particular department he was working for. He would be in prison as someone would be involved in the harassment of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The trial would have won House a tasty settlement, enough to keep him bearing Vicadin well into his old age. While Tritter would close somewhere driving a cab, trying to rehabilitate by doing good for people for two years before people tumbled over to have seen it all before.
