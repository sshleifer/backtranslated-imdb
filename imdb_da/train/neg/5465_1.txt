This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's as fun as making hard manual labor with abdominal cramps. The movie starts out badly (I will judge the first few minutes of the movie a 1/10) and then it gradually gets worse, minute by minute. The only way to judge it at all would be a kind of abysmal spiral negative number that grows in ninety long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but it best describes humor in this video. Somehow, the video even manages to make cute, lightly dressed females and sex looks grotesque and uncomfortable. This movie is incredibly bad. I would say it would be better to be unlocked with the titanic theme being played over and over, and with Buscemis characters from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in the ear than watching this movie. The followers are almost not so bad. If you are going to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather see 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again. Don't make me wrong, it took a kind of criminal genius to make a movie so awful, and if ever a movie deserved a price to be horrible then it is.
