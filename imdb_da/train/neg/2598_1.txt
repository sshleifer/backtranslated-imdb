Even in a bad movie there is usually some redeeming feature, something you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that show, or the part of the script or the special effect, it was just simply awful everywhere. The actress was ridiculous, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable breakfasts on Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were at best shabby. This was a very bad movie and one that even Drew Barrymore wants was expelled from history. See it if you want: a) Suffering self-inflicted pain. b) See just how bad a movie can be. This is a movie where I can use the clich√© "which is ninety minutes of my life, I will never come back" for any reason!
