I'm glad I watched this movie after Mr.Sandler became known. <br /> <br /> It's bad .... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painfully boring home video. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy his other movies ...... but if you are a fan like me .... stay away from this one. It can change your thoughts about Adam. Never get out of the horror that is this movie .... I've had a better time watching old people play scrabble in a home .......
