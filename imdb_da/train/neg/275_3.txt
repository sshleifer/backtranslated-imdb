It is amazing to me that everyone could comment that this film is not sermon. It is not only oppressive preaching, but absurd, phased, dramatically straightened and painfully flooded. When you see it, you feel that an 8 year old child is punished by having to write "I'm not a fascist" on the board 100 times. Now I understand that it was made during the height of WW2, and was meant to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he created (as someone would wholeheartedly applaud) and I am sure that it exactly captured today's mood . But it is presented in such an immature, obscure, sledgehammer way that it fails abysmally as a work of art. The only good ideas here are from Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quiet heroic anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as the entertaining abused rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless upbringing has exposed them to all kinds of adversity, the children are ridiculously depicted as robotic, well-behaved little snips. They don't even look remotely real. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is such a dimensional noble, I cringed every time she was on the screen. Her every word is her every gesture to persuade how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING she is of the SACREDIFIES that her husband must do, and the great reason he struggles for she must have been led to get a painful electric shock if she dares allow any kind of doubt or shadow to the surface in her depiction. <br /> <br /> So yes, it's a very important movie, just not a very good one.
