Redundant, but again the case. If you enjoy the former SNL comedian and his antics (in this case Schneider), then you should go. Basic comedy. Man's life is rescued by having different animal organs transplanted in him. Unfortunately, he takes on the characteristics of each animal. Former Survivor Colleen looks great here now that she has no open wounds on her legs and a little makeup on her face! D
