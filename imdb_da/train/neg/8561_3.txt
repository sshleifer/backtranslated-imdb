The cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of John's best movies. Don't make me wrong, with any John Wayne movement there are always some good spots. And this one has the fair share. But all over the picture moves slowly and just doesn't live up to the hope it could have been. Bruce Dern is again doing an excellent job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The kids in the movie were average but could have been thrown better. This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie guests. <br /> <br /> This would be a great family move to see with your kids. Just be aware that there are a few scenes that you might want to look at before letting the young ones see it. But most children I know have seen the movie as it. Maybe it's because they see children, their age does all the adult work.
