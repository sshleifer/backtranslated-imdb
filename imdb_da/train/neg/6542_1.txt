The person who wrote the glowing review of this wrong project must be related to the author / director / star - or is actually the same person as it speaks for rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone who didn't have a connection to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a movie - tell a story; entertain; draw me in with living signs. Sure you can do it artificially without bowing to the commercial items designed for mass apples. However, you must not address items of artistic expression in a vacuum, where the audience is in a constant struggle to understand on skimpy stories. If I need to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread, then it makes the concrete dust easier to buy.
