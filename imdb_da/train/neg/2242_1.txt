I caught this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I hadn't heard much about it; only that it was a tight pace, shot digitally on a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big Brit girl. But I have to say I was seriously disappointed. "This is not a love song" follows two criminals who accidentally shoot and kill a farmer's young daughter, get involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take the matter into their own hands and hunt them. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that this is another example of style over substance in a British movie. The camera's angles and editing are completely inconsistent with the story, as are the top performances and the frightening use of slow motion, which only serves to make everything look like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the movie look edgy and gritty, which instead comes across as hilarious and over the top (Cue a pathetic, mandatory drug scene and countless, pointless camera zoom). We haven't seen so many things before, and made a hundred times better, especially in John Boorman's masterful "release". But in the last film we were actually worried about the characters. In this movie I found myself just wanting to be chased and killed as soon as possible. Even this would not have been so bad if their opponents were scary or worthy, but instead are just a collection of stereotyped, inbred landlords. Again, another offensive, overused cliche appears in the foreground. Surely there are some good people in the country, filmmakers? In his defense, "This is not a love song" contained a few good exciting moments, but it is difficult to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or by pushing, getting a very limited cinematic release. It's not a patch on last year's low budget chased in the hills movie "Dog Soldiers". Perhaps British Cinema could actually be restarted if the real money stopped going to the wrong people.
