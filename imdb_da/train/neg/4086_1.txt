I came upon this movie with high expectations. I was aware of Greenley's work and 'The Tempest' and was interested in an adaptation. I first wanted to turn off after ten minutes, but felt that it would be unfair. There was a rendition of a storm, but where in your mind do you realize a little boy looking over a toy boat? It's symbolic of what? I continued another ten minutes, my finger pulling over the 'off' button, somewhere something would catch my interest. This is not Shakespeare, it's not a cinema. There is time and place for it, but I will not waste my time and there is no room for it in my studies of Shakespeare. After 25 minutes I gave up and that was the end. I then read all the comments on this website, and the film's pretentiousness is only matched by its accused. 'It's a painting ..... so put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet ..... keep it on stage so'. Shakespeare can be made intelligent, and the games were made for mass meters that they were available, and this version helps put a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population as a whole - and I don't think Bard would be happy with it.
