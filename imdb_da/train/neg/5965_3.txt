In 1454, in France, wizard Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded, and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampyrism and lycantropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their fines. In the current days (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session where they evoke Alaric de Marnac's spirit. They decide to travel to Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the country, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the enemy holds them, bring Mabille back to life and perform the locals in gore sacrifices. After his father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that he has Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; Together with Maurice they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I bought a box of horror genres with five DVDs by Paul Naschy pr. US $ 9.98; Despite having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the unknown and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a trash B (or C) movie that immediately made me remember Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is described through horrible manuscript, direction, performances, filmography, decoration, special effects and edition and with many naked women. The result is simply fun and I can guarantee that Ed Woods style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
