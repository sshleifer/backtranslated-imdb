Someone called Howard Koch a schlockmeister, but he wrote the manuscript of "Casablanca", right? Or he didn't. Perhaps there is more than one Koch slimming around in Hollywood, and yet I'm not so fond of "Casablanca". Wait a moment - yes, there is another Howard Koch slipping around Hollwyood. It's the one who wrote "Casablanca." Does not matter. I will take so much care in this comment as "Howard W. Koch" put into this production, that is, just a little bit. <br /> <br /> You know how it sounds? Someone read Cliff's Notes on Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided, as there were no original ideas on board Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollywoodize it with a good ending. There are differences. Lear decides to divide his big property between three sisters and before they do, they ask how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw at his feet and brown nose to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to go to opera at Lear. But in the play, Lear stays alive to regret his decision to give the two criminals his stash and deprive the honest girl. He was caught wild and naked during a storm on the ants, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Children can do it for you. (Take my child, for example, after all the effort I wasted on raising him, he shows no interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) Finally, everyone in the drama dies. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the good sister is morose and suicidal in the film, but when she tries to self, someone jumps in and saves her, so the ending is more or less happy. It is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy unless you define Hollywood as a tragedy sufficient for itself.
