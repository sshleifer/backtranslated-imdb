For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was horrible. Quickly forwarded it and never got any better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so large, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought it was fun for a chick flick. What's up with that. Movies were very slow and boring. I would not recommend it to anyone at this time. I want my money back to this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid thing to make people think you're pregnant. I thought it would be so much fun I had my own children and I helped others with children. It could have been more in line with reality.
