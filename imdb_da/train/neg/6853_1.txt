Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the productive Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood-like outer-space politician is chasing an ugly flying head (!) To Earth and getting involved in a South Bronx band war! Mercifully short but deadly boring, with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should also have fired the continuity guy: Note how Thomerson sunglasses disappear and reappear in every second shot. Although bad, but that's why we look at these movies, isn't it? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys is said to be even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****) <br /> <br />
