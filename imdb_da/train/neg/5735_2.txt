First of all, this is a low budget film, so my expectations were incredibly low in it. I assume that most people look at info for this movie, just wanted a blood party, and that's all it is. <br /> <br /> Plot? There is really no one. It is pretty much so but in China and a hell much worse. Cast? There is no period. Special effects? Absolutely awful in my opinion ... There were cutaways and the blood was often quite incredible due to quantities, splatter, color, texture, etc. I think the purpose of this movie would be a brutal, shocking movie. Now it had a great potential on a larger budget, but poor scripting, poor dialogue, horrible acting, what seemed to be video recordings, and simply incredibly "gore" made this movie really awful. <br /> <br /> Movies are worth taking a chance against some reviews, even "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (for example, blood track was the latest I saw against reviews that were worth it), but It was simply terrible. I hope people who are considering this movie read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I'm all for brutality and shock, but overall unrealism and really horrible acting make a horrible experience. Save your time / money and chance for something else, you won't be disappointed.
