It really impressed me that it was done. The director / author / actor must be truly charismatic in reality. I can't think of any other way it goes over the script scene. What I want you to consider is this ... while I watched the movies, I was upset by the actors. It felt like being in a stand-up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and you are sitting there and not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him, he's happy to try. I really like knowing what the budget is, guessing it should have been low as the film quality is really bad. I will write 'the jokes did not appeal to me'. But the reality is for them to appeal to you, you have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. So imagine it in script form ... and this guy got the green light up. Isn't that impressive?
