The principle is ridiculous, the characters are incredible, the dialogue trite and the end absurd. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but seeing him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed Frenchman is not as entertaining as it sounds. <br /> <For its part, Meg Ryan is once again as flashy and adorable as one (choose): Kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the sweetest creature on earth. She also does not have the slightest resemblance to a real man. <br /> <br /> This movie hits me as an opportunity obsessed with friends Lawrence Kasdan and Kline for holidays in Paris and the South of France while being well paid for it. So I can't really blame them.
