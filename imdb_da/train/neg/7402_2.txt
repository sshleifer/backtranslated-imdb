This is a typical example of highly qualified video / advertising instructors trying to make their first full feature movie. On the one hand, the picture camera, camera, lighting, CGI and even sound are very polished and have a really "expensive" look. Even the actors show some potential - to the point where even the best actor could not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, it's not a bad plot, but hardly a plot at all. <br /> <br /> So 50% of the dialogue consists of "What the hell was that?" "What was it?" and "what the hell was that?" In neither case is any of the characters or audiences provided at least a hint of an answer. In most other dialogues one gets the feeling that there was never any kind of dialogue book, and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that was never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance could be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not allow her these tragically horrible dialogue lines that other actors had to deal with. That way, she could just show her acting talent that the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to. I think there is no actor in the world who can make up for a dialogue like this: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is this really, huh? Emily: Stop it. Ben: A lot of psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone should take control of this situation. Legs: This situation cannot be controlled. Not by you, not by anyone. Emily: Not of you either. Legs: No <br /> <br /> Got me goose bumps. But not for horror, more for the terrible attempt. For a moment I am ashamed of the actors for adding this to their whites. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for the outstanding technical work.
