This movie was horrible. OK, my favorite movie is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I was always bound to be a little biased. <br /> <br /> The reason merges and throws enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' very dubious. (He is not a virgin, but is allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things do not make sense and are inexplicable as I fear LaBute does not make a horror movie. (How are two people we clearly saw in a car at first living well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks scary and confused, and his character tends to call "Rowan!?" by the slightest noise. They "nod" to the original being annoying as they come out as sticky rather than as intelligent tribute. For example, some events reflect the original (The girl falls out of a closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage searches the island), and several lines of dialogue are picked right from Anthony Schaffer's original manuscript and shovel. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will give a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can't be bothered to write more about this movie. It lacks any substance. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the movies they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely).
