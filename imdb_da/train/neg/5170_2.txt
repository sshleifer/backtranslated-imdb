Wow, could have been such a good movie, Beginning with Brittany Daniels bound, I'm thinking cool, we're going to get a flash back, but nothing begins the movie again with the baby filming. This movie would probably have been better if it wasn't for the actor. I think the play was mostly terrible. Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with, they had the best they could. Put it really spoil the movie for me. The twins were the only ones who seem to have some acting skills. The film pulls too long after the supposed shocking conclusion. All in all, I've seen worse low budget movies, but considering this was the hype with the 8 movies to die for I was very disappointed. By the way, some reviewers said that there were gore and things. So I saw the same movie .. Now it's 4 out of the eight, and so far only one has been good ..
