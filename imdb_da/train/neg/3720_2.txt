Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? It's certainly not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intentional humor, but on a few occasions the poor actors, bad instructors and scary writings had the audience laughing loudly at the cinema. The reason is acceptable - a promising young artist who just reaches his top shot of an assassin he accidentally enters. The murderer sees the young artist's work portfolio that he carries and decides to participate in an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition, the murderer meets the dead artists' sister and they fall in love. These are all very predictable things, and the end will not have any guess as it is so poorly written. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city is. Don't waste your time on this movie unless you study how NOT to act, direct or script a movie!
