What a waste! This film could really have been somewhat decent, but it is especially a writer, and the protagonists are rather superficial and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recreation of the late 70s decadence was well designed, but overall this movie was a great waste of time. Instead, the movie to be seen dealing with similar themes and the same basic timeframe is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
