This movie is actually worse than most movies I have ever suffered, and I have a lot to do. Absolute nonsense. It has a terrible, forced dialogue; meaningless plot developments; really pulled out "spooky pictures" scenes that look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 in Best Attractive Women; long boring scenes involving the women mentioned (forget what you know about virgins, especially those with lopsided false breasts); murmured, difficult to understand speech from some of the characters; and they actually used the Killer Klowns masks from outer space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny, but it's not. The wood Fell is the worst guy in the film's history. <br /> <br /> Definitely give this a miss.
