Films like these are for the originals what Album Oriented Rock stations are for, what music used to be - repetitive, boring and drained of all the original energy of a selection of corporate drones. I'm glad Aragorn wasn't typecast as an expected psycho of this P.O.S. Go back and see the 1971 version, count the things that would never be included in a modern version, and thank you for whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that was not based on other people's ideas and was not passed through a board before it became clear.
