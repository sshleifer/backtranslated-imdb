I have to say I was very curious to watch this movie and it was considered a notorious disaster when it was released by the 1900s Fox in 1970. It was only a deeper interest that I had to see what made this movie so bad. When I saw it, I think I have my answers. Although I would say that makes it curious, the play, the direction and the script are so scary that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to carry the film, but after the opening of the sex exchange operation, the film goes so far down the hill that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help as he looks and reads on the screen, he sometimes looks as if he is wondering what he is doing there. Rex Reed runs around like Myron, Mira's alter ego, and even has his own famous masturbation scene. Bravo to debut shows! Farrah Fawcett plays a stupid blonde; she seemed to be convincing in this role. Of course, of course, the most infamous role went to Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face who did sexual innuendo seemed more suited to a horror movie. I don't mean to put this roll down personally; But in this movie no one seems to look good. The direction seems so uncertain and non-existent that the film is not only bad, but also dull. Throw some old movie recordings of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To each their own for everyone who enjoyed it, and I was glad I at least saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that was always known to be from the beginning.
