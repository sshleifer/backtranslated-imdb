The first one was the best. The other sucked because the dialogue was horrible. Although the story was not so bad (in fact, all history lines are good and bad). Throughout the film I derived a couple of times. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts skill but not a good actress in Rush Hour 2. Also Chris Tucker was not good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, horrible acting (but it's based on her script). All the signs were not so good. But some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 are always action and less sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan doesn't do the things that are good for him.
