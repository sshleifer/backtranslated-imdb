I'm a big horror / splatter fan, I even enjoy horror movies some people consider to be stupid. I also like gore. The more the more as long as it has a point. Having read the other people's reviews on the site, I was sure that this movie would be a little gem. But much to my disappointment, it turned out to be one of the most meaningless movies I've ever seen. The action was horrible, the dialogues were stupid, the plot was meaningless, the special effects were useless and editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the last 2 years. Normally, I find that all these features make a great b horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I was talking 11 EUR to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you actually enjoy a meaningless gore (for example, the "violent sh * t" movies), avoid at all costs!
