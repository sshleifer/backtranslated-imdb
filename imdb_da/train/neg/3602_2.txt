I am an avid B-Rate horror movie buff and have seen my fair share of slasher pictures so I have a significant gauge to judge this movie by. It is easily located in the top echelon of the worst horror movies that the 1980s have to offer. It's not as scary as the demon's night, it's not as horrid as Re-Animator and lacks the camp value of There is nothing out there. That said, this movie has no value. Remember, the movie is for a completely different movie. The still images on the back of the DVD box have not been taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> VALUE: $$$ (There is a lot of violence but we've seen it all before. A killer kills nubile students and occasional member of the plant by pushing the neck and all the other tired methods of murder, as horror film exploits). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: None <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who sensibly changed his name to Forbes Riley after this movie was made - who accepts a job lesson in one university, people are starting to die, and Forbes thinks the killer is targeting her, is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student? To be honest, it is impossible to take care of because the script does not disclose character outside Forbes). ACTING: $ (Terrible at all levels. This slasher has the sense of a school production - college because college students can get a better flip than this. Forbes shows a modicum of talent like Seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is of "extras" caliber of shopping).
