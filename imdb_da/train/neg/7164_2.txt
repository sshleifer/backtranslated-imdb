This movie is more deceiving than ever by using an exciting-looking actor who Walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this! And the fact that the movie should be about some witch and you really don't see it before almost the end of the movie, but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this dreary movie while it is going or trying to get to the point of that point, and you have to go through this whole trace of boring actors and actresses who are constantly thinking about passing a different movie and deciding on this and how you just washed your money, do it constantly useless there. I'd rather see cartoons for good stuff. Let this one be alone, thank you!
