Yes, this movie makes me feel real horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than 1 hour in my life and tried to see it. The bald guy just gives me the impression of being psychic - Junkie actress and girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me, if you appreciate your time, avoid this movie, I understand that a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have the money, but it is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I always support independent movies when it deserves the support, but movies like this make a bad name for this kind of movie. I'm still traumatized. I don't want to rely on any good coverage anymore.
