This movie was two and a quarter spooky hours. Someone tell me what the meaning was? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical attitude. It was about a ragtag group of Confederate bushwhackers (terrorists?) On the Missouri-Kansas border claiming all Nordic sympathizers and abolition in the US civil war. But apart from gratuitous violence, there was not much of a point on this movie. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is really nothing more than free violence? If it was meant, it was done pretty well, but I don't think so. I think the producers really thought they were making a valuable movie here, but as far as I was concerned, there was a complete lack of any plot. It looked as if I was looking at a paperback novel come alive, with the characters resembling what you would look at the covers of such novels. <br /> <br /> This movie will be burned with some of the cities this gang burned!
