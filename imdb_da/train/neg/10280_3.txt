Does HeidiJean really watch this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Boring, bland and lacking in imagination and heart. I continued to watch this movie wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie! The woman has no demonstrable personality and gives a completely weak performance. Baransky was great as usual and gave the only modicum interesting everything. Probably her involvement was the only reason why the project was greenish at first. Perhaps I expect too much for a lifetime pioneer who is playing 15 days from Christmas, but I went through this thing and thought about it with another director and a recast of JJ with an actress who could at least induce sympathy it might have a nice little movie.
