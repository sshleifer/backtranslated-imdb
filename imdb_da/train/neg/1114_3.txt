In this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this was an evil disappointment. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, like the dialogue. The West is not common fare for Hollywood so much these days, but movies like "Silverado" show that someone out there still knows how to make a good one. Considering it, it's hard to imagine that anyone would ever cost any kind of release much less to create such a faint movie like this. If you love and are looking for a good Western, look!
