Well, I couldn't get into the plot, but it's just me. Spotless camera movements at times, yet this movie has got a charming vintage quality. The action is real at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence, which involves brightly dressed ladies, which was great. The climax is confused and uneven, but still ... is riveting, even to Stella Stevens. Stunts are interesting, especially because of the 70's las vegas background. There are a few jerked handheld camera moves at the end, which keeps me guessing for a while. But I don't think I'll be chasing the DVD right now.
