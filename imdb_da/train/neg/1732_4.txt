Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so I'm happy to see some of their movies. Basically, a man in a horn factory is the fourth to break, and soon enough, Ollie breaks with all the horn sounds. He rests with Stan at his side, needs quiet, and Doctor (James Finlayson) phones say he's coming over to check out Ollie. Having understood the plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross-eyed repairman, the doctor comes in for a check-up, and after some tests, he recommends drinking goat milk and getting some sea air on the sea. After Stan practices some trumpet games, hangs out the window via the telephone cord and a car crash, he and Ollie to a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the quay trying to paint a goat, and Stan has brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the paper's front page reads that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has fled, and he sneaks on the boy's boat while they sleep, and the goat chews through the boat rope and jumps out to sea. In the morning, their location looks and Killer comes out and demands something to eat, and he tracks Stan and Ollie making fake food, for example. string for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, mushroom for meatballs, and he forces them to eat it. When Ollie starts choking on something, Stan beats his trumpet to help, and Ollie's rage makes him beat the murder, and it continues until the police arrive, only to get Ollie's rage get them in jail too. There were the smallest moments of comedy, but it's not a big black and white movie. "Well, here's another nice mess you've got me!" was number 60 in 100 years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on the Comedian comedian. Okay!
