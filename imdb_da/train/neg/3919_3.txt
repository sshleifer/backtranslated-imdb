This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic. I respect imagination, but the Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan .. is fantasy ... THIS IS JUST NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why did they include this Splatter tongue, it makes everything worse. The only good thing is cinematography and the cutter's job.
