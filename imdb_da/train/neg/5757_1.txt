The film was visible while Nicolson was on the screen. But I had to fight to get out of boredom when the movie was dependent on Meryl Streep to wear scenes without Jack; she was as bland as could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; These characters have been portrayed before - and much better. It felt like a real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring and not worth writing or looking at. Why Ephron felt his life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about escaping me. Perhaps she wrote it as therapy - for many authors, putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic. Fine: But why why anyone in Hollywood felt that this story was worth filming is a mystery to me.
