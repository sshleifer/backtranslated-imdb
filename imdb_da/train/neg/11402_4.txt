Exactly what you would expect from a B movie. Derivative, free nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better acted (defintly) better written, instructed, etc. But then I think it would not have been a B movie. The actors suck a lot, in fact, it seemed pretty much like an episode of buffy vampire plays or anything except much blood, beauty and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be appointed. She is absolutely the scream queen in the new millennium. Not that acting really matters in these movies, but she was better than any of the other actors. She is also smokin hot, in the plastic jump suit thing she had for the whole movie - wow! Her back is great in the outfit, I mean it every time she turns around, you can help but check her out. And near the end of the movie, the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely denied. <br /> <br /> So if you're a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself) check this out. If not, you should probably avoid at all costs.
