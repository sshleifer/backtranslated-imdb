Although the plot was very detailed and the story line was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagal's voice was called by someone else's most of the movie was disturbing as you were unsure of who spoke. There were many parts where he would begin to speak in his deeply grated voice and then the next one's voice spoke to him. I do not know the reason, but if he had difficulty in voice during the production of the film, I think they could have shot the events that did not include his own voice when he had recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the movie's quality. When paying for a movie, whether at the theater or on DVD, this film was not the host of the admission fee charged. I have long been a supporter of Steven Seagal and all of his films he has made in recent years. To date, I think it's one of the worst we've seen yet
