There are laughs in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be fun (before deciding that he was a serious actor). But what worries me a lot about this movie is how unlikely almost all the characters are. Apart from the two main lines, everyone is a jerk. I mean, these little town losers are about as scary as you can get. You just have to look and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. Moreover, the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this movie was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh, in the end they all come together as one, but I just don't enjoy the trip to get there.
