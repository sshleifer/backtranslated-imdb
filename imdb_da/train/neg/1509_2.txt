I really have trouble judging this movie. It's aimed brilliantly, there is obviously a lot of money in it. Genders and Danes are intense (although her screen perspective can use a bit more defining and spicing up), editing and filmography are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of the really really sick movies where you can't wonder if the director likes to stage scenes himself, and it can't be surprising, but how many copycats will such a movie inspire . /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ....
