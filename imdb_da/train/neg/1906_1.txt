They played this on the 4th of July Twilight Zone Marathon, and that's, hands down, the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It is completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Although the Twilight Zone is a rather bumpy series and many episodes end up being ostensibly predictable, it was out of place. Compare this with legendary episodes like "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun" and you realize there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such horrible material, and surprisingly I am surprised that any of his historical comedy stature would stop at the level of this episode. Though he seemed to be giving it some effort, he needs the money ... there is no other explanation.
