The story was very straightforward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. Some of the audience seemed to find fun, but I like more intelligent humor. There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film, and their performances were decent considering the script. Lena Endre was good as always. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the original movie, so I can't tell if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies such as this trip, this movie may be worth a look.
