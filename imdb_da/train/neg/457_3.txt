Sure, I like short cartoons, but I didn't like this. Of course the kids would love it. But then again I am not a child anymore (although I still consider myself young). I don't want to tell anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no story. How is it possible that this cartoon of a cartoon was nominated for an Oscar?! Well ... I think it's because people in their 30s were more satisfied with not much than now. In the present where we live, everything must happen quickly. Look at the movies today and you will come to the same conclusion: We live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. It's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30s because it seems so peaceful. But every time you go up and down, I think ... <br /> To conclude: If you like music (and frogs), you should see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it.
