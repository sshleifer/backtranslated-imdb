I can't believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two rather unmanageable sexual assault scenes. It is as if our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't seem to condemn these attacks - as in, the woman who is repeatedly attacked and pressed, never holds the men accountable for their actions, and no one else does. A man has stopped completing the assault when someone throws a dagger on him, but he is only reprimanded with "you can't force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually, you move". .. From a woman's point of view, the movie is a disappointment. It kind of "throws a leg" for women to let them be both skilled warriors and leaders, but the film is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must imply an imbalance in power where men dominate the woman they love. This amazing martial art fighter doesn't use any of his fighting skills to try to ward off his attackers. She doesn't even excuse them - rather, she seems apologetic. All in all, a depressing and disturbing movie, with some amazing movie pictures and some great fighting scenes, but not as good as Hero with a long shot.
