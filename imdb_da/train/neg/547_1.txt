The movie's full title is "Waqt: Race Against Time". It's a race no one can ever win, but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious "waqt" on this backyard. This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G honest. It strained my fidelity too far. It was ridiculously stupid in its history and deserves to be mocked by it. It's not quite as terrible as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. Stupid, meaningless, with a ridiculous OTT performance by Amitji. The central "plot" is another unpleasant example of the cruel manipulative propaganda that attacks so many "family" BW films. If my father, who raised me and who I love dearly, treated me like Big B did Akshay, I would shoot him himself. To say nothing about trivialization of terminal disease.
