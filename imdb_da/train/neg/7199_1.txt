Why?!! This was an incomplete, uninspired and embarrassing movie. The embarrassment comes from being from the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people do such a BAAAAAD movie there? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and no ROBO. It all changed along with the cuteness courtesy of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic cartoon character. Watching Matthew Broderick make fun of his own movies wasn't fun either. Sheesh !!
