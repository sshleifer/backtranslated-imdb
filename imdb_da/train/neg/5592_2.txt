It is hard to describe this movie and you will try hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have the feeling that this might just be the perfect movie for a 12 year old girl ... <br /> <br / > This film has a good concept - the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It has some pretty dreamy shots and some nice sketches about the young boy's relationship with his single workmate and his treasure friend ... a good start you might say, but then it became a bit greedy, very greedy, it tries to be a science fiction, one drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, adventure, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience, who felt quite inadequate. For example, the scene where the girl (played by Risa Goto) finally awoke from his (Yuki Kohara) kiss, instead of being romantic, is trying to be scary to make us laugh afterwards ... it's a Inexpensive trick because it destroys all expectations and emotions as it tried to build the better half of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story on which the film is based (it is the well-known work of the cartoon artist Osamu Tezuka is famous for its intriguing and intricate stories) I wonder if all the problems are exsist the original story or did it appear in the adaptation? It's quite illogical even for someone who is used to the "fussy logic" of the Japanese cartoon. How did Yuki Kohara's character come to the hospital in an instant (when it is supposed to be a long bus ride away) to run Risa Goto's characters in front of the TV cameras right after he saw her live interview on television? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are directly copied (very uncreative!) from other movies, and yet seem meaningless annoying ie. the famous "Lion's mouth has my hand" scene from "the Roman holiday" <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to be everything but does not end up being something ... it fails to be an adventure and it did not enough jokes to be a comedy ... and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an accidental "ghost movie". Nevertheless, one must give it a credit that it has managed to pay tribute to some of the Japanese teenager. <br /> <br /> It's watching this movie, I have a feeling that there may be some movies that should have a warning label that said "this movie can only be suitable for people under 18 year ", it would certainly be on the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
