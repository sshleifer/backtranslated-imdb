This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last couple of weeks I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this prize from the last 30 years, and I really think this movie might just be the worst of them all - but it wasn't just a nominee but it won !! I suppose that 1989 must have been a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The movie depicts a group of characters resembling a super-glamorous unkind. It appears to be simple articulated characters that have been moved using stop motion animation. Everyone is the same - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on the back. They all stand on a large platform that is suspended, as if in magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins to tilt slightly and in response the men are moving in an attempt to balance the platform. This continues on and on and on and for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them seems pretty nasty to the end, but it's just not enough to make it fun to see at least. Apart from passable stop motion animation, this brief offers nothing of interest to me .... NO. <br /> <br /> Thus, the big short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989, and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a great card and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Couldn't Pixar have entered it? It seems unlikely.
