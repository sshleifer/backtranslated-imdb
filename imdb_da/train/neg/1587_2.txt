Maybe television will be so brutal one day. Maybe ?? Big Brother "was only the first step in the direction of Stephen ?? Richard Bachmann` King described the end point for. But enough about that. If I use too many words to talk about the serious background stamp of this movie, I do exactly what the producers were hoping for by choosing this material. It's the same with the 6th day. No matter how primitive the film is, it evokes a discussion of its subject matter, which serves the producers as advertising. Let's NOT be taken into it. The social criticism suggested by this plot collection is only an alibi that makes it possible to produce a speculative, violent film, more for video sales than for cinema. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the book. I dare not criticize Stephen King without reading him, but when I watched the movie, I thought they could not make such a horrible movie out of a good book: In a typical 1980s, music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger began finds himself a policeman who runs away from killers within a cruel TV show. The audience rejoices. <br /> <br /> Along with ?? Predator` this is certainly Schwarzenegger's most stupid movie. 2 stars out of 10.
