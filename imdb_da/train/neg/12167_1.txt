Despite being a successor to the more potent original, it is more of a comical remake of Friday the 13th about the psychopathic Angel's additional antique and kills more nubile teens for their "immoral" in a camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks good. There are some beautiful fun scenes with some beautiful darn attractive girls, but the movie is so (unintentionally) comic rather than exciting, it's a stinker. <br/> <br /> * out of ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: Classified R for graphic violence and gore, nudity and for sexuality, language and drug use.
