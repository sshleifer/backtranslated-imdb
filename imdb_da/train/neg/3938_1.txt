Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish from a movie. Initially, the manuscript was clearly written for a B movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to get out of the television) and Hutton (looking for "two" of a "one" two strokes "he had hoped to define his career after" Ordinary People ") was attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, big bad cloth from scene to scene (Come on - who uses cloth after 12th grade telecommunication class?), And ordinary old bad act drops this movie. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad plague of action that is this movie. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I have to admit to feeling Duchovny's pain as he reads the lines that are voice-over. Although I was happy that the director wanted me to be scared, I didn't prepare for the last line of Duchonvey's voice-over: "If you ever need a doctor, make sure to call 911. " If only the studio had called 911, this dog's movie would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
