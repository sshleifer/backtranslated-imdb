This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, but for reasons best left to the powers that were. Much seems to have been done by the fact that it is the first Thai language film made with Thai actors and crew, but directed by a Westerner. Didn't have to be honest, as this movie is boring, boring and boring. Why Hint On Something Why Ponder An Idea In Mystery Why Substantially Recall A Feeling When You Can Hammer The Point Home With Terrible Voice Headlines, Clear Shot And Over The Top Scenes> Nothing is back to the imagination as time and time again instructor Spurrier clings clumsy of endless clich√©s. No hinting, no guess, it's totally up on the screen, no need to use our imagination. Wonder when the "scary" bit comes? No, you don't, because the soundtrack is becoming increasingly scary and rising to a crescendo of malicious. Hell, I make words to describe how bad this is. Wondering if the magic demon is real or imaginary? Why treasure yourself - it's really a snake, and yes it's actually biting its step and there's blood splattering everywhere. It's a strange, uncomfortable movie for several reasons. It must be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the forests are signposted and obvious. It can be a frightening attack on Thailand's side, but the director has a blurry, smearing style when it comes to showing scanty teens. Maybe it throws itself as the innocent Western who planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe it was all just pants. Uninspired, insipid, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for best description but boring seem most appropriate and honest. It has all been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. Pardon. Thumbs down on each counter. Really dire.
