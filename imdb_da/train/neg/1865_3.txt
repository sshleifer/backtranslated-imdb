Well, what can I say there are B-Grade Movies and there are B-Grade Movies, and this certainly falls into the latter. But since it is obvious that even the film's makers know that it is not a credible movie (look at the final credits), it can be forgiven. The plot is basically a doomed psycho killer killed. He has accidentally got his genetic material mixed up with an experimental acid that gets combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is after the country town of Sherif, who put him behind bars. That way, Jack Frost stops killing half of the city. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks real scary effects, and the effects alone remind me of B-Grade movies from the 50s. This alone makes it worth looking at a laugh. A movie to pass the time away.
