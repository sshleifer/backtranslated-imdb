The only thing that The First Power really has on the way is that it gives Jeff Kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely range of psychotic villains that he has done so well over the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specialized in these parts back in the 50s. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, The First Power is a soup slasher-flick who has wasted Lou Diamond Phillips as a LAPD detective who has a specialty in capturing serial killers. Kober is his latest catch, but Kober is in a lower strength league and they are going to stop and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober has given the gas chamber, his spirit comes back in all sorts of forms. <br /> <br /> Mycelium Williamson is present as Lous partner who encounters an eerie end involving a demon-possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insight around to help Lou. Will he succeed in fighting forces beyond? <br /> <br /> When movie ends, you no longer care. Lou really got caught in a turkey. Perhaps the devil made him do this movie.
