This was going to be a good movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols instructs. Uh uh. It's boring boring boring! Useless and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter 'boy meet girl, boy marry girl, boy have affair, girl leave boy's story. Now there is an original concept! After turning on for two hours (was it only two? It felt like six.) I wasn't sure if it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I am sure we all did things 16 years ago, which we would rather forget. I hope the damage to Streeps et al. Has begun to heal and the emulsion on the master begins to fade. It's not that it's such a bad picture. It's just that it's such a good one.
