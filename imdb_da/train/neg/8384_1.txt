When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, I thought it was too hard, but little did I know that the low rating was quite correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Wayan's brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed the White Chicks. Little man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were outdated. Of course, the joket will be about Marlon Wayans, who plays an adult midget who was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond intended for a gangster. Things go wrong and the midget has to put the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting pair of doorsteps. Of course he is taken in and the drama begins hunting for the diamond. <br /> <br /> The movie features some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well as from Living Color. However, all these talents cannot help the poor script and jokes that were simply not fun. <br /> <br /> The special effects that make Marlon Wayans look like a midget were OK. I mean, it wasn't 100% credible, but it was OK ... not good. I just wish the Wayans brothers had put more emphasis on developing a script with good jokes than trying to throw their poor script with cameos from their famous comic actors and actresses. Wait for it on cable or TV. It's really not worth any amount of money.
