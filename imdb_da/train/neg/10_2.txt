This movie had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, the director and the editors made this movie serious. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the authors, it could have been good. The actor is wood, very few of the characters are credible. <br /> <br /> Who ever edited this has clearly learned some new editing techniques and wanted to spray them all over the movie. There are lots of fast 'flashy' edits in almost all scenes that are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up being annoying. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and expected to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium, but unfortunately no, it felt like I had wasted my time and the filmmakers had wasted their money.
