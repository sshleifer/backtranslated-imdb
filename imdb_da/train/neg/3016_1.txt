I am, like many, a fan of Tony Scott movies. When this movie came out, I had great hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie is the farthest thing from it! The story drew water from the go, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. And the whole 'arm's scene was for free! <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Kiera Kinghtly and this movie reveals that she never becomes a movie star! The movie brought some of the worst acts ever. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's direction n all but it takes the whole friggin cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!
