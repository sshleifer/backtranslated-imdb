It has very bad plays. Bad story lines. Bad signs. You should never see this show if you watch it. TURN IT OFF. Or you will be cringing for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been sent. It's not amazing. You should never see it. NEVER EVER. So now, if you ever want to see this show, don't do it. Turn to THE CW for Smallville. Or the Disney Channel to Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, These are much better family shows. So believe me in this, I've seen it before. And that's honest, and I honestly say, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV. So do me a favor and never look at this show.
