This is a thorough review of the pilot section as it appears on DVD. Television removed my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - meaning I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler warning) <br /> <br /> The pilot in Moonlighting is your basic "hollower who meets fluffball" yarns, where a "charming" red blooded man manipulates a lost woman to Realize what she really wants and needs. The premises on which the script's "wit" is based must already have been outdated around 1950. It also contains some honestly bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie hits the furniture instead of shooting the villain to prove herself to Woman who has need for masculine help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts to seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped over it. <br /> <br /> In a way, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: In addition to the pilot episode, it features the screen test that landed Willis's job. Both features indicate the great extent of Willis' working ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I'm a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
