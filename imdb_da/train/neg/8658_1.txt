A large part of the scenes must be cut off. There are many scenes that should have been cut off. For example, the scene where the hunters mention "I have spiders on my cock", "I like cock" is playing in the mudflat or a bar scene where a professional dinocrocier's main job is a snake tub. <br /> <What about other terribly incoherent scenes with a woman, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity to a girlfriend who goes as he wears women's panties three sizes too small. While they love, they did not understand that they did it next to the little boy who would soon run away and lose his head? Why did they live in a living room? I mean his head really turned around. What about the beach scene reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene on Grant Lake. All of these weird scenes could easily be renamed and billed as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my local town, the cineplex theaters advertised months on Dinocroc, and I'm glad I didn't see it because I later found out that it was only shown for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The movie was so bad. I assumed that Dinocroc was not a good movie that looked at the previve. It has the leg of Dinocroc, which looks like a baby wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and goes up and down like a 2 year old. It could easily go over like Baby Geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any student with film production wants to learn what not to do, this is a real classic bin. As Diana's boyfriend goes as he had an advanced case of syphilis, you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks full even before he gets to drink beer. When does it happen, who cares about Dinocroc? The pussy man looked more interesting than the whole movie of Dinocroc. His performance was so bad he made a much better replacement for Mr. Bean. FLY OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here's a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick. Perhaps the worse casting in Hollywood's history.
