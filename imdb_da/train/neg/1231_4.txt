Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is an over-class housewife living in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her violent husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all twins attention, neglects their house and her appearance and disturbs Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, she drives to the local mall at night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts and she finds no parking available. When she sees an old car parked on two spots, she leaves a message to the owner who calls him "selfish jerk". When the mall closes, Della's car is held by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks ?? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the guard in the mallet protects her, he is shot on the head by Chuckie, Della accelerates her car trying to escape the criminals. But she rushes her truck near a forest while chasing the gang. She takes the toolbox and hides in the woods and fights against the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, I saw the trailer of "While She Was Out" and I was eager to watch the DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this boring and incredible collection of clichés. Della Myers is presented as an insecure and negligent housewife and involuntarily as a wife; Maternity is her only interest in her concept of family. She is chased by four average criminals, but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be Batman's help belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The bands of criminals are formed by the favorite cliché of American films, with an African American, a Chinese-American, and a Latin along with an American gentleman to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent act, but their children are too young for a twenty-five year old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While she was out")
