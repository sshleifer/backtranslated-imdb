I have given this show (I have only seen seven episodes) four stars because most of its jokes / setups seem to fail. Some are not fun, but some are entertaining - in a 12-year-old boy kind. She reminds me of the New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it too much money. Silverman knocks out what she has, including the kitchen sink, asking for some things to stick to the wall in her attempt to be fun but different. But what she has often "gotten" is not enough as if she lacks that kind of follow-up, a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole business is like a sub-potato.
