I will not argue for anyone who pronounces this movie execrable as it is January Jones's performance, but please check her out if you have not already been in the AMC television series Mad Men, which will start later this month. She is excellent as it is all thrown. I would surely assume that she took the role of "Taboo" cleanly and to realize what a bad mess it was to become, a minimal play to avoid hunger. know if that is the case, but I (now) surely know she can act. <br /> <br /> At first seeing "Taboo" I was convinced that her flat delivery was a sharp choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or plot. Not so lucky. It was hard to believe that the instructor had not suggested at least once that not changing expressions of 17 consecutive scenes could cause lockjaw. Ironically, her winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a sign that at least in her early appearance is very repressed, reserved, uncertain of herself and rather colorless, not unlike her "Taboo" role. But as the television series evolved, she began to blossom into a person questioning her traditional early 60s white-bread morality. Can't wait to see where they take her character in the second season. <br /> In summary, avoid "Taboo" as leprosy, but definitely check "Mad Men".
