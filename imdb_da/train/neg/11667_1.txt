This film was a great disappointment over direction, intellectual level, plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting. It's a slow moving movie set as an episode of Wonder Years, with scary lack of depth itself. It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner. The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective expression as "beauty". According to the actors in this movie, 'beauty' can only be experienced in Bob-Ross style kitschy landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by using basic (as primary school) color theory and lots of emotions. In parts, the film is offensive, e.g. At one point it is called (rather celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally disabled people are unable to have feelings or express them through painting, their works are per. definition worthless "bullshit" (quote). <br /> <br /> I don't understand how the movie could get such a high rating, so again, so far, many have not rated it and they chose only very high or very low ratings.
