Why bother watching this movie if you have good movies to watch. It's a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad to see it. Everything in it is bad. The actors were bad. Script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI ever. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. An interesting thing that is a characther that we want to die because he is so stupid that we get enough of him. (I can't remember the name, but was BOYFRIEND of the selected one.) <Br /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 stars out of 10
