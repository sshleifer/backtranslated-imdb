Elizabeth Taylor couldn't act at all and she was just her usual annoying, unlikely even in this movie. This was before she got so fat, but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict, but clearly an actor with more excitement like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly showed that he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and goes on for too long. The actors were too young and light and none of them became convincing because of the bad makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous that he was just cushioned and Dean and Carroll Baker were of course the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
