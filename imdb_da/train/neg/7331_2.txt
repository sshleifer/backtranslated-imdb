This movie was clearly done badly and in a rush. I realize that the financing of such a movie is hard to come by. But if the plot had any kind of original fabric, someone would have seen it get the necessary funding, it wasn't the case, and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no meaning in existing ones. The reason for this movie has been done and done better, I can add, many times before. There is no need to make a movie that has no chance of competing with others. I was informed by my computer that I need at least ten lines to submit my comment, so the following lines are just bullied to fill space. In my opinion, there is no need for anything else to say about this movie. What I've said is plentiful, and if you wasted enough time to read this review, don't forget more time watching this movie than God's sake. The only exception here is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies being played on women's entertainment network at 2:00 am. In that case, see what I care about.
