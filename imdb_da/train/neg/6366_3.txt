There was not a single redemption factor in this movie. My girlfriend and I both love action movies. Especially fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were amazing), but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is an uneasy character who has seen struggle and thus forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The army has disturbed its bowel movements in addition to completing its fighting technique. The music is also not good. They fight against rap and hip-hop style on the streets, because these guys are bullies. The rest of the audio track is the usual background noise for low budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B-style. The actors deliver their lines as if they read them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and leave burning in some rotten Hollywood street. The film is called "Honor", but there was no honor in making this film. It was simply a waste of money and using wisely is something I consider to be honorable. <br /> <br /> See Felon instead. Battle scenes and situations are more real.
