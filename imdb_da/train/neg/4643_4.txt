I rented this movie on DVD. I knew the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but when I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts quite well, with the assumption that snuff films are sent over cable. However, the protagonist has nothing about her to get you upset at all, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are too many unanswered questions. There was a big scene at the end which totally surprised me, but overall this is a much under par movie, but I think it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
