A bum gives a secret serviceman a tip for a secret servant in the President's details who are planning to kill the president. Baloney. How did the boom know? The script then turns to a most detailed study of how Secret Service works, but who cares. Most of this only lowers the film. All the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiring movie car films. Then, after a lot of impossible athletics, where our hero and out-guns all his friends, we have a shootout in Toronto City Hall. The canads are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get into this? Finally everything is prepared. But it still makes no sense.
