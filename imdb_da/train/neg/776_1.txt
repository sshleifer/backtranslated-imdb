I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather downloaded the video for free in the mall. I remember it really sucked. The reason had no meaning. I hated the fox who became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried his head if he couldn't find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part, and I don't want to sound medieval, was when the fox was shot and died at the end. I laughed my head in payback because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is that the fox re-emerges and becomes a ghost. I wish he had died. I think I even gave the video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offer it for free at the mall. If you have a child, don't let them see this. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
