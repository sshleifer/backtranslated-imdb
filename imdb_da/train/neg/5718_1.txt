There was no characterization in this film and really shows how much this unpretentious hack led this need to learn his craft. All his characters in this movie were so unlikely and I could fit less. The best point in this movie was the final credits and hour-long shower after that reason, I felt so dirty that I wasted money on this stinking load. Hey genius .... triads and yakuza are from two different places learning something about Asian culture. The dog's scene in this felt so dressed and useless. This DVD turns out to be useful I love my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So children don't waste your money on this crap buy hostel instead.
