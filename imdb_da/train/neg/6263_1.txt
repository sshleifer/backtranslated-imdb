Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a mess from Troma. This is a young, sloppy and stupid low budget war movie about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion. The professor's evil assistant entices the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform horrible experiments. Using a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely braindead piece of garbage that contains lots of nudity and some cheesy gore, not to mention a ridiculous musical score. is terrible, and the manuscript is completely incoherent. Why such a piece of shit is widespread is beyond me. Avoid it as bothered.1 out of 10.
