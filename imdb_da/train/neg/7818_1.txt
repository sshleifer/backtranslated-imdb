I don't usually go out of a movie, but halfway through I did it. This movie promised something different, but I kept thinking, haven't I seen it before? Spoiler Alert! Back in 1, the spaceship goes down and lands on the ground, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn up and collapse! What can this advanced civilization not seem to develop landing gear? For an industry so liberal, we see another Woody Allen movie, no black roof! Superman runs around to save people, make sure he stays with Europe and the United States, doesn't go into dark areas, please. Maybe I could forget this 30 years ago, but now.
