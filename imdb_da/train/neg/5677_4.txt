"Seed" is torture porn ... no doubt about it. But strangely, Uwe Boll has written, produced and directed a more polished film than anyone else he has made in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a Boll movie, I feel some pages of script have disappeared. There are simply big gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, there is nothing that makes sense either. The files are somewhat surreal in this regard. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> Why do the six police officers go to seed up and go their separate ways when they come to the dark residence, unlike real police who would come in and clear the house for couple or three years? Why does the police never use their radios? How can organs fall so quickly, a process that usually takes many months? (I know it's time-consuming photography ... but Seed would never be able to keep on going to kill people if he always waited for the former victim to fall to the point shown.) How does Seed come to wear bib overalls and a mask while waiting for death row instead of typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a maximum security prison, walk around the cell block and then go out again without being stopped or even noticed? If nearly 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) have been murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide to go to Seed at Seed's house, where he was initially arrested and where he murdered his victims? (Didn't he think of doing so before?) Why does the police detective without a backup and without letting the ship know what he was doing and where he was leading? <br /> <br /> This is particularly frustrating when, of course, Boll goes a long way from his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He uses several screen minutes to set this as he could have used them to make other aspects of the movie at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> In short, the movie serves as a framework for a few different scenes (maybe Boll would think of these as his " visions ") of a brutal death by bludgeoning, shots on the head, execution by electrocution, and the shelling of live animals raised to their skins. (The animal's opening scenes were actually unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the movie.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a middle-aged woman at Seed using a hatchet. It is obvious that much time was spent on this, and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs" but without the Steely Dan soundtrack. Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a dedicated torture porn genre fan or if you are determined to see a torture porn sample. As I said at the beginning of this review, though this film is quite disgusting and can be ill at points, it is really much more competent than most of Boll's films. Perhaps he will continue to improve as the film maker. I can only hope that he progresses over the torture porn and continues more in "Posten's friend".
