This movie is outdated and misses the mark. It's far away from the 89 Batman that it is trying to coppy. The fact that women are singing what she is called cannot work, and we see why her film bearer died. Note how this movie died in the cashier's office, no one sees this movie on TV either. My uncle and father waited for Batman, and the movie impression is more like Cop Rock. Not worth renting 3/10
