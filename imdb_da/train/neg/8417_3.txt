I expected the release of the movie as much as any fan of the Broadway game. I waited and read reviews for months about the award-winning performances. I mean by the star force of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was absolutely disappointed with the finished product. The movie did not match the publicity hype it was given, and the only rescue graps were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance saves the movie just as it hits its multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's performance forces you to pay attention every time she is on the screen. Her notion of "And I tell you" was the only time I felt the hype was deserved. You scared when she asked him no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. As many reviewers have said, she steals the film from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she receives for this achievement. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comic talent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles cross through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this movie seemed to anticipate his extraordinary "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles was in an expanded way of shooting or video capturing, posing and shimming through the movie. Her performance wasn't strong enough to make you interested in her character at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was too hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "heartfelt" solo for Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
