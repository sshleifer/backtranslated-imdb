Although not exactly offensive, the 1967 version of "The Perils of Pauline" is certainly moronic. The title could lead you to expect a tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in 1914 silent 20 episode serial), but for that you would be better served by the 1947 version starring Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like a mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of the Elvis movies. Worst of all, it's not a mix of these, but more like some scotch-taped segments from each, so things go back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> Which unit is in production comes from the pairing of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a great match because both lack even the most basic trading skills (imagine Mandy Moore plays opposite Dan Quayle). <br /> <br /> Austin would later play opposite John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade", with the talent difference between those who were actually painful to see. In the mid 60's, she was the "Dodge Rebellion" girl, as such, she was highlighted in a similar series of dangerous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit. When the automaker's advertising agency replaced her with the "Dodge Fever" girl, someone got the bright idea to show her in a feature film. <br /> <br /> What story is here begins with Pauline growing up in Baskerville Founding Home, run by the actor who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. on "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline-not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages several options she needs to be adopted. George leaves to seek his happiness and 19-year-old Pauline gets a job teaching in a young oil boarder Austrian prince. As he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem, she runs away and goes from danger to danger. It is about African pygmies, a 99Â½-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is supposed to be silly and charming, but only controls the silly part. There is some effort to incorporate a silent movie into action sequences by simulating a camera's undercurrent (which speeds up the action). Unfortunately, everything else (movie storage, production design, editing) is depressing in the 1960s. Nothing here even approaches the pictures of Pearl White attached to a log moving towards a trouser or tied to the track track waiting for the nearby train. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
