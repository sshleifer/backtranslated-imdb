Five minutes in this movie, you realize you've seen it all before. It's chamber room. It's FIRM. And it is DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there are no new items here. Except for that clearly Bill Gates allegory. Conpsiracies are always good things for film making, but why should it be so extreme? Boiler room is a good movie because it - for a while - seems realistic. In antitrust everything is wrong. For example, how realistic is your boss paying a scammer to be your girlfriend to make you work harder and control you? I would give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
