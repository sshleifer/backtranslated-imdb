Two sisters, their perverted brother and their cousin have car problems. Then they are about Dr. Hackenstein's home, which comfortably needs the body's parts of three nubile young women to use in an attempt to bring his late lover back to life. He tells them he helps them come home in the morning, so they stay overnight. So the good doctor comes down to work in this low budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this to be mildly fun, not at all going out of your way (I stumbled across Netflix instant view and streamed it to Xbox 360) but better than I expected it to be for a Troma acquired movie. Most of the humor does not work, but theirs are still some parts that made me smile. Plus the late, big Anne Ramsey has a small portion and she was always a good experience to see. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Bambi Darro & Sylvia Lee Baker got topless <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
