This is a very cheap made werewolf flick. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the hard detective who shoots werewolves with his silver gun! [filled of course with silver balls]. The plot is like wood as the characters. FX is non-existent, lots of extreme close-ups of washers and biting. The only thing shown is lots of soft-core T&A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe, you'll have to see a really good recent wrap image: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
