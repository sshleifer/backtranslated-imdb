'Flight Of Fury' is a shockingly bad but worst of all boring Action Movie - I don't expect much from a Seagal movie. All I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with a little thoughtless action - unfortunately it doesn't do not even achieve the low expectation. The action scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is completely irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with large plot holes throughout. The action is really abysmal - bordering on embarrassing Seagal and his whispering One Expression performance is the best of the enchanting parties of 3. Raters - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $ 12M was spent on this gloomy mess, Unless the $ 11M of the 12 was Seagal's Salary - I somehow doubt it! One moment of interest for just boys or gay girls is that there are apparently no two hot chicks in a lesbian sex scene of a kind complete with big baps on the screen except that - these are mediocre things that don't separate many by Michael Dudikoff B-movies I have exhibited <br /> <br /> 1/10
