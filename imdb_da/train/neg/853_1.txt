Okay, I honestly don't see why everyone thinks this is so good. It really is not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can tip my hat to him. 2. Danna's performance, he was good. Nothing but that was pretty stupid. And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking of drafting Shelly as Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she was scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have been more respectful of it if Kubrick had finished it differently. And it all over the film was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So don't watch the movie read the book and you get much better. 10.3.
