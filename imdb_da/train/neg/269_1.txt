After seeing the first ten episodes, I have to say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in California so we could have had scenes in the desert. It would have been more true in the movie. The first scene where they are out in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. It doesn't feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it feels as if they are running around fighting foreigners in a Canadian forest. And it is so lamb that appaerantly, on other planets, comes autumn also. You can see leaves on the ground in the woods, all of which look like forest outside of Vancouver. It just makes the show even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He's no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russel's performance a bit, but he's just not as cool as Russel. And not as well an actor as Russel. And Russell's way of playing O Neill, well, he was much more cynical. Anderson's O Neil, is too soft. I liked that Russel's version just didn't give a s *** and had no trouble detonating the bomb to the very end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson, even though he takes over James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a very annoying sign. He's Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c speaks lectures and acts as a robot. I've seen better plays by Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and Ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak English suddenly is also incredibly stupid. What made foreigners so scary in the movie was that they spoke an old language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> With regard to the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the show itself are poorly finished and look cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they are walking around on a soundstage with a poorly crafted painting in the background. It is an insult to us viewers that they made it so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The X files had better effects as they voted their first episodes in 1993. It was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did not have the apparent budget of $ 2 million a year. Episode that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spent all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. Incredibly boring and pointless show, it could have been good if they had shot the Hollywood show with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
