Why every horror director wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is a complete mystery to me when William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated movie and in my opinion not all that excited or shocking. And yet here is another pure rip-off, a Spanish once here who shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl obsessed with pure evil and turning to her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite warm here) plays the honorable priest who is approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new girlfriend. Initially, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is discovered with his throat twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... "exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, it is also an insufficiently dull movie! Here, Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religious theme exploitation game filled with shock and do, yet the result is a tame and totally bloodless drama that will almost sleep you! The last twenty minutes include some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there are quite a few stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse when Paul Naschy has already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a lack of money. This is just a horrible movie, the end of the story. Other European "Excorcist" rip-offs are "Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they also suck!
