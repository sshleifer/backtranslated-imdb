OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> About two brothers. Max, the younger, has a great cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie supposes to show the leap from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make it possible. It does not, however. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be. Most of the movie focus is on Max and his dismissive ways. Eventually Adam, can no longer take the stress off his job and start using it too (perscription drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no climax. Do not rise to what cocaine really does for you, have boring and low-budget scenes, and the actions of the oldest brother, Adam, are frightening. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass on and receive prizes, it's not a heart-wincher. If you want a clear and true story movie in the extreme world of drug rentals, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you will enjoy it. Try and see for yourself ...
