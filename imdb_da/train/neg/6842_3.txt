"Paula, I can be a bitch, but I never become a butch!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiring skin girl who has a beautiful honey in Stacey Walker, but it's all about it. This gal is a real teasing that entices her lovers, colleagues and even his lesbian roommate Paula into her bedroom, but then becomes a whack job that cries "rape" and calls on the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified c ** t is interesting for a little while, but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one-leg affair. At least, the end is worth waiting for those who still want to take care of that time.
