Revenge is one of my favorite themes in movies. Moreso, "the wickedness of vengeance" is one of my favorite themes in film. Having seen Gaspar Noes Irreversible (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weakly half-hearted attempt that only expressed the film's lack of conviction and focus. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The final scene, a free male male rape / torture scene, came across as nothing short of a female revenge rape fantasy. However, the film does not even follow this. Instead, the drawn-out scene (as FAR exceeds the rape of the original rape both to the extent that it was graphic and as it was ritualized) crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of either regret or "This did not 'Fix anything "while the rape of the rape is heard in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not a shock but a confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get to the audience. Are we angry with it? Are we angry with it? Do we feel Dawson's moment of regrettable clarity? Apart from this, the film is really kind of awkward paced with more style than fabric. monotonous, etc. Usually, I try to take movies on their own terms, but Descent didn't really know what they were.
