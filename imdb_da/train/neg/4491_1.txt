1/10, and that's only because I'm not going lower with my reviews. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie in the "Trilogy", don't buy or rent it. Believe me, you will not lack a thing. The architect does not bring any new info: _ (spoiler) - there have been several NEOs before him, he is like No. 6 or something. You could already figure out something like that from the first movie: Agent Smith tells us that the first matrix that was created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where have I seen this before? Oh in the first movie roles turned around! The same as the action scenes is nothing new with more opponents. The action scene (the 20+ ships) in the BIG fight, which we didn't see (maybe in revolutions?) Betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy who kept the knife who wanted to stab Neo?!) Who shot EGM button soon. <br /> <br /> All in all, a shameless trick to making money (especially from the boys who went to see it more than once), which apparently served as a charm.
