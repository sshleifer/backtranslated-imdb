Not that I want to be private, but this movie surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie I was like ... erm ... what is this movie about? I don't get the animations at all. Probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. During the film, a group of people have gone out. After the movie, many people said, "That's it?" Frankly, I can't believe this movie was awarded to the best movie prize for children. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend you. You will regret it. I'm not making fun. You will find that you are just wasting your time and money on you and seeing it.
