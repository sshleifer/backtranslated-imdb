This movie deserved a job over the Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth looking at because it is an unintentional grin. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All Monsters." Be sure to check out the following: The Cheesy Medallion (it looks like Shriners has been here), the obvious polyester Norfolk jacket on Allan Quatermain, David MaCallum's badly made butt (which makes the attention away from his even worse acting) the incredibly bad process working on all the "monsters", the monsters themselves - the towel that scares the little girl, the giant snake that scares Macallum while sinking into oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes of the motorized crabs, the incredibly hilarious boat (oh, brother! !), which seems to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and resembles a leftover from a Jr.Sr. prom ("Until the future with the class" 71), the Phoenician city - where they carry Roman imperial armor, but which inexplicably have Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come on!) and worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with his screaming wig) plays the smoochy-face -h horror! The best part is that the creepy explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman, and the African guy - Snupupagus or whatever - obviously chose to die all the way to being in multiple stages.
