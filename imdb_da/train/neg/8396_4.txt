... but I've also seen it better. The story here is predictable - a movie staff trying to film a horror movie in a place where murder occurred. Three guesses what happens. This is not a total bomb - the throw is pretty good with the pros John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine, who give the best performances. It is reasonably well made - for a low budget movie. Just don't expect any nudity, sword, blood OR gore (the movie has a very mild PG rating). I was never quite bored - it is OK to look at a quiet night. I watched it on video - it was a terrible print - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Yet I didn't hate it, and it has a cool end that surprised me - basically nothing happens until then, so it catches you away. Worth to see, but only if you are a horror movie complete.
