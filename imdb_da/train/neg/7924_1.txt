Ted V. Michael's film Corpse Grinders 2 is a 103 minute outrageous cinematic swim. The reason is pretty much a mixture of inconsistent business relationships among people who mimic cat food while cat foreigners who lose a war with dog families seeking to get some of this cat food. In this movie I began to look for any kind of distraction, something to assure myself that I was doing something other than losing my mind from within. Several scenes go on for too long as signs take forever to do simple things. I have heard that Mr Mikels does not like to use bouncer too often, afraid they will confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid." Try as I might, I couldn't break any of the characters in the unnecessarily large throw, well with the possible exception for the old men who are the manufacturers at the factory. The majority of the cast is a bunch of no talent amateurs who do not even interfere with learning the lyrics of "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing it on the camera. Although the blame may have to go to the poor sound quality, since I only heard about 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. It's probably the worst movie ever shot. I have listened to comments from the comment, and Mr Mikels comes as a surprisingly sweet old man, what in the hell did he make this kind of garbage? I would like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to be shirtless on a metal band waiting to get up. Movies I have long hated suddenly seem much better. I long for Excalibur's intermittent appropriate music and the consistent illumination of Dawn of the Dead. I need to do something. Don't watch this movie.
