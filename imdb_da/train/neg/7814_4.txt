After a long period of space, looking for the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who was married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) draws a vicious plan using crystals he stole from solitude fortress to create a new land and immerse the United States. <br /> <br /> After so many wonderful movies from Superman with unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created for Superman's return in this Bryan Singer version. Unfortunately, the horrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overstated in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is somewhat shamefully ridiculous. The twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth mistakenly fails, plays the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville". The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a stupid caricature. Last but not least, and despite being a fantastic Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, that is, older and older than the rest of the lead group. Corny conclusion resembles a soap opera and is horrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
