This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a large movie. Nothing new or original is added other than Perry's feedbacks, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary sense of the first movie and the urgent speed that made it so effective. Also painfully lacking is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added a lot to the original movie. I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. It's pretty bad. Why waste some time or money doing bad things like this, and why did I waste time watching it?
