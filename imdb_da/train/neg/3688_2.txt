As usual, I went to see this movie for A.R. Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his movie career with this movie, it would be successful. But fortunately or unfortunately, the film was a failure. Then he delivered a hit with Chandramukhi. I am eagerly waiting for his coming to come to Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I've read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting as the user is also from TN. Rajni is an actor who believes, from his heart, not from his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we should appreciate Rajni for his strong going in his age. <br /> <br /> Any way I need to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so wish you luck Rajni ...... .....
