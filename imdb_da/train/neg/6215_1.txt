This was really a waste of time ... the movie has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes .... although the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might be interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. The same plot has been played over and over, but what made it worse was that the big plot hole was the whole story of how to kill the evils ... The author could have done so much more with the whole concept, but thought he or She didn't have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> All in all, too much hype but not able to deliver.
