I had the (wrong) fortune to watch this movie on a show in the US. Having reluctantly put through the whole thing immensely, I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. It mounted itself in the early seventies, after the 1969 revolution thing; This movie just stinks of ......., yes, nothing right. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a badly made perfume advertisement - see what I mean? Madonna could never act and have been embarrassed on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse in each of the years that are increasingly looking like a leather meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who has built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, could never look either - his movie is shallow, badly carved, fashion shows. He doesn't disappoint either here either; He wisely threw his wife as the star of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please people, beware of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below. They are clearly business plants. <br /> <br /> Don't encourage Ritchie to humiliate herself further by giving him money. <br /> <br />
