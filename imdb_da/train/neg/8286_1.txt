- = contains spoiler from both original and movie versions = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre dame De Paris musical, I also read book this summer, and I watched movies today, in the beginning I was hoping to see a good movie, especially when i saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good, but i actually waited for the theaters scene directly from the book, but it was normal, but since Esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong .. they not even kiss in book, even in musical .. and there was huge hole, why Esmeralda is judged by wizard, in the book she learns her goat, how to answer the number of clock or write words "phoebus". wait there was a phoebus wasn't there? in this movie he is no soldier junk anymore, the creators made Quasimodo's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo's love. But Notre Dame was Frollo. his thoughts his struggle between love of god and love of man in film we can not find anything like that, all we have is a villain who is really bad and kills people who collide with his thoughts .. and does not mention phoebus and mentor not love for frollo, not to mention jehan (brother of frollo) who does not mention the mother of esmeralda (maybe it's ok, the story would have cut a lot) they didn't even mention the real story .. (another PS: Frollo wasn't an opus dei or some cult member he is actually interested in alchemy, he is trying to make gold, he was stuck in science and religion) finally did not see this movie, it is a kind of executive edition for real masterpiece, and if you have seen it, Before reading the book, God has mercy on you. You must read to order immediately. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II's animated movie, spending your time watching Notre dame De Paris musical .. probably said ..
