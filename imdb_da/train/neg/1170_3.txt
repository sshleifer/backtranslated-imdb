As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies of contemporary war between the sexes, I was very eager to see "Lady and Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" for how he would treat men and women during a real war, French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie looks beautiful, with each scene designed as a period painting, as a tableaux vivant. And I was expecting a lot to speak, as it is Rohmer's style. But perhaps Rohmer was detained by basing the manuscript on a real woman's writings, which most felt like a docudrama version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel." <br /> <br /> As terrible as Robespierre et al. some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I kept myself numb: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor are getting poor;" You could also choose a tune from "Les Miz." I was not as sympathetic as the central figure going back and forth between her townhouse and country manor to stay ahead of the revolution. At one point, her girl demands that the pawnshop is bar, but it surely succeeds in putting a fine repast. I simply did not understand her, an English sympathizer who deviates and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution continue to shift political focus; I think I should sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations as a sign out of "The Scarlet Pimpernel." Hi, the only reason she didn't come home was her disgrace after an affair and a child with the Prince of Wales or someone. <br /> <br /> Normally in a revolutionary period there is some reason to change in the relationship between men and women, but I saw no one here. I once went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture that ended with a long-lasting Q&A; The last question, from an audience that was much older than the rest of us, said she had gray hair, was "Why are revolutionaries so grim?" She was hooted on, and Marcuse wasn't thrilled to respond seriously - but that's the only thing I remember all night long. Rohmer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also gloomy and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written 8/11/2002)
