This 2003 made for television films was obviously shown on a women's channel. As a man, why am I even trying to see this? I don't know, but I have to examine my head. And director and writer Simon Gornick was ashamed of himself for giving men an injustice as he does. He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having more boring women make him in. Number one drilling is Joyce Hyser as the wife. I couldn't wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was stupid and stupid and very confusing throughout most of the film. The second femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you would ever like to meet. Her appearance did not guarantee that our senior man went over her and her action was so obvious that only a fool could miss. Absolutely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on the recording with regard to the slam that seduced his own man, played again as a guy who is a loser by David DeLuise. Rounding off our roll of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl on our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero or should I say victim was not so good. At first I thought he was a bad actor, but later I thought so. He never got part of the ground and was repeated throughout. Although, as a man, I was furious when the two women got away with it. Men, watch out for this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder. LMN is the channel. Beware. Note: After seeing this another time by mistake, I'm convinced of my first thoughts. Especially on the author / director, Simon Gornick. I still think he has argued the male species and should be horse whipped. The only thing that saves grace in this movie is Tembi Locke, who doesn't have a chance to show her talents with the horrific appearance of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and his vacant stars in it. Please LMN does not show this trite again.
