This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a combo drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett investigating a shootout at a hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The reason is constructed and there are far too many side issues going on. Ford is hustling real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients) who runs a yoga school where he is busy chickens in his spare time, the two are under investigation of internal affairs, Ford scratches ex-girlfriend (lena Olin) by the IA investigator, and she is a psychic who has a radio program, is the man who put the killing in the club, a dirty ex-cop who shot Hartnet's father many years ago. <br /> <br /> Toss in compulsory car tickets and some faint humor attempts, and it's about the core of this turkey.
