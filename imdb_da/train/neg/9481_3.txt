James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a `mental illness facility 'for a medical residency with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There he realizes that many trainees are killed by `The Ripper 'who takes their souls to the devil, in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and carefree that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, the blonde fiance of James Bishop arrives at asylum, that it is almost unbelievable that an author has had the courage to include them in a manuscript. And what about James's return to the hospital to bring the dead patients' files? And cast, composed of ham actors and actresses? Honestly, I don't know what or who is worst in this movie: the manuscript, the director or the cast. The correct answer is definitely all of them. I saw this flick on cable TV, and I'm surprised how a producer can spend money on such waste. This horror movie becomes very fun considering the absurdity of the plot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Dem√¥nio '(` Devil')
