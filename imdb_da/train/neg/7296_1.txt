Columbo movies have gone downhill for years, this year it may have bottomed out. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes across as creepy in this movie. As is common in this series, crime protocols are unheard of, so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro hides the landscape and draws pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty convincing lady man. (His weakness was, however, a hoot!) The writing was of the numbers and its delivery patronage. They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties, left us all with one or two good memories of smart plots, better scripts and sharp characterizations.
