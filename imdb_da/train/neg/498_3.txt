I watched this movie when I was much younger, and I thought it was fun. I saw it again last week and you can guess the result. Some fun parts in it, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that is fun if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a total b movie, this is a good choice but don't expect too much from foreigners dwarf size
