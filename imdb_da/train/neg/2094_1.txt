I had to endure teens, high school anxiety and family conflict for almost the entire show. I really don't care about high school girls fretting about their relationship. I have spent my time in hell dealing with such problems and I care nothing about fictional teenies through "little" versions of the horrors I endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. We finally see a proto-cylinder. It was good, but with a problem. Its red-eye dot would lock on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red-eye dot never ceases to move back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope the authors solve this abuse before the second episode.
