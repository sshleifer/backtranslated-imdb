With no flaws to the actors (they all made great achievements), the overall story was not so well done. The movie opens with a big zinger: A crazy old guy strengthens a young aboriginal girl's car away from the road. But then we have to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... and we do not know why until the 40 minutes are up. It turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> While history is picking up at that time, it really doesn't go anywhere. After 2 hours I asked myself: Was there a point on this or was it just to see the characters struggling with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. Although it is well-acted, there is not a strong enough spine in the film to warrant recommending it.
