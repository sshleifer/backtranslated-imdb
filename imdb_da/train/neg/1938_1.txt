Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for 33+ years ... he <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically transmitted home? <br /> <br /> B) Did a nice Pakistani guard ask him to send it to him? <br /> <br /> C) They allow conjugal visits to secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All of the above <br /> <br /> E) Producers had suffered too much bhang on <br / > <br /> the time they approved the script <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - he is yum, yum, yummy ... and he seems to have her - who would Not really ?! ... But when her father steers out and then killed (I hardly think it's a "spoiler" that you have to be brain-dead and blind to not see this coming in the movie) he is pretty numb to this disaster and with the tip (metaphorical) of his hat, leaving her behind to save her father, do not remember her loss and say (paraphrasing) "If God wants it, we meet again" ... Basically means "I'll get my father a d My job done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- Callus in addition to even low-life Hollywood standards ... <br /> # 3) There are so many gaps in this terrible waste of Time called a movie that you can drive all jeeps, trucks camels and any extra stuff through it. Pass - really, completely and totally a waste of time - Oh! There is a fantastic dance sequence (yes only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dance - but not worth looking just for this. Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting?) For better indo-pack conflict movie ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty damn good - 7.5 / 8 I'd say!
