Some may say something like "Baby Geniuses" with its gigantic robot children or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the prize for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You can also say that, but you wanted it wrong. See and see, because I bring to you: Santa Claus, the most helpless messed up family movie since ... well ever. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world, singing their eerie theme song (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin 'minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the excitement conclusion where Merlin emerges from the outside and saves the day (not against him he is from Barcelona), this is childhood damage at his best. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can't ... get ... them ... cleans ... laughter ... out of it. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this bending piece of garbage as if you would avoid a sex-starved whale during the party season. Still, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of overpowering flu are for you, I think you should try. But really, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
