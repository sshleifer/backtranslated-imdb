When you want the dragon to eat every cast member, you know you're in a bad turn. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the other comments, I went in with very, very low expectations and was not let down. However, unlike some other inexpensive and unsuccessful films, it does not remain fun (and unintentional) fun throughout. <br /> <br /> -POILING THE FOLLOWING - <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is very inconsistent. Looking past the "small" errors that the dragon grows up in 3 hours, the whole idea on which it is based is destroyed. See, the movie wants us to think dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show some peasant poking on one with his pitchfork and the dragon emerges. Later, the obligatory "crazy scientist" speaks about how dragons survive the dinosaurs. So apparently people were around when dinosaurs were, or we just got a nice little plot hole here. The other big thing is that the lab is blown up with a force "half as strong" as that used for Hiroshima. So two boys later go in to check out everything and it's almost unharmed! There is even another dragon who grew out of who knows what. All in all, it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned the cloning, I guess they would clone a dragon. This means that our Mr. Smarty Pants Security Player is not as intuitive and clever as the movie would have you believe if you ignore that I knew this movie would know you know dragons. <br /> <br /> Putting it aside is the second worst thing "special effects". Others have mentioned the false rocks that fall in the beginning, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little better than a blob, but it ruined what it was when it pulled down at the same time time after time. For their credit, the flying kites initially looked OK from far away (although in the cave it's probably the worst in the whole movie.) These things are fun to watch. The scenes where a million different shots of the same person are facing different ways are not. There are also no "introductory" screens with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> Come to the actors, they weren't the biggest, but at least I think they tried? They seemed more excited about what they did than many of the players who participated in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for it. One thing I noticed was, however, that the woman playing Meredith often had the face covered in makeup, there were many tones lighter than the rest of her. She looked as though she had a bad penetration with some white face. The script is poor and cheesy. You don't really notice the music, but it is actually not so bad for the most part. The bottom line is not to see it unless you want to see it because you hear it is bad (as if I did), although the only fun things are the bad CG effects. Other than that, don't waste your time and money.
