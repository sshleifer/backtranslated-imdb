This is really a new low in entertainment. Although there are much worse movies out. <br /> <br /> In the Gangster / Drug scene genre, it's hard to have a compelling story (these movies don't mean I mean Sebastian's motifs, for example, couldn't be far-fetched and worn clich√©.) Then you would too Need a trustworthy sign setting. (This movie doesn't.) Secure Tristan is pulled away from his family, but why was it again? What about his father again, that he should ask for permission to go out in his age? interesting picture although asking about the lack and need for rebellious behavior of children in the upper class family. But this film does not go in this direction. Although there would be a potential assessment of the random backlinks. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /> <br /> So, there are some interesting questions raised here for a solid social criticism (but then again, this movie just isn't because you focus on "cool" production techniques and special effects that don't give a sign. moment to reflect and, most of all, force the story along the path where they want it and not pay attention to let the story breathe in and develop naturally.) <br /> <br /> It will be a drama for not glorify substance abuse and violence (would be politically incorrect these days, not?), but on the other hand, it's no more than a cheap action movie (as there are so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who does not completely destroy what is left of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> All in all, I just can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
