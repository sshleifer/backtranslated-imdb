How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still looked appropriate and attractive, but for some reason seems scary. I can understand her fears; fear that this 3rd rate stink would somehow be released to the public. I'm also a fan of the similar Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in good shape for a man, his age. His performance here is acceptable, but the manuscript is so bad that it is difficult to even listen to the dialog. <br /> <br /> The movie is a rip-off of the classic Brando biker flick, The Wild Ones; the out-law biker once is out of control in a small hick-town. The bikers here look like a modley group and I would definitely not have them to date my sister. The action is stiff and wood, and the story is as old as sand. Hellriders are hell to see!
