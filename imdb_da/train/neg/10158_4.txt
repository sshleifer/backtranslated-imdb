I couldn't help but think about behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon (a massive more amazing movie) when you look at this because of the realistic sense of it as well as the great innovative idea. This could have been a great movie. the actor is ... from some of the actors okay. from others ... it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> The page is great idea and the format is amazing. The story is also quite good, although it often suffers from big battles to the logical mind. <br /> <br /> Nevermind that though it's right? after all, it's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this remade ... I really want it to be the amazing movie it wants to be. <br /> <br /> (and you can't really spoil the minds of the movie for this) this is of course built on a shoe rigorous budget. and for example really hurt the movie together. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... if you were to replace some better actors and a little better eg. who wrote it should continue though, good idea here.
