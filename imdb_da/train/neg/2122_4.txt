Although Seven Pounds in some aspects is solid and interesting in part of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is pretty mediocre. The film is becoming more and more juicy and manipulative as it moves toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven pounds is more of an amateur imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores Perros and 21 grams, with lots of flashbacks. The problem is the story is pretty predictable from very easy through the movie. It's too bad because Seven Pounds could have been so authentic "good" if Ben and Emily were put in the right hands.
