'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a few Australian postal service employees struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the play is poor, and the links between the signs of the past and the present thoughts are lumpy and over-represented. What is most disappointing for all, however, is the portrayal of life on the movie title: There is no mechanization at all and it is quite impossible to determine what one of the staff really does to live. Permitted, part of the reason is that the office is threatened with closure, but this kind of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever really existed. It is a shame as the film's overall tone is sharp and angry, and there is some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels work for someone who has not experienced much of real life; a student film with a concept and a sketch, but unfortunately a little different.
