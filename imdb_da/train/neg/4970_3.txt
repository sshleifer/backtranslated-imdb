Good people, I stumbled upon this movie in the evening while I was graduating papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version coincides with the Christopher Lambert version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did I dislike? CGI for one. Incredibly bad. Even more important is the belief in the story, not to mention the stylish play. I'm used to both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Regardless of Peter's
