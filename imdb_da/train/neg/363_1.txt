What ends up killing this movie is, among other things, its self-awareness. Here's a short list: 1. Irreversible behavior. When beatles came over and injected their brand of "quirky, irreverent" behavior / humor, it was greeted as fresh. It was over 4 decades ago. Get over it. <br /> <br /> 2. Fake refinement. spewing out base, quasi-socio-political isms are hard reason to do work comically. ask woody allen. <br /> <br /> 3. The Postmodern "I have difficulty with this fake world and yes, I recognize it in myself" Snake eats itself - used as illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - is such a retread. <br /> <br /> 4. Smarmy, alley drollness. <br /> <br /> 5. amateur writing, action, direction ... ever seen student movies? A sacrifice for itself, the only thing I can say positive is that it at least has a sense of self, and sheesh, now I get caught in the self-reflective thing that it worth worth. br /> <br /> but against ... what? In the end, it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hi, ever see Woody Allen's take on Bergman, ie: "Interiors" ??? Well, it just makes it more amateurish.
