Lady in Cement - PI spoof with ole Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely fun "comedy". Pampered by an annoying and repetitive Hugo Montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this 1968 flick just never rises above a bit too bawdy to be on television made for television movie status. Dan Blocker is effective in Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia's great galoot role and Raquel Welch should thank his personal trainer. The only thing worth making or watching the DVD is the collection of cheesy trailers for Welch flicks like Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even though you get DVD leaps over the predictable movie and go to the trailer library in the special features.Besides tons of mysoginist asides- Sinatra lisps @ the gay owners of the local Go-Go bar. A relic to be put back in the time capsule. D
