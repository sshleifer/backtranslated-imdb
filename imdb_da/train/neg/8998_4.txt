Stephen Feinberg, who played the procologist and was one of the film's authors, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year later when he told me he had been a writer in Hollywood years earlier, working mostly on TV promos. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision' but it was too late I had seen it already! In fact, I had seen it the year before when it was released. At that time I didn't think it was such a bad movie. But seeing it as an adult was my opinion somewhat different. Yes, is a bit pueril as well as dated. Steve admitted that it was not a very good movie. That said, he was just a little proud of 'The Proctologist' sketch.
