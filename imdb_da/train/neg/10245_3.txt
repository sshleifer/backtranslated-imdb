I was expecting a lot from this movie. Like Lee as a Naustradamous character, but instead, everything I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can't even explain this movie. It had wood-like, horrible script from pieces from the Bible like hurricanes, tidal waves, and earthquakes. But it was in the end! The rest of it I had to wait and hope something meaningful would happen, but it didn't. This movie is about a couple trying to figure out the changes that are taking place in the world as places in China, where there was an earthquake and ending in a monastery run by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery is the key to misshappenings. The whole movie is misleading and boring. One of Lee's worst.
