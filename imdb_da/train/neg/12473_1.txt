This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, whether it is weak or incoherent. The action is absurd, the costumes are even curvaceous and the story is non-existent. This "poverty line" sword and adventure movie was supposed to capture some of the successes "Beastmaster" and "Conan" enjoyed, but it gives us no reason to keep up. The protagonist is lukewarm and boring, he can't even fight a sword, and the sword is from the 16th century. All the sequences of action are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music that plays when driving on a horse. Don't even bother with this crap.
