A craven, sweep movie. Director Boorman shows Cahill burglarizing rich houses, but the male resident has been shown to be unfaithful with a child's son, that's okay then. The forensic scientist examining Cahill is blown up in his car, but he's rats against sourpuss and doesn't look like a good man, so it's okay too. Beits, owner of Russborrough House, made their money by utilizing "darkies" digging diamonds, so it's okay to shout priceless art from them and store it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains. Garda kills his ferrets and is implicated in his murder. The moral equivalence is ill, Boorman is looking for a hit movie, but does not have the courage to oppose general gang crime, which terrorized the neighborhood and released another wave of scumbags in Dublin. He even contacted the grandson while he did. Disgusting. Shame on him for his cowardice.
