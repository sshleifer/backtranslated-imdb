American films about war and Nazis simply cannot be good. They cannot refrain from idiot and follow an agenda. All Nazis are bad, insane, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, yet so skilled and sensible and human. Come on, stop this villain. The protagonist says something like "by this experiment we must make aggressive war a crime". Is America a peaceful nation with the world's $ 1 billion "defense" budget (# 2 China with only $ 51b)? Is it simply used in this without any ... ROI? Why does America portray as a peaceful nation when it is not? I don't like movies with an agenda - they throw art into hell and try to persuade us to believe in something. Hollywood should label a film, as well as record labels have the "custody" label. We should have a "bullshit advisory", "propaganda advisory" or a "politically correct advisory" label on some movies. This is one of them.
