More of a mysterious movie with some gratuitous horror items thrown in; Mediocre parent. It starts with a woman who has a nightmare where her sex partner goes out of bed, goes into her greedy child's room and kills it. She wakes up. Then the man dies in a hospital and spits blood up. His alien daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through his dreams (I believe), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body completely breaks down in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not too much mystery about who did it or even how; Most viewers will have figured it out long before it is revealed. I'm not sure the way he was killed would have really worked. <br /> <br /> Whatever happens, the horror elements come through: a gory autopsy, the recurring dream of the man killing the boy, a nightmare a plate of egg turns into eyes, which are then cut, and several shots of the destructive man both in nightmare and actually in his grave. I was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end of Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.
