I want to preface this by saying that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man shows up some of the funniest action clich√©s that are conceivable, and detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler *, although there is nothing like a Dolph spoiler, as scripts are so absurd at first: a hunting scene with a disabled child wearing a gun versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hall and the child wins? Good game, Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for the laughter, old friend. Summary: Great movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends to this and forcing them to sit through it. Hysterical fun.
