Hoo boy, this was a real try to get through. The DVD cabinet has Tom Hanks mug plastered on it and that is the only reason anyone would buy it. He looks about forty on the box, but the film was made in 1982, so he still has his Bosom Buddies' do and of course is about forty pounds lighter. The reason is about a Dungeons and Dragons as a game played by Hanks and his three friends, and Hanks believe that the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a genius named Jay Jay, and the best thing about the movie is that he has a lot of fun hats. Ooh, see, he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo! Now he is dressed as a WWI pilot! This was a really horrible movie, but in a bad way. A bunch of veterinarians appear mainly as parents of the children. There is Anne (I'm Honey West, dusty!) Francis and Louise Sorel who actually look a little hot. Jaws Mayor Murray Hamilton has a ransom roll as a policeman. Wendy Crewson, is the love interest for Hanks and a blonde guy I've never seen before or since. There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no excitement or sense of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he is, you know, nuts. The monster is played by the late, big Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator fame. One of my friends got this out of the ol 'discount box at MallWart and advised me to throw it in the bin without looking at it, so of course I had to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before, I saw Apollo 13, so after this movie was a bit of a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the box. Oh yes, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recover and be visited by his friends. Hank's mother, a drunk Vera Miles, says he is getting along well now, but when they go down to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he is brighter than ever. The end
