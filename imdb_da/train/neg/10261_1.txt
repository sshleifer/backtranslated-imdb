Wow, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the "scary" movies they show around Halloween. Was this rated G? There was nothing to make this movie scary or worth seeing. Others also say this is a spoof, but I don't think so. For a spoof, you need something called "humor". This low-budget crap party did not have a shrink of humor, nor did it make much sense. You have pretty much a giant looking monster (man in rubber boots) coming out of the closet and killing people, I think, since you never see the monster make violence to any or any bloody recess. The exciting newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so it goes well enough. <br /> <br /> The military mistakenly tries to kill the monster, which is not much larger than a man. They have very poor goals. So the military abounds! Wow, did this movie make the American military look pathetic or what? The monster, while it is difficult to kill, does not matter much to mix around and roar. Oh, and sometimes another head jumps out of his mouth and screams. It was a little interesting, but alien Ripoff. <br /> <br /> What was it about the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster? It was hard to understand much of the dialogue because of the poor sound quality. Also, why has the monster worn around the biggest wimpy guy for so long? Why didn't the monster go into the closet as it had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense of the meaningless?
