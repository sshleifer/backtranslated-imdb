Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this turkey from 1970, but the manuscript is so paralyzing and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar winner) can't start pulling this out of the mud . As a skirt hunting fever in its 40s, salespeople scare themselves to the nth degree. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10 Best Performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young study type. I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well because I didn't see any other reason to look like this in 1970 (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others). You can't win them all!
