As far as HEIST film goes, this one is pretty weak. Continuity is rather miserable, there is not enough character continuity to really feel that you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is fantastic and he is one of the reasons why it is worth seeing. Falk has some good lines, like "he will be right back, he has to buy some saugages" or something ... there are some good scenes, even though they are entirely due to the players' efforts. Direction, script and editing are pretty miserable.
