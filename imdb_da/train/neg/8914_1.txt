I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious movie viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawns, not to mention I was soon close on tears over $ 3.99 I had wasted in Blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's play and her terribly restored Slavic accent are sufficiently horrifying to set one to grill one's teeth. I knew two hours of her would be two hours for many. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of striking few talents. While on the subject of talent, Breuer's supercilious assistant seems to have been pulled out of a locally functioning troupe. She obviously hasn't learned her craft. In fact, she is really awful. All the public scenes looked on stage, with extras going mechanically on their Sunday best. Quitting this movie was far more satisfying than turning it on. Don't rent this horrible movie. You will be sorry you spent your money.
