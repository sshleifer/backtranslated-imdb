This may be crazy for even the people who remember this show ... But I remembered this as a live action. I don't think I've ever seen the comic. but movie? maybe. I remember it very clearly. The guy was in a building like a showroom. He even had the red jacket. It was dark and he turned into a red car, and there was this second-level guy looking down at him. The car / guy ran around and crashed through the window with a large showroom type and out onto the street. And then continued driving. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else out there remembers this too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I'm not.
