European Vacation (aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of the holiday films (the first and the third the most superior of the films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new players in the role of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they get a weaker script with very poor dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny. To be more specific, what really causes this movie to suffer, is the fact that the "jokes" as they are are only glued together in a cobbled script) instead of earning a central plot that the other 3 holiday movies have . Oh yes, they can't win them all. 4 out of 10
