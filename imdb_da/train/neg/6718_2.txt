I wanted to watch the movie because of an article in a movie magazine. It was not a highly recommended critic. The story is different and I'm sure it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. The management and action was horrible !! I had the feeling of watching a movie made a lot of amateurs. Although the film started promising, it got worse and worse. I think it's an unoriginal movie with awkward characters. I still think it's worth seeing as I haven't seen movies that expose gay porn. Do not keep your expectations high, however, and you will be very disappointed. * out of *****
