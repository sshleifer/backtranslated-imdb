As soon as I started seeing posters and hearing about this movie, I was immediately excited. The matrix was amazing to see and I couldn't wait to see the other, especially after I started watching the trailers on it on other movies. But when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, just like many other movie shows at the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always, there were simply too few of them. In the first movie, there was constant fighting, it seemed, but the other took a much more (and very unfortunate) predictive point of view. To summarize the plot, there was little to what was not expected. The machines dug against Zion with the purpose of destroying it (it's not a spoiler, everyone saw it in the advertisements). The film's dialogue was absolutely horrible. Unless you are a major psychology, you will most likely not understand most of what is said in the movie, and because of that, it just doesn't care. It became something of a romantic movie with shows of events happening in Neo and Trinity's life and relationship. Agent Smith, for as bad as he was in the first movie, seemed to be all religious and preaching. Personally, I don't have to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of my time, and I don't think I can see the first one any more. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from virtually every character made me quickly lose interest in the movie, and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the movie pushed me straight out. Which movie ends with "To be completed"? How original they are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers were going to burn the midnight oil to come up with one. In conclusion, the film was bad and that is the end of it.
