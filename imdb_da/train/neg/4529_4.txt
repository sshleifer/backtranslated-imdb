I will not describe the story as it has been done elsewhere. We are good Clive Owen fans and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were fascinated. <br /> <br /> No wonder we had never heard of this "movie" because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992. Therefore, the poor production values, grainy image, crooked camera work and poor sound. <br /> <br /> But you don't mind the mechanics because the story itself puts you in bed. It is an interesting human story, but not at all convincing, and there is hardly any end. You don't care about the characters as their life is as boring as your life looks at this boring movie. Save the two hours and do something to make time worthwhile.
