The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the theater, it would be far exceeded. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also encountered, but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or the other young punk, this will be a "sweet" movie for you. Personally, I will wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
