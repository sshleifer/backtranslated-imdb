As other reviewers have noticed, the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. But before it suffers from predictability and an amazing vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and destroys every scene she is in. Connery is fine as it is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated to effect rather than Truth that overlays the whole with a sense of unreality. And the end is simply bizarre. The filmmakers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed was sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overflow "dramatic" score. Each little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of big league bad movies this is one to see, or it will skip.
