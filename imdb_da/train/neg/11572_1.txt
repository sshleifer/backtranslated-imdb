Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat several McDonalds while filming itself and stop producing. There is no way you can look at this and enjoy. The priest is a joke. The whole idea is not fun. You can make a 2 minute movie with this idea not a feature. I'm so sorry to rent this movie. I will never see anything called Spurlock on it. It's completely rubbish. Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never get a distribution agreement. The film says US consumers and their shopping are guilty of the current depression when they shop and buy products, making money circulating in the system is the foundation of a healthy economy.
