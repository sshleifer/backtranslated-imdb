I want to be short ... This movie is an embarrassment to everyone except its film photographer. The fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems to be valid until we are "treated" to a lingering dance scene. The reason is ridiculous no one, except the most ardent fan of BAD horror will get something out of it. And for God's love, just stop saying that this movie is a story of innocence that has been lost or even of female empowerment because it is clearly not (childishly fumbling lesbians, what the hell?). This was by far the worst movie at the Edinburgh Festival (which I saw anyway), some fell halfway through the movie probably because they couldn't take more of it. This may seem too critical, but I really can't find a redeeming feature of this movie except maybe if you take it as pure comedy. In short, this film is best seen on a cocktail of class A substances.
