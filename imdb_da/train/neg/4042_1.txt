This movie is beautiful to watch, but is like seeing really poor experimental theater. The reason (if there was one) makes no sense. But it is very "artistic". Lots of shots of half-dressed actors break in and look deep into each other's eyes. Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of the frame. Mumbling and people wistfully wander. Long close-ups of faces and bodies. When you get to the triangle on the roof with the cat, you will be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. It must be about a father and son's relationship, but you just want the two of them to just f * $ & each other and get it over with. If you've always wanted to see poor Russian gay porn without money shot, your desire has been given.
