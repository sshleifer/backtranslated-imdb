Oh, it's the movie - I thought I was waiting too long to take the dog out ... I can't believe I saw it all. I suppose I was optimistic that it would get better. Horribly disjointed dialogue, pathetic action and totally unlikely events. As Toby's mother hangs herself in time, it takes the Col to go upstairs and down into a room with a 24 'ceiling and no chairs, counters, or anything around her motionless suspended body that she might have used to climb to make themselves in The little girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the first couple's puppy was a close second. The basic story has potential and with a good script and instructor can be a seriously scary flick, but this version is unfortunately not it. I get more afraid when I open my electricity bill every month.
