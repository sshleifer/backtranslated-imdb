This movie is horrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you plan to see it, it is enough to say - not (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie). The action is horrible ... seriously amateur hour. Throughout the film I thought it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and resembles Michael Madsen, to find out only that it is actually him! A new coat even for him !! <br /> <br /> The reason is horrible. People who claim to be original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it !!! Go to a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.
