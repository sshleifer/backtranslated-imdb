Well, it's a typical "straight to the toilet" slasher movie. Long story short, a bunch of teenagers / young adults being stranded in the midst of creepy forests and being hacked by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basics of this slasher fraaga: - Non-women, lighters or young adults are marooned in some spooky, gory death scenes, the last survivor is a well-built young woman who will always show her midriff, but never bra less, a scary, crazy man who knows about the evil, lesbian kiss scene, sex is killer, no plot <br /> <br /> Even for a cheesy slasher movie it was really terrible. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested. Seeing it felt like it was being watched with an unpleasant headache or an uncomfortable head cold. <br /> <br /> Give the demonic ..... 0/10.
