How wonderful. Another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably half a dozen times, one day a piece, and thinks to be an "expert" in the country. Sheesh. I had to take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as "Nazi country" or some of them. Wim IL boy, you should come with Lars von Trier and make the ultimate film about the Americans. Of course, we all know that it takes a pretentious leftist "we are the world" Europeans to make a "real" movie about America. Yes right. For a continent that did not start one, but two world wars, Europe certainly has many opinions on America's wrong "foreign policy". <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't worry, Wim IL boy, there are lots of UC-Berkeley Americans who will just love your movie. It is, of course, the same people who believe that George W. Bush is worse than Hitler and that a painting of a can of mushrooms is "pure genius" !!
