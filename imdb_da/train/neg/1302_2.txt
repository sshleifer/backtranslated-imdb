This movie is like any other Dutch movie, so if you enjoy movies like turmeric fruit and the little blondes die. then you can be okay with this one (even if the two have much better stories and actors) Summer heat starts well enough, but even one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the story. There is a lot of nudity (but I and others just couldn't find the girl attractive), the dialogue is ridiculous (as we did a lot for the annoyance of other movie watchers), and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else (like a random scene where an owl rips a person's eye out ... it has nothing to do with anything and is only referred once later in a sentence that says "did you hear what happened ... I was there "). the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are on look good ... that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in the Netherlands we have a strange system with sneak previews, you pay less money then for a regular movie, and you don't know what movie you want Be all you know is that it is a new movie that is not yet in the theaters). My advice is to stay far away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch movie from temmink or zwartboek.
