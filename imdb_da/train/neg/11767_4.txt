I had little hope for this, because I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back, so I figured this would have more of a blow to it. First, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looks as if his eyebrows were transformed into this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as you might expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama case didn't really stick to the original story line I don't believe. I suppose the best part of the movie was the end. It had some cool actions. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This is not so long, but it was a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale, and I always wondered why? Now I know. I was hoping to be blown away, but I wasn't.
