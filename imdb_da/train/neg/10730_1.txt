Movies start with 3 people who meet each other at the bar. OKAY. They talk about their imaginary life, lying all the time, for no reason. Still OK. From time to time, they make you laugh. Interesting. In the first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it! But then things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then when something happens, you can just see that naked old "ladies" touch each other! Not okay. Disgusting! That way, this part should be the top of the movie, but that's all but it! Movies have no meaning, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is here (Belgrade, Serbia) at the FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to research, of course before people saw it! I even thought (before you saw): "Hey, it may be interesting, even if it's a Russian movie"! But God, no !!!!
