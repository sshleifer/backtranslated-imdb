This is a horrible movie. All three stories are seized by a psychiatrist hypnotist line, which is unnecessary, and all stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and some ladies, there are some things that do not make sense, but the things of hypnotism make it. The other, with poor Bill Paxton as a madman, should not be seen by anyone. The latter, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which I think does better than the other waste.
