I chose this film on the cover alone and thought that I was in for an adventure to the "Indiana Jones and Doom Temple" level. Unfortunately, I was in favor of a virtual yawn. Not like any gab I've had before. This spawn was so large that I could hardly find any quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The film was so easy that even the stereotypes were terribly portrayed. It gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids it. I dont do that. Stay away from this one. If you're looking for family entertainment, you'll find something more inspiring elsewhere.
