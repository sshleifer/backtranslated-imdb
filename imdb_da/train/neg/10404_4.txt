This, the Tremors series direct-to-video death, contains sixty inspired seconds (saw blade: you know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick on. Of course, Tremors 4 was shot on an amazingly low budget. This means that they only had enough special effects for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, peaks. The missing, clich√©-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensures that the remaining one and a half hours of the Tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long. Only hardcore Tremors fans will be able to sit through, much less enjoy this movie. If you're not among them - don't bother.
