Snow White is, in my opinion, a poor film at an artistic point of view. The reason is pretty much predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing is too exaggerated. Nevertheless, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think it's a just commercial thing. Including a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band is called SENS UNIK) seems to be aimed at a larger audience. An even German-Swiss movie would not have sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really was on my nerves was the product placements throughout the film. Sometine's scenes were remembered by commercials! <br /> <br /> I am also thinking of the subject "young people taking drugs without other goals in their lives" is a wide spread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated more carefully. I hope Samir has got enough money with Snow White for his next movie to show his true artistic skills.
