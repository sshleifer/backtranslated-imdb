It's pretty simple. Friends are a comedy of very basic humor aimed at teenagers and young adults with unsophisticated sense of humor. It is also painfully obvious that they are ultimately trying desperately to make the last 10 seasons, most likely to say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The problem with this is that Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, friends had (and I'm very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 creepy seasons. <br /> <br /> It was a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled traits that were not so good, so begin with and then worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly. It is really terrible.
