I literally fell 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare, and it takes some thinking to be interested or not. But this film exceeds any barrier to long soliloquies, and what doesn't, it can prevent many from just worrying about a Shakespeare-based story. The greatest roadblock for this production is the complete flatness of the sign. Often during the character's interaction, it is almost difficult to distinguish who lines are, who is. Granted, I think this movie is duplicated in English. They could certainly have achieved voters who could have added a little more drama to these classic literary lines. It would be difficult to judge this movie more than 1, although it may be based on prejudices of perhaps age and what seems to be a very low budget. Yet it is absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1.10
