I saw the Canadian video tape of this movie as "The Witching" which somehow made its way to New York State. The sound was pretty bad, I had to raise it to about 7/8 to hear it, and the soundtrack was often overwhelming the dialogue. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialogue and others were driven through an echo chamber. A ghost figure holding back had her voice distorted. A series of witches or satanists (the final credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group!) Have a ritual where they get stuck and cause an abortion by sticking a doll. The woman who had abortion and her husband moved to a city called "Lilith", where he was offered a job at a toy factory. Although one of the AKAs in this movie seems to be "The Toy Factory", we never see it, and it is only referred to occasionally. <br /> <br /> On her way to Lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion. He runs aggressively and causes another car to get out of the way and blow up. After the police arrive, she takes a doll that fell out of the car, the other of many handmade dolls in the movie. It turns out that Mr Cato and all the cities are witches and that they are the ones who caused her abortion even though she did not understand it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy that she wasn't really aware of. <br /> <br /> Some pictures in the movie have some influence, but generally the movie is not very involved. The movie seems a bit messy and it is undoubtedly largely due to its editing and the addition of new footage. The original version, according to the final credit, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The DVD's magic may let us see both versions on a disc, but republishing this movie is probably not a priority.
