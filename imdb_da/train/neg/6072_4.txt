DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies {not in baseball so much, but hey, its sports movie, right?. I was expecting much more for this movie. It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {which I don't really like} is very good as the spoiled star. Barkin's role for me was ok. She is a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. For me, they always seemed to hurry the scenes, and then it pulls a little in places. It just seemed to me to be so uneven! Considering the cast and plot it could have been so much better. I rated it a '4' and I was generous ~ I'm a tough one with numbers!
