This film is told through a young teacher at a Catholic school and looks like the RAWANDAN genocide that is un-furls around him. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a brief explanation of the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic "NEW-COMER" a young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road block, he plays around with his drivers I.D. not to realize that this is a serious moment, and that if the driver cannot identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers, they will be killed. And that's how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolds around him. Suddenly realize that all Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that Europeans cannot and will not help soldiers and tourists. The media cameras can't stop the machete's and for many machete-wielding militia men are also shooting. The title comes from the Army Captain, who says he has to shoot the dogs who eat the dead bodies around his composition, but will not shoot the militants who kill people around the connection. Mainly because they haven't fired to the soldiers yet. Finally, he understands the hopes of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he will give his seat to one of the intended victims flies with his tail between his legs instead of looking at immanent death with the schoolchildren He is promised not to leave. <br /> <br /> It's more character study, and one comes to Jesus moment for a sign than a story about the genocide in "RAWANDA". This movie should not take place in RAWANDA, it could have taken place one of the genocide hell holes going around the world at any time.
