I'm very tolerant of really bad sci / fi and horror movies - I've seen them since I was 4 or 5, so I've seen some really bad things, but I treat it. I've even seen many SciFi Channel movies, so I don't know much to expect - a normally promising movie that has no end to talk about. Hope runs forever, I think - or the bounce's victory over experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog right from the start, and I knew it, but as a mill to the flame, I thought of something, something that would happen interestingly. It doesn't. All the actors give a decent performance - given the script, I don't know how they all held straight faces. It has something to do with collagen hairy worm parasitic creatures that slowly take over humanity, one body at a time. There is a vicious plastic surgeon who works with the enemy by giving them the outer appearance of man ... calmly, he gets what comes to him. The sly people themselves don't really know where they came from, they think they could have a thumb ride on a meteor that landed on the ground, but ... somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - slug princess has managed to breed with a man who knows that she is the worm queen and loves herself. Oh, should I continue? Please, I ask you, don't waste 2 hours in your life looking at this ... something would be better ... think in the worst, least pleasant way you can spend two hours on ... it would be better than this.
