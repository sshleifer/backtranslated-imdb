Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story with a ending that leaves you wondering how to puzzle out what really happened when it was done on purpose ... But this movie really feels that they got everyone but the last 15 minutes finished, they realized they had $ 5 back to the end of ... <br /> <br /> I saw it at TBS ... I recommend you not spend money on it either. If you catch it on TV, watch anything other than the last 15 minutes, then go away and put your own end in your mind. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie would have been better if they just got away and came back with the Births of the State's State to find out that the city and car cemetery were gone, and of all appearances was never there. "I wish I had more thumbs so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down!"
