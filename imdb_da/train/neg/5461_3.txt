Like all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they rate virtually every episode as they are the biggest shows ever. While several of them are wonderful classics, the truth of every major episode is that there were several who were mediocre and at least one who stank. However, these Zone lovers, like de-hard Trekkies, insist that everyone is gold. In fact, this is what originally made me review some individual episodes of a few cult series instead of the movies I normally see. <br /> <br /> Though this is not the worst episode ever made or it is among the very worst, it is poor of any reasonable standard. Widow sees a long procession of civil war soldiers passing by her home. Eventually, a very unexpected twist is revealed and there is not a lot of excitement or tension here.
