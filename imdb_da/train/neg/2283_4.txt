And Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be highlighted with the same awe as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this a little more than a little disturbed, a lovable but creepy behavior that led to you hoping for a greater role throughout the film. The second reason is M. Eburne's comic relief. Being in the medical profession itself, I have to give kudos to expert performance of a self-propelled hypochondriac. Although other "medical flaws" gave a brief chuckle, especially when the good doctor is trying his medication medicine ... "Continue giving it to her" Unfortunately, these 2 excellent performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts to sit through this unbearably slow movie. The reason is predictable with only a few minor terms. The movie while drawing a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive to make me yawn - yes you can use too much shade. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - see this time to see Frye and Eburne - but only when it is completely awake and with lots of caffeine.
