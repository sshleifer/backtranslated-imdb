This movie is a bad, okay rip off Friday the 13th. The film is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp. He kills people because the train's training camp is on land owned by his father, and when the police came to force his father's land to the ground, he killed an accident at his mother (another F13th start). Intro sees Bernie killing his first victims. Then we are introduced to a family that goes in the same forest, soon after they arrive, they are put together by a strange old man who likes to talk about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has unlocked him in his caravan after he has broken him out of a mental institution. He sets Bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then chase. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for those who enjoy B grade 80's Slashers.
