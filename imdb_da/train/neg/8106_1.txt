Seriously, why do American and French actors pretending to be Czechs have to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I am a man so I enjoyed the exact nudity - but a soft pornstick would have more of it and at least not pretend it was artistic. <br /> <br /> All the political statements that painfully didactically- have the director heard of subtlety? The actor was also woody and melodramatic, and comic relief was never fun. The characters were very shallow and I just couldn't identify with them. <br /> <br /> The bit I was laughing at was when they cut the actors into archive films of the Prague demonstrations - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footage - just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I read many of Customer's short stories (not the unbearable ease of being), and there are good things about his style of writing (though his themes are a great male imagination) - and I have to say that the film did not convey anything of customer's style.
