I can clearly see now why Robin Hood flopped fast. The first episode of that is probably the worst ever the BBC has broadcast. The opening scenes were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys struggling, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people had eyeliner in the 12th century? None. The series may have improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly puts people's hopes down and is essentially a pile of cr * p. Great luck in England has been outraged. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to tolerate this?" I don't want to, that's for sure, unless the BBC starts to understand what's a clever investment. 3.10
