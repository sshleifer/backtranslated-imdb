This movie looked as though it could be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian instructors), but does not know how to create or tell a good story to follow. The story was fragmented and seemed to go in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, without finding a solid, explanatory, interesting angle. Basically, the film never fits into the explanation of the press releases. However, the action was very good. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was excellent as he always is. It's too bad that he chose to make such a weak film.
