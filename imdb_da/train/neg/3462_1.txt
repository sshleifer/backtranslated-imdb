Slash flicks come few and far between now a day, so when I heard about Cut I had great hopes and heard good things about it. The good things I heard were all wrong .. very wrong! This flick is bad and I mean bad. It's just plain stupid. Everything about it. Especially the killer is the origin and how he lives and how he is taken care of in the end. There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. Just another slasher wannabe with them "Hip", "Self aware." "Movie savvy" characters. I'm so sick of that shit. Someone does something else because slash genre needs new blood, literally.
