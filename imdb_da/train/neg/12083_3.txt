Yay! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have a feeling of a movie that has no feeling. This film is as sterile as the surgeon's scalpel. For a setting it has a few stone pillars, some stone seats, a few stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no feelings! The only thing that saves this movie is that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a wonderful piece of literature. The duplication was really not that bad. The voices were right against the dull, gloomy, sad, life-inspiring atmosphere that the film gave. I've seen this version of Hamlet at the amazing Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times I was on the verge of turning off the TV, even though it was MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
