I go to UCSB and take some classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She is a wonderful teacher and instructor so something she makes her name I thought to be pretty good. This movie as a selection at the Santa Barbara Film Festival seemed like a good choice. While this movie included some fine shots and movies, the lack of history and context really took away from anything it was trying to achieve. My main problem was that this was someone's first movie, and of course you could tell. Poor acting and an even worse manuscript stopped this movie from getting out of the ground. The soundtrack had a lovely music that gave the feelings of the protagonists the battle to cope with the sadness that led to his leaving and now returning to the place he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the film's better craftsmanship, the lack of history and performance really prevented it from being good.
