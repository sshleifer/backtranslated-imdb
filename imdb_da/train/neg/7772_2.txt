This is a low film. It has no real plot. We are never made into motives other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors ever put on film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three older people. Why are they doing what they do to turn fear to other members of the group? I do not know. There is some fog from a fog machine that rolls around the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it. Does it matter? I do not know. There is some nudity for his own sake. I am always surprised to see this in movies this old one. Things have actually settled in this regard these days. Still, the people run around like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plans; no resources No nothing. There are about five stupid climaxes in the movie. Who are these people and "is" there a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I challenge someone to tell me this with confidence. What a mess.
