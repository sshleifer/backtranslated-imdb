Antonioni's film has not lived well. What always surprised me about them is that besides undoubtedly plastic beauty is a dull and didactic "psychology" of the characters and situations. For example, remember the conversations between Mastroianni and the "evil capitalist" who want to sing him in "La Notte" or Monica Vitti laugh at the peasants who flirt in the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti loses the glass with ink at the end. The same movie. <br /> <br /> I reviewed yesterday "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are many beautiful and detailed pictures of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of LA, the advertising ads, the deserts, etc., showing the writer's fascination with his American journey in the same way as Wim Wender's years later. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-left clich√©s that destroy the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals a plane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something else". - Leaders in gray suites are constantly talking about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the swimming pool and leaves because she doesn't want to be like them. - The middle-class couple in the caravan speak in front of nature's beauty about building a hotel and making a lot of money. - Last but not least, a lot of couples who love the desert. What a hippie river! <br /> <br /> Sorry, for half a century after the "Revolution" of "La Aventura" we can see that the king is naked and his film (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il Grido") is only one handful of aesthetics and common spaces.
