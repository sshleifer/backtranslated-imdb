I can't believe I'm wasting my time watching this waste! I did, because Leonard Maltin gave it an AA rating, and for television movies this is usually a reliable indicator of good quality entertainment. The action was okay, but the one who wrote it should be denied access to any communication medium forever. The reason is ridiculous, the motivation of the "evil" is completely absent, and the various family interactions are stupid and superficial. For example, Dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is bad, but he turns out to be an "admirable" person, NOT because of his "ignoring the idiots" philosophy, but because he is pretty good with his fists ... < The only message I was able to collect from this card was that the nuclear family is good and alternative living arrangements are poor. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
