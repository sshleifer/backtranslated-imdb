This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolutely worst movie Steven Seagal has ever made. And that says a lot. Don't be fooled by the judgment, it's too good. This abomination had not even been worthy of a 0/10 rating if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - Worst scenes ever and there aren't too many of them <br /> <br /> - Seagal doesn't do it yourself including fighting, talking (lots of duplicates) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and could not care less about this movie. Something that is very obvious all the way through <br /> <br /> Take all the other trash games DTV movies Seagal has made, multiply them with one another, multiply this by a thousand billion and all the evil you get so wont describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
