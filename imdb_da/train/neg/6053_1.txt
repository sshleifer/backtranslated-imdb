absolute trash can. I liked Halloween and since then, Johnny has been in a downward spiral. It's about the mines. we got it john. Pro-lifers are scary! You don't have to make a shitty movie that drills hell out of me to 'tell' me. <br /> <br /> The pacing is far away. It feels like John didn't have much to work with here. to his credit it seems he did not write this junk. There are countless times when the camera is waiting for the actors to look stupid or say something stupid. I love the long piece. Too bad carpenter does not know how to use it. he must pile up with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please John, stop making yourself fooled and saddened me to death!
