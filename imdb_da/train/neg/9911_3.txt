If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Coolio or any other distractions. Massive talent is completely wasted in "Three Days to Vegas", with the blame falling entirely on the script. My neighbor's holiday movie is as interesting as this misleading road movie. To see how to use a veteran cast with a good script, check out "Crew". There are really no redeeming factors here, and seeing these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I would like it, but the low script cheats the audience by giving the players essentially nothing to work with. - NOTE
