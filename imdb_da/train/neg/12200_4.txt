Normally, any movie with Sylvester Stallone will usually suck ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only films that Sylvester Stallone was in were good were Rocky and First Blood. This movie is extremely unrealistic and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I didn't like to see it and I would never see it again. No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for worst picture. I would give this a 3/10, the only reason it got 3 was because it had some good action but not good enough.
