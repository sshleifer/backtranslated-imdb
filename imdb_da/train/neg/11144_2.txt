This flick reminded me of the bad "erotic thrillers". I used to stay up late and watch Cinemax when I was 13. I wanted to feel this flickering softer core, as there is no simulated bump and grinder. There is, however, a ton of nudity - the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder's chests (or at least a stunt stump) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the movie and a nude female werewolf that looks like that they curled up at Munster's for a costume. 13 year old boys are looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen this year. The shoots resemble FMVs from video games Resident Evil in terms of quality. The wolf is too poor to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the suit, appears too many times. <br /> <br /> The reason and the play makes no sense. There is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - Darkwolf is the latter, but from what I can tell hybrids do the same, all werewolves look human, switch to a wolf that kills people. The Darkwolf tries to find a friend, but cannot find the man, but can sniff out who she touches. Once again, these skills show less than helpful, as Darkwolf wins killing more people who his goals never touched, met or even saw as well as I can tell. The couple does not know that she is a werewolf, and she is fighting the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You'd think it would be hard to destroy a simple monster movie's bad like this, but well they did. Wish quality low-end werewolf-ism, go hire Dog soldiers will have a ton of T&A this is your flick.
