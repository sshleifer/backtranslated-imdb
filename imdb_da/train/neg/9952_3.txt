Just sent a friend who is in film school about this flick. Something to avoid when making a movie - sign blabbering meaningless, overwhelmed, envelope monologues on the screen that are ultimately trite and convincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as a film and effectively neutralize that intention. Is it the play or the script that is bad, or both? The protagonist is also very incredible for social realism - genuinely consuming canonical English literature and the Bible while it is high or hungover and can produce such deeply sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, greasy, and verbally harmful character able to sleep most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (I had to pat when a chick finally threw him out into the street, despite his whining and of course shame). Viewer meets pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and Revelation Book. The imminent judgment of mankind, in the form of barcodes printed on our forehead or right hands in eerie biblical fashion, is presented to a sign so horribly exposed to his role as guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This flip is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama lump infused with pedestrian philosophy about the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It is thin, flooded and dull. <br /> <br /> There are some very fine English movies available with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion in the lives of individuals in a similar social environment. Dito for "In the Warzone." And even though the comparison is not even justified, check out some of Peter Greenaway who handles much more dialogue, whites and absurd characters and situations.
