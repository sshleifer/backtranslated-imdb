I grew up in Scooby Doo Where are you and I still love it. It's one of my favorite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. However, this show is good for kids, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme is acceptable and it has a good animation. But it's pretty disappointing. I usually don't mind Scrappy, but when he seems to be like the protagonist it gets annoyingly fast. Complete with catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than normal. Also half of the band is missing after the first year, somehow it doesn't want Scooby Doo. And the jokes and lines of history were generally lame and unoriginal, very little hunting monsters or masking evil. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a little, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, the voices, the theme and the fact that it is great for children. Bethany Cox
