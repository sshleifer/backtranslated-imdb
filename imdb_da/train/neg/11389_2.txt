If you like movies hit with little plot exposure seasoned with kinky sex, this movie is for you. On the plus side, leading actress / actress (new transsexuals) has an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add much more than a mildly interesting movie - if so. In essence, this film is about 3 social broadcasts (transsexual prostitutes, male hustlers and Russian gay immigrants) who have somehow developed a bond. Why is it not clear. We are expected to accept these misfits are the basic basic honest people who have the ability to love while penetrating their bodies on the streets. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her ninety-something sugar daddy! The filmmaker shows a greedy, unpleasant side of life, while we want us to believe it, all these seriously injured people are really quite normal to the extent that they have a menage of faith that helps them through life. Totally fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as a true look of life on the wild side. Together, no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend much time here. Unless you just like to be saved in kink !!!
