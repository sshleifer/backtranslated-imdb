St. Elmo's Fire has no meaning for life after university at all (for most of us ordinary folk anyway). Why was this garbage itself made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors handling such a terrible script. There are some talented young players in this "movie" who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been quite a joke for them on the set. In fact, I found this "movie" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I got from this, is that Sir John Hughes was happy to laugh when he saw a screening this same year, his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made to see this because you're enjoying the 80s movie. It's really that offensive to the genre.
