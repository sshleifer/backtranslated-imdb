Here, let me bend my hands over the keyboard, I'll tell you which salad to order. Time and again it works like a charm: he is such a genius, how does he do it? my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i scan channels i need to be very careful (these days it is useful too often so i dont have to be broken on idiotic crap like this ... cautious with the remote !). should this be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible area of ​​uberman control and mastery? or what? Why does it exist? <br /> <br /> This is the most inane show, absolutely incredible and constructed, and I can't understand why it's still in the air. so geeks can give so much better shows such a hard time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give this nonsense drive a pass. shows that Firefly (if any) falls off after a season, but thoughtless things like this, giving zero logical feeling, just keep on marching. yeccch.
