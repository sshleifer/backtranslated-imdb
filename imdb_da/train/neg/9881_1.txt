Bo Derek's debut film remained invisible for eight years ?? And that was how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as an instructor, he is largely Ed Wood of erotic cinema ?? not that this is particularly explicit, since Bo (atypically sporting dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! John also wrote and photographed it; the latter results in a decent recording of the Greek island setting against which the story is set ?? but plotting is pueril and the dialogue terrible! <br /> <br /> The character of male leaders Peter Hooten has been brought up with the Bos family: they grew up as brother and sister, but in their teens, the couple discover they are attracted to each other (but, as I said, don't expect some sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst thing about this is that the protagonists each have an obsession with the entire movie, which is not only stupid in itself but annoying in their relentlessness? Hooten wants to turn the distant fishing into a modernized resort on the sea side and still expects a cruise ship to become a display (which of course does so at the final); Derek is yet nuttier ?? she requires possession of a large antique hot tub !! To the plate, the couple is married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Also involved in the non-events is the mayor and a photographer lothario, who wants to make a model out of Bo (and of course there is anger of the jealous Hooten). For a very good reason, we are even treated with excerpts from screening of old Hollywood classics in an open-air film house that the whole city gathers (among the titles is the PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bo's naive whole is unimaginably charming, it is not enough to compensate for the movie's overwhelming lethargy and amateurity.
