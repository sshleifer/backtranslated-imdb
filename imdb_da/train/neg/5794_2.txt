The Germans stand out in the open and are knocked down by a machine gun. the good guys never die unless it is for dramatic purposes. The "plot" has so many holes, it's ridiculous. (Where did the German soldiers go when they rolled the fuel tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijack a train? How moronic it is! The Germans KNOW where you are going, it's not like you can leave the track and drive away! What a waste. I'd rather bonk myself upside down with a pen hammer 10 times so I have to sit through it again. I seriously think it was like it was made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! The A Team is more credible than this horrible excuse for a movie. Just look at it if you need a good laugh. This movie is for Tele Sevalas, what Green Beret was to John Wayne.
