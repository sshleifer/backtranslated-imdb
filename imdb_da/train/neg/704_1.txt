A slim romanticization of the sexual exploitation of New Orleans black women by white men with power and privilege. Ooh. Does it make your appetite? Now see the stomach up to a VHS or DVD and divide this free trolling through a seamy segment of the story. For good measure, it is adapted from the book by famous hack Anne Rice. The director is as cloying and melodramatic as the osteic dialogue. Most of the plays are amateurish. The only valuable comment of the production is that it has almost been a dozen black actors, all of whom have not been employed in today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that have hardly been seen ( Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It is also in spite of itself a strong showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and thought-provoking James Earl Jones is also present. Then it's late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent who owes his success to being affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be judged "T" for tripe.
