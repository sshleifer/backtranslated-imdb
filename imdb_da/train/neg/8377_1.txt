That is precisely why many people remain homeless. . . Because stupid producers pay their money to make horrible movies like this instead of donating if they can interfere! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white chickens! Little man has a lama excuse to form a character midget like a baby. The story is horrible considering that it was written by six people. The idea would still not be too bad even though it was original and not a rip-off of a comic book. It has fun moments, but some of them are too finished, and some are just stupid. The action was very, very poor. So was the management. Anyone involved in this movie must be ashamed of themselves. It is racist and very offensive to midgets. I mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, the filmmakers make fun of them! It really spoils me how they do it. They see midgets are like babies. And for a character who is a midget, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a particular family. It's the lame excuse to show something like that. It just wasn't worth it. Don't watch this movie. It's a big waste of time and money.
