OK, I lost this from the TV and missed the start. The movie was about 10 or so seconds into the titles (I assume), so if something happened before I missed it. Many people say that Mark Hammill is in this, I didn't see him. I recognize Clive Barker, John Landis, and of course Stephen King does some really horrible acts as the cemetery attendant. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks nice except for the scenes where she has the cat's face or is in full alien make-up. <br /> <br /> Even with the opening titles, it's never really explained really well exactly what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title sequence, I assume that they are cat-like bipeds that live by extracting vitality from humans. I suppose they live a long time, and these special 2 may be the last of their kind. Add to this a very large dose of incest (yes! I thought it was a little suspicious too), shapeshifting, killer cats and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. It's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and too many cameo are trying to distract from the simple fact that it's not enough explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
