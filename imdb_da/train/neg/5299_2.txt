I really like slasher movies, but this one is really awful. The action is lame, the manuscript is bad, and the atmosphere is non-existent. The plot is as follows: A deformed gardener Charlie Puckett beats people in a small American town. That's right - this is the plot. Very original, eh! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not even gory enough - if the movie does not become scary, they must at least make it bloody. Volunteer this cheap piece of waste at all costs. To see some great slasher flicks, check out "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - don't waste your precious time with this worthless garbage can.
