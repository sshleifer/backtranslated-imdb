I can't believe I've just spent half an hour watching such a weak movie. If there is only one movie to miss, this is it. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father recently died so he starts hanging out with some local antisocial teenagers and using drugs. All of these unconsciously make him more violent and eventually explode this subconscious ... <br /> <br /> The first is that I don't think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this movie, not in any single sign. If the director thinks what I saw in the last few minutes as a big ecstasy, I have to say that it's not even close. The use of movies is also not mature. Most of the time I could not see any facial expressions from the actors, and I did not feel the body language was sufficient enough to affect. Perhaps the crew was just as tired that they got the camera there to include everything in the settings. All happy except the audience. <br /> <br /> The reason is particularly weak. There are many independent scenes and speeches that might be related, but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, perhaps unless you are the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In an hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting, and all the time, there are only people who go, talk, and move. So I really can't comment on shopping here. <br /> <br /> Great choice of music in the last few minutes. Maybe it's the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I never gave a movie a 1, but this movie deserves it safely (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a film about where an unsuccessful attempt to portray troubled teens meets extremely disturbed audiences. Hope you fall into neither group.
