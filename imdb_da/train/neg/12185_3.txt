What ever did Martin Scorcese have to resume this movie? And not only did he repeat it, destroy it completely? The nonsensical decision to make the character of Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance and it says a lot) to a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes belonging to Hollywood (and especially Scorcese) - attitudes that force writers To think that the best way to make a character crazy is to tattoo a crucifix on the back. In any case, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br />
