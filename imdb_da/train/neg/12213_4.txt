As 'First Blood', this tries to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam veterinarians, but there really isn't much time for it between the monotonous shots, burns, stabbings, torture and explosions as an impossible indestructible Rambo takes half out of Asia , a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, various vehicles, and anything else he can point to a rocket launcher. The only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, so testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a number of loud sounds. Helping deliver a few hackneyed musical characters is Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully checks all the clich√© themes from Russian rat-a-tat to Chinese ching chang-chong, only if we do not fully understand who we are looking at. Stallone has a brain in the head; This empty nonsense is under him.
