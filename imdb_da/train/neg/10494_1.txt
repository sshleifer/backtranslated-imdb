On Steve Irwin's show he is hillarious. He doesn't even try to be fun, and he's just, but his movie wasn't even what I wanted to call a movie. I mean, when that guy on his car tries to kill him, he just says, "Oh, it's an unpleasant bloke!" and looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too much! And then when the guy falls off, you wouldn't expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst play I had ever seen! Just as the crocodile almost ate Steve , she just says "Steve." She doesn't sound scared or anything, it was just "Steve." I mean I hate to sound, but it wasn't worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was just for stupid.
