I am a big fan of war movies, and as Vietnam camp teacher I have some experience with the technical details. I worked with the bombs more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians, and especially in Iraq veterinarians, have summarized the inaccuracies of this film very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military entities price match and discipline of a reason, it saves lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy with the mobile phone would have been shot immediately. Scratch, "Stop calling" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were extremely egregious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy does not know how to be a sniper, and thinking any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. To kidnap an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. Someone can shoot him, but this kind of risk assessment is limited to the movies. I could go on, but as I said, others have pointed out these things in detail. It's not a good movie, and if it wins any prizes, it's a further reflection of why "La La Land" is so named.
