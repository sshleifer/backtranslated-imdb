Two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We should have wanted a man called sled; BUT ..... <br /> <br /> BUT ... this picture is uncomfortable, annoying and stupid from start to finish. Since there is no one in history (good or bad) to warm up, nobody has to motivate the necessary tension to keep the viewer interested. No companionship among guys trying to steal the gold and no companionship among those trying to protect it. Sledge has a beautiful girl friend, but there is no reason why she beats the whole guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no account pigs. The movie also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score, and from extremely poor writing and direction by Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 older films rented from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the bottom, the only true dud in the pile.
