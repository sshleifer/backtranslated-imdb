I look around in the video store still in shock how Steven Seagal with his track record of Bad Action movies can still get 3 movies hit on the shelves of less than a Year.Attack Force, which is the 3rd no less promised first time entrance to Sci Fi Genre for our ever-growing Seagal. Visits to bad movie entertainment flashed before my enticed eyes. Seagal rebounded a little with the Trashy-but comfortable Shadow Man last time we saw him. But the force of attack must be his absolute worst movie ever! Don't argue for next to a Kill, Ticker or even Black Dawn people. This is the bottom of the septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's return to form must be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I am a top bad ass once again named Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his Team, leading him to a jail card to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public . Not to mention the dealers are not from here. <br /> <br /> The whole production from leading to the actor is poor. Was this movie shot in the dark? It must be the most badly lit movie since Howling 2. The action is horrible and very poorly finished. The producers have also decidedly decided to do what the fans hate the most: throw in stunt double after stunt double and terribly dubbed Steven Seagal. Who seems to show some enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> While it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie logged on (originally Harvester) and certainly must be better than Attack force.The post-production manipulation has not made it more coherent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad for director Michael Keusch and author Joe Hal pin as they have to be judged forever for the poorly recommended production trips. <br /> <br /> Now, Seagal lets in the impossible position come up with something to zone for this mess. But after seeing how bad the Attack Force has been, do we really want him to make another movie?
