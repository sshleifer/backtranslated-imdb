Take "Rambo", mix in some "Miami Vice", cut the budget around 80%, and you have something that some ten-year-old boys could bring if they have a big enough backyard and too much access to "Penthouse." Cop and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he is as greedy as they come) are recruited to retrieve an American super tank that has been stolen and hidden in Mexico. Caught with the tank was hard-wearing Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain's former love Devon (Fluegel), officer in command and now the flesh of the displaced terrorists / spies / addicts who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with outdated sex, there is a lack of action and not much sex. The current joke is that McBain is shot all the time and survives and keeps the balls as souvenirs. Apparently, the authors did not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("The man for us is the one who gave him that face"), nor intend to give McBain himself a sense of intelligence. Even for a budget trader, the production values ​​are poor, with distant images during dialogue and very little movement. The main plug, the tank, is stupid enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who might have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much larger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) Should go from simulation to scarecrow and back again at a moment's notice. Jones, who has been in a fantastic selection of movies, pretty much hits the bottom right here. Both he and Busey were probably just out for some easy money and a few laughs. Look for talented, future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotypical, threatening piece. Too boring even for a guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house, but wants people to think there is someone at home.
