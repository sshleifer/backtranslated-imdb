I may have seen worse movies than this, but if I have, I can't remember it. Or maybe blocked them out. Who knows if I was going to undergo hypnotherapy, I can remember them with, perhaps, abducted by foreigners as a child or other trauma. If so, I'd like to swap the reminders of those I love to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give the movie some credit: It gave an emotional response. I actually started to get angry at scenes that spoofed other movies and TV shows that this travesty dirty them by association. I'm afraid I might not be able to watch movies like Dr Strangelove again without this movie flirting over my eye.
