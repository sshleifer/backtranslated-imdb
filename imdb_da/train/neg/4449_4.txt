"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable, "beforehand" thriller that never seems to find any inspiration, no matter how desperately cast and the crew try. I can't believe a lot of my friends talked me about watching this at the cinema about 16 years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass manuscript (based on the Nancy Price short story) does not help, nor does Joseph Ruben's confused direction or the very average performance of Julia Roberts. The support molding, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, does little to help. There really isn't much to say. Just give it a miss. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
