I wanted to watch this movie, but a bizarre ridiculous scene after the other forced me to shut it down. Character does not seem to respond to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger goes one night (through a cemetery I believe) when he is attacked by spirits he drives away. Once past this trial, he goes quietly and meets a friend who saw it all. When asked what happens, he gently says "attacked by demons, nothing serious." As if it is just a little more exciting than a flat tire. I shut it off when they go and ask something - a demon or something I stopped caringly - a matter of ion. The answer can only be rented out by someone with the energy of their death, and the clergyman in what seems to be vague irritation when a man is tense and hung, and they ask about his threat, dying body issues. <br /> <br /> 0 out of **** stars.
