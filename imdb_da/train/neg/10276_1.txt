So you can read some of the comments posted on this movie and you can think of yourself. "Huh. There was probably a lot of RAVE REVIEWS published on December 30." Fun is, most of these rave reviews sound like they come from the same person, or at best a small coordinated group of "Open House" groupings. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is truly invisible. Just because it's "independent" doesn't mean it's a free passport. If you are going to make a musical, whether you are on film or on stage, whether you are on Broadway or in the playhouse in the community, you should probably make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance, (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can't save this. It is one of the unfortunate movie experiences where I actually felt deeply embarrassed by everyone involved.
