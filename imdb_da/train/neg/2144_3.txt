I've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and some other successors like The Lion King 2 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they try to do it by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most children don't care how good the original film was, they are just interested in the movie being entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
