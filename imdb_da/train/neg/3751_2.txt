I'm a big fan of David Lynch. However, this movie was a rather disappointing experience. Apart from the surrounding background music ?? who really sets the mood in the film ?? It lacks almost all the qualities I have come to relate to Lynch's work. The visions are boring, to say the least, and the dialogue is too vague and monotonous to be of any interest. This feels more like a movie student awkwardly trying to make an artificial dogma movie than the work of an experienced director. I have seen many amateur movies with much better camera work, scenery, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I feel that I see one of David's home movies, produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
