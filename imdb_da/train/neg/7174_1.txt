I wanted to read the other comments before I left my review and most rules clearly: This movie is aweful! From the play to the non-realistic animation to the countless mistakes. In fact, I hoped the flaps would have been prolonged by a fantasy unit (can't expand the flaps without motors). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have power. The tiny little fan that went was not enough with any stretch to lower the landing gear. The only thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched and then the nose broke out and thus suspended the aircraft with both rear tires in the air. How did the captain use the left and right brakes for tires that did not touch the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Words to the instructor: Find out * everything * you can about planes before attempting a "fly" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
