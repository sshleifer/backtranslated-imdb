There are two reasons why I didn't give one for this movie. One of the reasons is some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) who tried to play at their usual good level of acting. But on many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting. The other reason is the cool idea and look at Cyborg, which is quite different from most other roles I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be. Drilling scenes, useless and boring dialogues, poor script work. And it seemed like it was the first movie ever for many actors. However, it could have been an interesting story, but they failed completely.
