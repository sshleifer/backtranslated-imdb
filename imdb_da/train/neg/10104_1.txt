I only saw the first 30 minutes of this, and what I saw was a total piece of shit. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times BE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever, but it's not true; The idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! "Police Station" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign "Police Station" hanging on the wall. There is a fist where the battles are clearly missing around TEN FEET. <br /> <br /> This policeman pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse with a duffel bag. The politician may think that something is not true that his partner may be a poor policeman who kills these women, but he is not sure if that is what happens because he is a moron! The dialogue is quite stupid, the play is terrible, and the characters work in the dumbest way I've ever seen on the screen. It is quite obvious to the policeman's partner that he illegally abducts these women, and he knocks them down and takes them into a warehouse and returns to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, yet the partner is who's all over time does not know what happens! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie in 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It has to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen and I won't waste more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Completely carefree.
