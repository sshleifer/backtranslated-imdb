I absolutely fail to see what is fun in this movie. The mood seems to be destined for corpse. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not give much sympathy, a few important characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the authors think of this script? "Oooo fun! Let's make some old lady's tall potty! Let's make them .... giggle! Let's make them ... behave like little kids !! Oooo, yes, it's absolutely brilliant and original!" <br /> This movie has annoyed me most from all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
