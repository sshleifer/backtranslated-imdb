*** LITTLE SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> A 15-year-old boy is kissing a very cute 15-year-old girl and finally having sex for the first time. After the action, he puts himself in bed with her and does not touch her. The next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and will not try it again for at least a few years. This is apparently a fine opening for a boy about a boy who discovers his homosexuality, or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency. As the plot develops, what is emerging is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his indulgent mother. Exactly preaches his mother to her colleagues who are not as understanding as they could be: "Every step of this way my son has been amazing ... I have never been more proud of him ..." The young father's older sister who is otherwise cold to his brother begins to show pride in his siblings: "You've been cool about this," as she gives him an encouraging warm hug. <br /> <br /> The 15-year-old father will be the father. He wants to be a parent. <br /> <br /> Why not? We see the "new" baby a few minutes after the birth - it seems to be a healthy, well over 4 month old infant. Like babies were born on television in the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> When the young father is a parent, he has found happiness. He insists he will be the one to change the filthy diaper. We see the 15-year-old father sincerely fortunate in keeping his baby while the teenager's busy = body fat is on top of the shoulder. Dish for black.
