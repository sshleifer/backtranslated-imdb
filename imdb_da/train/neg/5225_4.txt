This Drummond post is lacking in continuity. Most of them have their elements in fragility, the delayed wedding, and so on. However, this has an infinite number of events that occur in near darkness, as the characters run from one place to another. The house seems more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is as openly suspected as nobody seems to be looking for. He's a stranger and seems quite suspicious, but Drummond and the people don't seem to pick up anything. Still, it is like a reasonably good action and a pretty good ending. I know Algie should be a comic book, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks, he's so nice that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence around him. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond were associated?
