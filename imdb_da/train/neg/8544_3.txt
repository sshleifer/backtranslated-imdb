I was never quite sure where this thing went. These people seem interested in what is going on on a mountain. They investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleepwalking, being attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected many times. She is taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again. You get points. It all seems to come around for some kind of victim, I think, but I'm not sure or people will be witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the pressure is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of darkness are not unusual. This is caused by age or overuse of night filters.
