What can I say, this is a piece of brilliant movie production that should have won an Oscar. A copy must be stored safely in a safe vault for posterity. It must be required for all high school students worldwide. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most brilliant author / instructor / producer / cook / babysitter / walmart greeter to ever enjoy the cinema world with his art. Where do I start with this? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so breathtaking! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he's so attractive I'm surprised he didn't go to Mr. Universe. I couldn't contain myself in the naked scene. I borrowed this movie for my brother and he called me on the phone and said how Arthur's naked scene turned him into gay. Of course, I'm completely supportive of this movie, and it's beautifully crafted tolerance lessons. Why yesterday I burned down a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in his crumbling ashes. The camera was the best thing about this movie. When the Fed-Ex plane went to heaven in the middle of Vermont's palms, I was crying! Why didn't I even know they had palm trees in Vermont or people could travel on Fed-Ex flights before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new potential. This movie inspired me to sign up for Sam Mraovich's School of Writing, Action, Executive, Composition, Casting, Production, Production Design and Real Estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr Mraovich. Thank you for creating this creation in the world. We can never pay you enough again."
