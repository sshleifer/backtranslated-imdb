I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie before I saw it on the block at Blockbuster. Being an Adam Sandler fan at that time I rented it. Honestly I could only see approx. 30 minutes. of the. It was awful. Do what is required to keep this out of the public. I honestly hope this movie goes OOP soon and I hope it stays that way!
