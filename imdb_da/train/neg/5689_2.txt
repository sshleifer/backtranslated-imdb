In the past year, Uwe Boll has shown marginal improvements as the film creator who outperforms the competent "In the King's Name" (a "Lord of the Rings" clone) and the proudly vulgar post-9/11 satire "Postal." But then "Seed" came, and the counter was reset to Zero and kept his bid for legitimacy and respected it much further out of reach. And I'm a fan of the guy? His film shows a unique scrub view and is never boring. <br /> <br /> Struggled by his frustration with the game, his early films, "Seed", noted a tremendously misunderstood attempt at social commentary, and an even worse jab by creating an iconic slasher mythology (Ball often seems to take a page from Rob Zombies successful restart of "Halloween"). The antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a mute, hulking brute, who killed 666 people and sits on death row, awaiting execution; After rising the animal, he got up from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there ... and then a strict complete freedom begins. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a new millennium slasher in the vein of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too non-descriptive and boring to leave an impression that ultimately resembles a pre-washed pro wrestler who does "The Toolbox Murders" on a number of equally boring victims. In addition, Seed's character and Boll's "message" run counter to each other: the death penalty is wrong, but are we really expected to sympathize with a rare killer who has left a few hundred corpses in his wake? I do not think. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Michael Pare seems like an alarmless, far-lost brother of James Remar's character on "Dexter": a policeman sitting at the desk a lot and tumbling through newspaper clippings and watching pointless stop-motion scenes of destructive animals and people caught in Seed's lair. As he and a lot of cardboard polish storm Seeds hide, the sequence is so pronounced, unimaginable (the lighting is almost non-existent) and unexciting (despite a healthy dose of gore) that it almost makes me sleep. <br /> <br /> The foamed film production is not limited to this particular order: "Seed" seems to have been shot by a drunken filmographer, as the camera bobs and weaves infinitely, a technique that is more belly-twist than gore itself ; These long-lasting forces of very little incident only draw attention to the meandering, almost non-existent narrative. In 90 minutes, the movie is distanced enough to be considered a form of torture that might have been Boll's intention all the time. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I suppose joke is on me.
