Good actors and good performances cannot mask a meaningless script, poor dialogue and behavior patterns that sprout into something you want to worry about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No sign development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering without any particular reason, teaches us nothing and does not even bother to entertain.
