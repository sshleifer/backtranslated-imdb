Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (a violently mistaken Bette Davis) is engaged to be married to stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and kidnapped her by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. Seriously). They collide land in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) begins to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are in it. They were both brilliant actors, but they were known for drama NOT comedy and this movie shows why! The script is just awful - it's not a real laugh in the whole movie. The running joke in this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first in a cactus (this is done three times!). Only their great talents save them from being completely humiliated. As they are, they both do their best with the miserable material. Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full power, but it doesn't work. Carson has this "what the hell" look at his face throughout the movie (probably because his character's feelings change in seconds). Only Palette with its distinctive voice and over the top readings need to evoke a few smiles. But all in all, this was boring and laughable - a real task to sit through. This only gets two stars for Cagney and Davis' plays and some beautiful movie pictures, but really - it's not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in recent years and you can see why.
