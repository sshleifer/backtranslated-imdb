WILL NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE. I have wasted time and money on this and am beautiful on it. <br /> <br /> The action is comparable to high schools. Scripture is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (which I think I should be rewarded for reaching), I had headaches from all the screaming, crying and mocking the five girls do. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence is (rarely for a movie today) suggested rather than graphically depicted, but I found the signs so terribly annoying that I wanted to see them and every person involved In making this piece, die in the most horrible ways. <br /> <br /> I spend ten minutes saving you from a very bad 100 minutes. Don't do it.
