Looked at the tv late last night. Yes, I can hear what you say about this. It will probably be categorized as one of the stereotypical television soap series. In all fairness, the story line has a fine twist to it, and you may not say, "Well, that wasn't what I expected." But as a movie, it is not easy to see a redeeming element. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there is nothing to congratulate. Nominated R ?? Oh, that scene. Did we need it? This is a movie that you can watch and forget about yourself. And what was the title again?
