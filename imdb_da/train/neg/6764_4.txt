NATURAL DRILL KILLER (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director's Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> When I read he was on drugs during the film, I didn't need any further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, sour, all-out film production that we don't get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic images. 'Natural Born Killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers became popular and glorified by the media; There is a big scene where an interviewer asks some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says 'Murder is wrong .... but if I was a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory'. Mickey describes this with a situation of 'Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein '- Dr. Frankenstein is the medium that has transformed them into these monstrous killers <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone films investigate the shortcomings of America, the country the director loves and admires. I think "Natural Born Killers" is about mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, the Americans (and most of the world) are over things like mass killings and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The kills played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are amazingly performed by two excellent actors who enter into the lives of two exciting brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (the survival of the most qualified) - Mickey says in his prison interview that other species are committing m species and exploit the environment; The manuscript is interesting, but it is doubtful how much this film constitutes, in the sense of making us think of society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of a 2-hour carnage that we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison we see the hard realities of prison life; sustainability attitudes, etc. Overcrowding of prisons - perhaps Stone is questioning the future, the path that society leads to. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show on 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with increasing ratings that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane and perhaps sadistic officer in love with Mallory - he also has a strange occupation of mass murderers when his mother was killed during the massacre in Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> The camera is amazing; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; The greenest color that is most visible to everyone is green to resemble the killer's disease (in the pharmacy when looking for resistance to rattlesnake). <br /> <br /> Camera work is angry; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to make use of it and accept it. Very unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. "Natural Born Killers" does not glamorize the existence of insane killers, it questions it, and how we as the public can burn this feature ... <br /> <br /> Although the above review sounds pretty positive, not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not happy with the changed script, and he asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While it is mildly interesting, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a picture. <br /> <br /> 4/10
