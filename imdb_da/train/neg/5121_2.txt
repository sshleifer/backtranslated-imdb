I went into this movie and thought it would be a nice football drama (in the same vein as Remember the Titans); But I got away feeling like I had just attended a Ted Haggard sermon on the rapture. The only thing missing was the request for a tenth at the end of the movie. In fact, one would probably get more out of a television story than this bad excuse for entertainment. At least with the television story, there are quotes from Scripture instead of quotes from popular self-help masses. The reason was completely foreseeable to the point that anyone with a long enough attention could have put the whole plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie.
