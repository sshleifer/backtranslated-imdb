I first saw this movie on MST3K. And even though I was laughing behind in the jokes, I don't really think that this movie was so bad. Sure it was a little hard to understand that it's definitely low budget, but it had a very Hitchcock-like plot, and I can honestly say that when I looked at the non-MST3K version, I was really entertained. This movie is crying for a Hollywood remake.
