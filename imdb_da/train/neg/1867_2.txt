Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing to spoil that movie. Although B. Mattei had never done any masterpiece, he used to do his work with some humor and madness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But in the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it. This movie is just empty, not to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 minutes. No sex, it's enough to assume snuff?), No actors, no dialogues, just as bad as a 90'TV movie. It is even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics. So resting in peace Bruno, you will remain in our minds forever forever thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, Cruel Jaws and get others.So except if you want to see B Mattei obsessed with jess Franco's new movie, pass on this. But if you don't know this fine artisan career track his old movies and have fun.
