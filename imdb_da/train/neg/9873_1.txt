I saw it with my mother, and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We didn't get it at all. I may be wrong, but a chair had something to do with this woman's father. The movie was horrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good excitement movie. Bad tension movie! * shakes pipes by film * I never see it again. And I am also a big fan of lifetime movies! They must stop trying to make movies out of books. It drives me wildly! <br /> <br /> And Whit was crooked-ugly, yet she loves him more than Hugh, who was a bit nicer. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
