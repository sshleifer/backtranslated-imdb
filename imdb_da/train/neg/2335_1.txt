A movie so uncertain that the creators might have hoped to milk an original movie noir classic title, "Goodbye My Lovely", thinking the happy would assume it a remake. The signs are so evil and unpleasant that it deserved its cold reception when they were first released. The time only adds to its absurdity. Having none of the guile, cinematography, desperation or despair of the classical noir relied instead on an enchanted and pointless crime plot that would easily have resulted in more arrests within hours. As if that were not enough, it threw in a completely sexless attempt at eroticism, where at least one of the participants had not bothered to bathe in several days. This only made this mess more painful to see. Find a good classic eighties or fifties movie noir instead of wasting two hours on this error.
