I usually just write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked. And as you probably can tell from the number of stars up there, I didn't like it. Now I assume that you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie, so I will skip the summary. Let's break it down, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The concept: The priest was created to be interesting. The use of chaos theory as a theme was interesting. However, it was not done as well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that chaos theory was a little wrong. The event that arose in the movie seemed more like a coincidence coincidence than anything. I think the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God (s) causing the tsunami to bring back the statue." The presentation comes out that really sloppy though. Some people call this intelligent, but it just seems to be another soup film. <br /> <br /> Storyline: Is it just me or does Kamal just throw it together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The reason is extremely constructed; Govind continued to lose the vial so many times in blurred accidents (his friend just blended the vial with a package he sent to India, a crazy old lady just throwing the vial into an idol. Unexpectedly meeting in the same hospital, and The case of the idol happened just with one who belonged to a famous singer.) CGI: Oh God, CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 and they sucked. Immediately I could see which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like this. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yes, I am now that action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stunts in this were horrible and actually distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Make up: I have to admit they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me guarding. But it was still pretty bad, I could easily tell who was wearing masks. <br /> <br /> The songs: The music was distracting and out of place in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her character might be the most annoying in the movie. She was tall, ditsy and obsessed with that idol. In fact, I found that I wish she would die. Plot Holes and Fridge Logic: Let me get it right: a lab was smart enough to get past a password-locked door, but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a chocolate box and a vial of a deadly virus in it. And then an ex-CIA agent, who is after the vial, is aware that it is heading for India. Instead of immediately following it, he first married a pole dancer. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer control for a small city hospital in the Third World, as he could easily afford the best medical treatment. In addition, he is shot in the throat with a ball. You think he would be killed, but instead the magic ball has cleared his tumor. You read it right, a BULLET knocked out of the tumor. <br /> <br /> Benefits ... The Naidu Character: Possibly the only equal part of the movie was his comedy.
