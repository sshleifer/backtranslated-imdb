This is not a very good story about the Tarzan era. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in buff! Bo Derek in '10' was at least a humorous movie, and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is no more than soft porn. If you are in it, yes, so fast forward to it and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was once again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show her horrible plays. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; this was one of his few mistakes! Don't waste your time on this movie ... go buy the book instead.
