At a panel discussion that I attended after watching this movie, the filmmakers said that one should look at this not as a movie, but a spokesman. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked by me were prematurely wasted watching the movie. The movie's gimmicks (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as disruptions to what should be a careful study of abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use movies as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir.
