*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British made "thriller" released in the US by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff has to retire to France and start a medical practice. He is made by a passing woman who wants to get rid of her much older man. She knows that Karloff needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with the proposal and soon becomes the man's personal doctor. All the time wife is prancing about the city with the local no good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks. But his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and finds out that the will has changed. When he wastes the beans to the wife, she goes to childbirth and even bites her hand. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Karloff's nurse has misplaced the hypo Karloff who used to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out that he does not get money, he asks the wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the lack of hypo. Analysis shows poison, but not quite on time when Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short, the nurse goes away, gets the police and manages to save the son to be injected by karloff Karloff instead injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff possesses and plays the kind of crazy doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man who lived again. However, it's strange to see him walking around stiffly and slightly hunched over. We never find out why he goes this way. I suppose the director thought it made him more vicious. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays 2-timing wife takes on something terrible. She has a French accent. Even though she is exaggerating badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate because of her action). <br /> <br /> Slightly below the average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the sound is a bit choppy.
