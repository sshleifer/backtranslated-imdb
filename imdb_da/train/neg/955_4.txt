I don't think any Hollywood story player lasted as long as David Niven had given most of the weak movies he had to wear dint of his incredible charm. He could trade, get an Oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as easy as a layer of two layers of tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a case in point. It is a musical and for the most part you will remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will remember that they are in Scots costume when the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember a single song from it, you need a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The reason is light. Vera-Ellen is the American leader in a musical who apparently gets her out of town tryout in Edinburgh. She starts in the choir and runs late one day. She gets a lift from the driver to a millionaire congratulation king. Everyone now assumes that she is the biggest clamp on the millionaire. Doors open as they have never opened before. <br /> <br /> The environmentalist is David Niven and he goes along with it and the various situations created by the error. Cesar Romero has some great moments here as the hectic producer of this musical. In the end, however, Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless fluff, as David Niven did so much and became so tired of.
