This must be the WORST movie ever !!! The action is frightening than the movie. Lots of blood, but no idea where it comes from, cuz, they don't even show you the cuts. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a disgrace to horror movies !!! For one, if they are in Asia, why is there a white politician driving past garbage disposal? There is so much of a different language that you don't even know what's going on half the time. File editing is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and the nasty old man worked the window that would be the first link. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! DO NOT NEVER SEE WHAT BAD IT IS TO BE SORRY YOU !!
