Sure, we all like bad movies at some point and we actually enjoy them. However, it wasn't even a guilty pleasure, it was just bad. Some guy, vince offers, enough to make the main character, but probably both have enough drunk / loud - and it was a good idea to make a movie. He then proceeded to show his script to equally high / drunk individuals. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable and unoriginal I couldn't get through 20 minutes before I knocked it off. This means that you got served, looks like Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF ... Some guy walking around with a bat, genuine original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a fat guy walking around in a superhero outfit.
