Greenway's films are so clever, honest and innovative. Still, his style and grammar come from viewers of films made in the First World War era of film making: the composition of the frame, the use of mid-shot, the static camera. It may be good to rub against ordinary movies with this style, but it's not new. Perhaps like the other "innovator", TS Eliot, he pulls more from the past than in the future as an authentic innovator would or could. <br /> <br /> But Greenway's biggest failure is that he can't write. His dialogue and even plan structure is mechanical and logical, but without vitality from another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most evident is in his humor that is clear and logical so that joke is dead before it is delivered. The result is tedium: if it is not fun, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their action if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the well-known director could learn something from Freud on humor. Finally, Greenaway, like Woody Allen, has manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They speak the lines with a dull, odorous air as narcissist youth. <br /> <br /> Despite its design and lighting, this film is more noticeable.
