... but I regret having seen it. Since the ratings on IMDb are relatively high (and they must also have been relatively high on Netflix), I suppose I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK, a category that has produced many movies, I liked tremendously. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of grumpy comedies, which are usually popular by Hollywood films produced and directed by the talented. Brenda Blethyn is an accomplished actress and I have wanted her in other films. The concept - a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome the purse she is confronted with after her husband's death - does not offend me. Despite the strenuous efforts of the role produced to produce humor, the film falls flat on the face (falling flat on the row, it may have been more fun) for me and my wife. Be warned, oh gentle reading, not all rude British comedies succeed. This one is a dud.
