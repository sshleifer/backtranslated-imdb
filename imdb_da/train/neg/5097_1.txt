Unlike most other commentators, I very much hate this series. <br /> <br /> It's starting to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes for the very first episode. At the end of the day, I still didn't understand what the foreign attacks were about (maybe I missed something, who knows?) And realized that I had passed 26 episodes that mainly consisted of the characters' own self-esteem, selfishness and self-pity . It actually shifts between alien / robot battles and those dark, depressing flashing scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout "I hate me / you / it" 10-12 times in a row. <Br /> <br /> I really can't see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the protagonists) showing growth or change. Neither can I kick them and tell them to get a bloody life in the first episodes, and the feeling did not change during the last. Shinji really possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry, rather than charitable, and Asuka is such a disturbing know-it-all that I would smash the TV screen every time she appeared. Oh, and more than anyone else, all these two hate and say it often. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I'm a big fan of anima and manga, and never before have I not liked such a lot. I read that the series creator / writer wrote this while suffering from a depression and I can believe it; It made me depressed to see it. Is that the goal of this series? I honestly ask. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if you suffer from a depression, why not write a book or biography about it instead of mixing it with foreigners and mecha? This alien war plan, as far as I could tell, leads to absolutely no place. Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork with blind spots, I can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good and how many say they do because they've got it knowing it is.
