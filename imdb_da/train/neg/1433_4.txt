Pictures are great and well reflect Canada's landscapes. The story, on the other hand, was rather boring; For my eyes, it was a love story in the woods like the Titanic was a love story on a boat. I did not feel that Gray Owl was a great environmentalist. I like Lord Attenborough, but one was ... bad.
