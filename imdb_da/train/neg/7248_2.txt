When his in-laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs, a young substitute is ordered to escort his stupid friend, who is forced to rap the tire, to Tucson's trials and end up having to meet the right killers along the way. <br /> <br /> The Decoy is a reality decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better movies! It is talkative, illogical, slow and ultimately very boring. There are some good costumes, sets and photography, but nothing else is good with this vanity project from author / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink, who apparently had too much money on his hands. They used to make westerns like this, which was under an hour long. Trim this by about half, it's length and you can have something to see.
