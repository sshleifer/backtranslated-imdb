The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me to be the worst movie I've seen to this date. I didn't think it was possible to top my list of bad bad b movies, but this one deserves the gold. It is not fun. It's bad to act, it's badly filmed and the story is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is it has three girls in it. I really think this flick has the potential to knock on the second Danish movie "Stars Without Brains" as the worst Danish movie ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
