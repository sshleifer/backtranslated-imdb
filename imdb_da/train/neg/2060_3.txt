A repressed housewife (an annoying lamenting Angie Dickinson whose body doubles / horrifies us with an extreme close-up of her delicate) is boringly saddened by her husband and decides to spread. This results directly in a series of murders that soon involve a first-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, I'm clearly wrong if she can bring home $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you want to see De Palma rip off (excuse me, "greet") Hitchcock, see "Sisters" instead of this. "Dressed to Kill", while loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the wisest thrillers I have had dissatisfaction with passing through. The reason is absurd and tired. It has some surprisingly effective jumpers and ugly graphical killings that should please any horrible fan as long as they can get past the stupid storyline that must have been dated even in 1980.
