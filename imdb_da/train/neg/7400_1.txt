I've seen some pretty bad movies, and that's right up there. No plot to talk about, it's like one of the bad coma episodes on a soap opera. I just wanted to sneak the little girl because we can just say she's really suspicious all the way through the movie. The monsters running around with a little bling were fun. I also saw a little "Silent Hill" in there. And I read that this was done by, and or stared a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it's no wonder it didn't make much sense. It seems to be a means of promoting that band and no more. The FX is very good, the film's appearance, the monsters, and even the play is also good. But the story and the story of it is just not there.
