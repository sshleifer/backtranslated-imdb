I don't know what would be so good with this movie. Even worse, why would anyone like to see this? First of all, there is no history. One could say that even without a story, a movie could be worth watching because it relies on a kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie doesn't. <br /> <br /> You are only looking at pictures for +/- 2 hours. There are several useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you could say the movie is an experiment and it's bold because it lacks everything above. But is it worth 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is: no.
