Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically has everything on the show! Well, if that idea doesn't intrigue you, as it shouldn't be, stay away from the ringmaster. I was dissatisfied with seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess in a movie. I think jerry jumper doesn't play himself as it shows from the cheap props to his show (yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry jumper show) and he's only known as jerry in the movie. The reason (if you can call it) is about a daughter while living with her mother, deciding to start sleeping with her mother's life in girlfriend. So the mother's brilliant idea is to call jerry jumping the show and to get it on with her daughter's girlfriend. (Is it random that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, a woman somewhere else in American her cheatin 'husband finds with her girlfriend in bed together. So, of course, call America's therapist Jerry Springer! I want to talk about the rest of the movie, but even thinking about the movie now gives me headaches. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, looks completely uninteresting in the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff kick ass karate the American ninja series champion? Now look at him now as a white waste full. The thing is, he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it "getting in touch with his charecter". But if your idea of ​​fun is to watch Jerry Springer sing a country song about his own show or guys who are connected to transvestites ... well ... WILL YOU CHOOSE THE SHOW INSTALLED! ... at least steve was smart enough to stay away from this flick.
