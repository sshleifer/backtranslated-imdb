It's hard to criticize this movie because I don't like the story itself and no number of good plays would have saved it. Think "Raising Arizona" with an average stripe. The action is acceptable, but Jennifer Tilly is way above the top (yet not enough to make this a delicious camp movie) as usual, entering somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the casting has their forehead forever knitted in disturbance, either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole infertile exercise. A really degrading few hours of movies. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I went out, sorry.
