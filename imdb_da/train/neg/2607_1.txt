I watched the movie recently and it looks like the book is based on. I blame this on poor manuscript and direction. Some parts were forced to introduce (gay rapes) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many different ideas introduced to no benefit whatsoever ... except for sensational parts at present. As it covers things that were considered "sensitive", at least, under Communism, I can see the fascination it produced at that time. This is not the case anymore, although I might see things differently now or a little bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects of the book, the result is a collection of scenes that can make sense to anyone reading the book. Still, it is a movie that is hard to look at and might never have been made.
