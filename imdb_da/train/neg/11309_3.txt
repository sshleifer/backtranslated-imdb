Bad place (though good for a B-movie), good fast-paced scenes, a maximum of 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this movie: how will Mariska Hargitay never speak? In the television version she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. But in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she doesn't talk at all. This disturbs me because it not only takes a female (though clich√©) view of the movie, it also makes the final shot scary. This movie would have been better if they had kept their scenes because at least in these scenes she has a personality, one that suppresses what Speakman says.
