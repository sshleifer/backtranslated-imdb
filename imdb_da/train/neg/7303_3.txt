Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the manuscript of a story by Roth.this a zombie film due to George Romero and his former live dead movie and to the Original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to name Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead". There is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. The action is on par with this genre, it's just that story fails. We have pretty much seen this movie before and done better. Having said that after gaining commercial, if not artistic success from this film, Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally dreadful, meaningless, meaningless (but much more ambitious) crap party Hostel.Roth should have stopped while he was behind. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, but compared to Hostel it is a work of art. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this guy that filmmaking is the wrong career opportunity. Cabin fever, a weak 3/10 for not being as aby narrow as the Hostel.
