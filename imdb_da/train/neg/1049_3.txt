This movie has a lot of Broadway feeling - the background, the play, the "noise" - and yet it's all it has. Someone 'feeling' of a Broadway without bang. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, the picture is uninhibited, the song "pops up" on you, so you are suddenly reminded that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> Incompatible: Sinatra's fiance --- sure, pitch and accent of voice was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Mr "I remember the numbers on my dice". Delight: Brando's underrated song (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in his Havana scenes. It's the bone structure! How I would have killed for seeing Miss Leigh in a challenging Brando again.
