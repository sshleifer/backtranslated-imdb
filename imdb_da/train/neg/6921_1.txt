I went to a prescreening of this movie and was shocked at how cheesy it was. It was a combination of all horror / thriller cliches, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, satan worship, undercover police, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the play was beautifully washboard; the child and the Jesus guy were okay, but apart from them .... Anyways. I admire the effort (albeit a little unsuccessfully) on trying to show the Christian people another way ... even though they did, was the way it presented the gospel, a little warehouse and kiddish. But then it may have been since he was talking to a young child ... no. In fact, I have decided that it is just as bad. music ... oh my gosh ... horrible ... toooo over-dramatic. Okay. I felt bad for the people who made this movie on the premiere; It looked like a poor student project. I'm going to stop ranting about this now and say the bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap. Here you go.
