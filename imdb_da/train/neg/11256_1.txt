What a waste of time! I have tried to sit through "Sky Captain .." about 6 times, and every time, within approx. 3 minutes, I start to do something else - something else! It's a downright boring movie, the play is terrible, the writing is boring, and of course a first-time director, because it's stiff and I would love it. I love sci-fi, the old stingers, and I appreciate the attempt to nod to Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God, what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they would never have any interest or need. 10 years later, Paramount Sherry was released in 1993, but forgot about her own advice when she was breeding this dog. Blue screen is an effect shot, but not a whole movie. Let's not forget either Jude or Jolie are great actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - it could have worked oath, but only under a skilled director. The fun is, Sky Captain's director will continue to work even after this drunk. It's trade, not art!
