Nightmare Weekend stars are a cast of ridiculous actors with even less idea what is going on than the director had if you can imagine. There is no declarable plot or story, the special effects are a joke, and even the sound is horrible. This movie was directed by Henry Sala. It was the only movie he had ever directed, and the reason is obvious.
