I don't think you can get much worse than this. Add bad actors, false limbs and three stupid stories, and what do you get? This B-rate, meaningless excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the poor video quality, and the play is just very pathetic, especially when you bring in the 25-year-old bag as a grandmother with usually grandma bun over the ears bite. Plus, the man is ok, but the woman is pretty nasty. "You look good!" DOES NOT! Werewolf in this one was the best of all three I would say, but it was still not impressive as it was all bad costume. The face of the woman was later decent enough for halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go through the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in this next who are completely retarded, this is ridiculous. The whole "I will also be a werewolf" "How could you do it for me?!" Be silly to say. You asked for it now! Werewolf won't even be spoken of ... it's a rat! The third has no meaning ... almost forty-five minutes of running and boring narrative make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn't make it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who couldn't even hear some parts, it was stupid. Animal effects were either rat or pig-like, which was silly. They could not use the slogan? Don't guess, good movies use it. Well, I = f you enjoy B rates, that's good for you. I have this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I want to buy some werewolf movies and watch it more than once, but it's just me. If you prefer good, don't waste your money. I beg you!
