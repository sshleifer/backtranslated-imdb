I would probably always go to a Woody Alleb movie that you never know when he can just make a real return to his former greatness. Only one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. unfortunately, but this movie just doesn't make any score. To say it does make me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody, but what can you say? It is enough time for him to concentrate on his clarinet, which in my opinion he is quite good. When I say all this, I'll probably move on to any new movie that Woody can bring in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect The WOODY !!
