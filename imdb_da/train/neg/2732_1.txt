When 'My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu' was sent last season, I was happy about it. Scrubs, I thought, do something smart and unique with regard to the clip-show concept. Instead of playing recordings, they play jokes in a self-conscious way, and I've really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. A season later they gave up what almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show ... and it looked like it was being put together by the work experience child. Dr Cox's shaved head shows how lazy the editors were putting it together as it didn't show up again until 'My Long Goodbye' 4 episodes later. I can't imagine that a gem is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-built sitcom. Who knows why it was beaten there, it just seemed lazy and out of place, and reminded me (largely) of episodes that have aired within the past year. Three-second clips attached with background music is a DVD extra for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime-time television.
