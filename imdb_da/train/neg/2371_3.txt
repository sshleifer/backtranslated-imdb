I'm not a big Freddy Krueger fan, but that doesn't mean I don't like Robert Englund and his second nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. No one plays a better Freddy Krueger than He does. But no offense Robert, this movie sucked. The action is horrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the casting that is even worth seeing. Sometimes, successors may be better than the first ones, such as. Friday the 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But it's not one of those movies. The original was good, the 2nd in my opinion was better, the 3rd was okay, but I got it, t seen the others. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I made by seeing this piece of shit.
