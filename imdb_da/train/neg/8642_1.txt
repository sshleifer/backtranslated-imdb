I have to say that this is a horrible movie, plainly that when you watch this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. When I saw it, I started laughing and thinking about myself, does this guy actually expect me to think this is real? So I had to look up and now see that it's a movie, but now that it's not a documentary, it's now a movie with bad acting. So in some way it's pretty bad. I didn't actually make it to the end. I had to shut it off. I am a policeman in NYC and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intention of making money on a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So I took it a little personally. Maybe I was blinded by it, and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
