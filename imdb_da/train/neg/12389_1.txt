Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is violently raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of his sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is brought to court, but goes completely free. He then raped Kathy! <br /> <br /> Damaging and ill rape film. This film was announced as an important drama dealing with rape. What it is is a poorly written and (mostly) badly acted drama. It claims to be sympathetic to the victim's rape, but changes the scene in our face. To be honest, however, Hemingway's acting is so bad in the sequence that it loses any real influence it may have had. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went just too long when 15-year-old Mariel was raped (fortunately it was not shown). However, I admit that it led to a great ending when Margaux takes a gun and shoots Sarandon's death. But seriously - having a young girl rape is just disgusting. <br /> <br /> Action does not help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was definitely a beautiful woman (and an actual model I think), but her acting left much to be desired. It reduces the film. Mariel was just okay, but it was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as rapes. He was not bad, but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember that by screening this back in 1976, some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed, so maybe this works for some people. I found this boring, simplified and really sick. A 1 all the way.
