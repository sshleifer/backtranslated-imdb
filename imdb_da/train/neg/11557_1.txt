* SOILER * It's false! It's all a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or such will the castle and his title for himself. So he invests this overly complicated and unnecessary pointless plan for SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide. Most of the film is that he chooses redhead and attacks them. He doesn't even kill them. He falls asleep and the girl disappears and he thinks he buried them somewhere. If he looked at Evelyn's so-called ghost, he could tell she was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Don't see it, rent it, and if you've bought it and haven't seen it yet, then sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from the night between, come from the tomb. I give this stink CRAP-O-LANTERN.
