... for Lt to have chosen this one. First, the movie was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst case I need-this-to-do-or-we-not-movie scenario: if Willi's mission was to save the doctor, but she was firmly convinced that her "people" were doing it out of the missionary , he would have put her on the first helicopter and marched these refugees to the border without her. He would not have compromised his package for the refugees. This is not how it works. But as I pointed out, it's Hollywood, we need drama. That's why we make movies because reality is not quite that complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had a useful chemistry. That said, there are also some well-finished battle scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be happy.
