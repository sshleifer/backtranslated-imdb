I can almost understand why some people might want to emphasize the movie's link with the 1980s, but I really don't want to say that it is a precise portrayal of most people's lives during that time - even on the poorest Bradford properties. However, it is typical of the dumb agitprop waste that the dear old Royal Court Theater struck at that time. Lots of 'right-on' artistry for small, small audiences, but probably well-connected back slapping to secure future commissions for turgid playrights. The simple fact is that if you want to reflect on more threatening common experience, you will find millions more nodding in knowing the consensus to love and live as depicted in 'Gregory's Girl'. <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to call this a 'kitchen sink' drama, but it would make a big disservice to the plumbing industry. But as for having a decent script is concerned, this movie is actually washed up. For some reason, it has faced an odd successor among Guardian reading movie-goers - I can only assume they get a visual frisson from pretending to slumber it. Clear my friends. It's a bad movie with a poor script that likes to think it breaks boundaries by adding humorous insights into the gloomy life on the lands. it is not .. but it is cloudy. Dishwashing instead.
