Bad Tobe Hopper. He instructed an all-time horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then, everything he has done has been terrible. This is probably the worst ... and it says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to get things (and people) to fire ... or something. Hardly an original idea (someone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally everything's done wrong! Pathetic action (even Dourif!), Asinin script, loust production values, crappy special effects ... everything is bad !!!!! A must miss ... not even good for laughs.
