I walked into this movie after seeing the 82-minute "Borat" tonight, and left quite disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and routinely go to watch animated movies. That said, I found myself nodding and at one point almost went out, but kept waiting for this movie to get better. It never happened. <br /> <br /> The picture is amazing and the voice work is exquisite, especially in my opinion, namely Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a few times that the pear-shaped lizard villain was Gandalf and magneto). The problem with this movie for me is that it is one of the animated features for ADD sets. It is recorded after the fact that a zany slapstick routine after another is weighed down by a treacle-filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an "important message." It looks a lot like busted Oscar bait for the animated category, and given the way it scores with critics, I wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers its hardware. But if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
