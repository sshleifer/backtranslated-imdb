If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a movie about the slavery's institution, which is still widespread in the world of third countries, the film could have been better received. Instead, it becomes a starburst disaster of a movie where the stars came in, said their lines and retrieved their payslips without much conviction. Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy making their humanitarian stuff in East Africa. In addition, Peter Ustinov comes, who can hardly summon enough ham in him to make part of it as a Muslim slave dealer. When Johnson is black, he still catches up with many children and a few adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine does not take on the kidnapping and the rest of the movie is used in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and the Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in parts and look so incredibly sad. <br /> <br /> Normally, in something like this talented people like the above, just overdoing outrageous and feasting on a diet of scenery will just. But Ashanti doesn't even have it going. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax depreciation permeates the air.
