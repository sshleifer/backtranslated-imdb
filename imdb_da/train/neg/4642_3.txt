I saw "Rachels Attic" and thought I would be in favor of a nice visceral ride. However, that was not the case. Visceral, yes, but fun? It would be a big, bold, no! In fact, the only reason I gave it a "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (always so short) as one of the film's reprehensible characters. How they ever lured Mr. Hansen into this job, I never know. The story idea is interesting but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and acting is mediocre. The only thing worse than that is the special effects. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in a classroom game. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear they're hiring at Mel's Diner! There are very few, well made, Indeed movies coming out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
