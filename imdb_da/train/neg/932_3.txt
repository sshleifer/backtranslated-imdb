I saw this movie and hoped for something to improve all the time. What's so good about a guy without feelings? * gab * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex show emotions to anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that is why his son is the only one who makes him lose his temper (if you can call it that). I get it. The signs are undeveloped, relationships are not given enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she talks about how his death really shook her up because they were so dense? Logical synapses are found in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's like someone saw Boogie Nights and wrote this part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene where he "loses his mood" is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife down to facial expressions (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - has been there, done it - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This movie not only lacked emotions, lacked fabric, good script, developed characters, and a plot. And it certainly lacks my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
