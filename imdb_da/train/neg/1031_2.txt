This movie is a long chiche after another. First of all, even though they did their share, there is an unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is the unpleasant, enviable, gay, slave to Yoko, portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even continue to spray song titles in a regular conversation "it was always just two of us"! John would not have been to his fans like this either. As his death showed us that he was too good if anything. The one funny scene is where a stupid Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's yesterday. An offended John says something like "safe and while I croon why don't you come down on your knees, put your wife's wig and lick me up". It made me laugh for days. Really this movie is fun in how serious it is trying to be while it comes out of ridiculous. John and Paul did not sit all day, they were funny, light-hearted, who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable than portrayed here. Forget it.
