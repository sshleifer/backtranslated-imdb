Now I'm the one to watch movies that got bad reviews and say, "Hmm ... it's not that bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Remember, I really didn't start to see this with great hopes, but I figured that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be hurt in a way that I could laugh at it. I was mistaken. At no time at all during my suffering through this "movie" (and I use this term sparingly) I was even close to being mildly entertained. To start, Shaq Quentin Tarantino makes Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could tell, an Amish priest would probably do a better rapper than him. The protagonist is simply annoying and not a sign that is easy to like. Frankly, I'd rather eat a greasy turd out of a bloody wound from the Harlequin fetus than see it again.
