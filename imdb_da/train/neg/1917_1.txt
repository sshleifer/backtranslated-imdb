This movie, but not bad, should have been filmed where the actual events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was destroyed by no less than seven tornadoes at night on June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the nearly thirty flat Platte River Valley in Hall county. The actors of this movie were filmed in Ontario's wood-covered hills and moved the entire event to a non-existent city called Blainsworth. People on Grand Island poorly survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a badly made movie.
