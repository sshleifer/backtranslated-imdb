This seems like one of the movies we think we want, but I didn't. It seemed too hard to be 'artistic'. All flash, without content. It has some beautiful scenes, and one of them is nice to watch, but thank you all and it will be a difficult task to just sit through. I rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video board and the fact that I am a great Shakespeare fan, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a little pretentious and sometimes boring.
