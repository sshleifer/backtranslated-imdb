It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the advertised movie on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes passed, after the 30 minutes and I didn't even laugh. The fact is that the film ended, and I didn't even get to laugh. PLEASE, someone tickles me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
