Knowing Enki Bilal's comics for some time, I had to watch this movie. I thought this would be a good way for the artist, as Bilal spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend and I thought I would enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! The movie was a real torture to see. The idea has potential ... but movies go too much to wish for, and just about everyone who sees this movie is left with the impression that he could do better. I do not want to suggest whether to watch this movie or not. Chances are if you read these pages that you have already seen it or that you will see it - but be prepared for very poor 102 minutes.
