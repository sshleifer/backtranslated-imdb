AKA: Mondays in the sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just looked at. Three men wandering aimlessly and drinking, growing over everything and at all in their path. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is is a total waste of movies, without a single redeeming quality. <br /> <br /> I've read reviews that perform this show as "wonderful" and "heroic." "I'm afraid I can't accept unless these men come out as the stupidest most ignorant proto-people ever went. <br /> <br /> All in all, this wasn't a movie. Walk all the way through and lose everyone, but the audience. I've seen this three times, and can't see for my life what anyone sees in this waste.
