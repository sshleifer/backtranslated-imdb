It is hard to praise this movie very much. The CGI for the dragon was well finished, but lacked proper modeling for light and shade. Also the same recording is used infinitely by the dragon, which stumps through corridors that become a bit dull. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the actors and wondered what a former Emperor of Roman Empire was doing in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg" it must be an alias and you can blame him for using one if he looks like this stink. The story may have been interesting, but the play is flat and the direction is boring. If you are going to watch this movie, go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing it - then it'll be fun.
