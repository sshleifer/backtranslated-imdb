Surely no Saturday morning tv kids show was ever made this bad. After all, the producers had to expect the audience to come back. Well, in this terrible offer they could at least count the money they save on sets. The manuscript could have been a rejection from some much-forgotten space opera series, with a few smart lines added to the cooling-Gerald Mohr to mumble to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a luney story, so the action just plods boring together. Spacecraft props are absurd - a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example - but the planets must be some of the worst in film history. Most are red drawings, and everything is bathed in an often flawed red light. Even Mohr's bare hair is used as a plug. And it's a bad - like rib-thin as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and will probably agree!
