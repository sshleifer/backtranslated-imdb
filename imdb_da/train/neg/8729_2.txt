This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions around, but which are confused and inconsistent in the performance. Garcia stars like John Berlin, a forensic detective researcher who has moved to a small California town on behalf of a friend of his on the force there. He soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unresolved murder leading to his theorization of the existence of a serial killer that no one else believes in. The known victim is theorized to be blind, leading to a romance with a blind girl - thought to be a witness - in a nearby blind school. Despite a basically exciting story, there were too many quantum leaps and plots in this movie, where I found myself wondering how the hell did we get up here? or "how did we find this?" I found it confusing and inconsistent, despite the good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part towards the end as a F.B.I. investigating to get to Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
