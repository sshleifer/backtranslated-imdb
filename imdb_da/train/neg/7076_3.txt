Race drivers say 100 km / h works fast until you have driven 150, and 150 mph works fast until you have driven 250. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog seems breathtaking bizarre until you've seen Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre until you've seen the Begotten. <br /> <br /> And the Begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre until you've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Race fans, there is nothing in the whole world of movies like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Alabama's Ghost comes as close as any of his films to a coherent plot, involving only hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants, and mystery gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, cruising Sunset District in San Francisco, of course. What is truly spectacular is that someone gave him a lot of money to make Alabama's Ghost. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow it still does Alabama's Ghost. You see something terrible cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least part of the unusual is excusable on the grounds that they obviously made the movie from the main room on their Discover card. But Alabama's Ghost was made with an actual budget and it is a pity. I mean, I have a script about a tribal cannibal living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods out of Twizzlers, and no one knocking down my door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the money for Four of the flakest movies ever made?
