POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Spy Who Shagged Me is a highly overrated and over-hyped successor. The International Master of Mystery came straight out of the blue. It was a lonely star that few people had heard of. But it was amazingly original, had sophisticated humor and ample humor, always kept in good taste and had a brilliant cast. Spy Who Shagged Me was much more commercially announced and hyped about. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a lot of fun, but it is only after watching it two or three times that you see all the errors. The action was okay, but Heather Graham can't act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing, and she wasn't as good as Liz Hurley was in the first. The characters that bloomed in the first (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown into the background, hear and do not get many free-standing scenes. The movie is simply overrun with cameos. <br /> <br /> I especially hated the way they completely ignored some of the scenes in IMOM. When they were killed by Vanessa at the start, Basil had made himself known that she was a fembot all the time. What was the meaning of that? They killed number 2 in the first, and now they bring him back without any explanation. This should be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the movie. It just goes on a track further and further away from the point. The new characters are very unwelcome. The entire Mini-Me `makes fun of my size 'joke gets old very fast. Fat Bastard is just a bad excuse for gross humor. In total, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this was the first movie in the series, I'd probably be easier on it. But the series began on a note of dry white and then fell to a level of gross humor. So I say only watch this movie if you haven't seen its predecessor because The Spy Who Shagged Me is an ultimate disappointment.
