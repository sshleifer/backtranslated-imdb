I wish I could say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is common in every way. It has the stupid man, his smarter but boring and conventional wife, along with the idiotic sidekick for "comic" relief - it needs a lot. Old predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the laught racket, draw this unpleasantly imaginative plot lines of this harmful mental drug to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep similar to an induced coma. But it can be for a while, but because it gives the average American a character they can really identify. An "ordinary" guy like you and me. I live in the southern United States, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism.Down here is the unpleasant character everywhere, in some form. Watching him on TV is brutal overkill.
