For such a great classic tale, the setting (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I owe the script, which completely lacked dramatic excitement. The title of the club story is useful and would have given a new impetus to the literary classic. For some strange reasons, the box was dropped early. Knowing this was shot for 21 days says to me, "hurried" and it shows unfortunately. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I say on FX, I can tolerate really crappy CGI, but the script should rock and this was just too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I would blame it on the actors, but ... since I am writing more than acting, I choose my colleague.
