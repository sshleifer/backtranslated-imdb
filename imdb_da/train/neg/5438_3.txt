I am quite a fan of author / writer Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a fantastic film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize some years back, and he had a hand in the "Spider Man 2" script, undoubtedly the greatest cartoon film all the time. <br /> <br/> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed amazing comedic pieces, such as gut-busting "Dodgeball" and the genius short movie series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with a throw, including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, it looks like a no-brainer. <br /> <br /> It is. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein, the son of a mobster (Nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works a minimum wage at Bog Barn, has a distorted relationship with his boyfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), who make little more than ample amounts of sex without any plans other than tearing away in a career for which he has zero passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, a former roommate, Jon, introduces Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. Later that night they go out in pie and she asks Jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence: "I want you to tell me something you've never told a single soul. If you do, it will make this evening indelible. "Jon tells her a reverse dream about him, wandering around the city looking at strange faces that pass him by, but none of them sees him in the eye. "I imagine it must be what death feels," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, John's wild boyfriend, Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps Jon from work and takes him to a hulking abandoned steelworks, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane spend a vigilant moment together to visit punk rock concerts, doing drugs and drink lots of alcohol. This is not good with Phlox, who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship, namely letting her meet her new friends and his father. The film then tries to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off the hangers imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his dead-time work, as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem getting us to follow Jon through the movie: He's totally uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He goes through life as the invisible wraith, he described to Jane the night they met. It's not a problem at first. But he never becomes more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He simply follows the Bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never even gives anything about what he cares about or wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and do something other than partying, having sex and arguing. In other words, much ado about nothing. What we have here is the superficial skin of a good movie without anything on the inside. Sweeping filmography, ponderous voice-over with characters staring in the distance, lots of sex scenes both straight and homosexual, big arguments, more angry sex, a hunting scene and a tragic death ... but it doesn't seem to be anything. Ironically, at one point, Jane asks that he be confused by a number of Jon's pointless actions, asking him, "What happens, Jon? What is this about?" Yes, Jon, tell it. We in the audience are also dying. <br /> <br /> The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" should refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional stand-ins for the real people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them tick. We see them doing many things, but we do not know why. And the absence of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
