I only consider this movie as 3 out of sin because it tries to be worth it. I love to praise a big movie and I'm not biased toward "male" movies. Legally blonde was a great movie. Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of film making at worst. at the end of the movie i didn't care who was lying or if something was resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good story. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is deep, doesn't mean history is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for the change in the movie. In the Georgia Rule, the sign changes were sudden and undeveloped. Second, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Drawing a really good dynamic character is a hard work and takes time (you have only a few hours in a movie). This means that too many attempts at dynamic characters will receive too little attention to their personal change. Although I ignore the badly written story and the litter with weak dynamic characters, I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That's fine if you write American Beauty, but not when you try a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for a human (no, I don't preach her any laughter because she was infected, arguing for everyone, and we are all responsible for our own actions). "Dudley Do Right" Mormon Kid should have had the courage not to compromise on his religion and obligations ... and Simon, I seriously mean what kind of guy lets a 17-year-old girl who has been clouded just stay occasionally ( unless he is an actor or politician). This movie is worth seeing if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is not!
