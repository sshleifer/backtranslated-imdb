This movie is a huge steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version should redone, even why Striesand would have been a first star choice. <br /> <br /> For that matter, I have no idea why our people (homosexuals) tend to regard Striesand as a kind of treasure. At least, in my opinion, she had topped professionally with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic, or even the original (a nice movie in itself), but please, please, skip this stink pot!
