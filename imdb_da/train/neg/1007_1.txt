I found it very difficult to see this after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it in disgust and seeing Monster House instead (which, by the way, is fun). The story has massive holes in it. The baseline is vastly over stated and boring, the play is terrible, especially from Justin TImberlake, who really should stick to what he is good at (see daft and sing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he was dancing around to rock music without apparent reason halfway through the movie after him and Timberlake meet. Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to have some sort of father / son relationship of some sort or something, which is not at all clear except the fact that; Although Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for Timberlak's ignorant and rather stupid character, he nevertheless draws everything to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It would take some incredible breach of disbelief to give credit to history, which is simply absurd and blown out of proportion. Don't look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
