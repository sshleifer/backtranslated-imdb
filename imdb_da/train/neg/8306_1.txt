ET's occupation with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, she most likely grows psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now poor little rich girl Ashley Olson will be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became an outlet and said "I want to be alone". How much does one of this little girl do? Does ET have anything better to report on? I bet there are lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of these lawsuits over the will and her legacy. Who pays for Lifestyle Larry, Howard and Little Dannielynn? Could it be ET?
