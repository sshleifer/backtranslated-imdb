This film was a long build without climax. People who refer to the sword bird eventually as large must either be out of their mind or have no one. Too often, this film became soft. I'm not saying soft films are bad. But no matter how happy you are with sugar, it should not have room on a T-bone steak. This film was about revenge for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a small bar-fight. And there was only one of those who actually knew what a sword was; Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" without knowing how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a disgrace. As a drama, this movie had periods, but the best performance in it should go to Scotland's nature. This is a bit of breath that is not referred to as "soap" in my book.
