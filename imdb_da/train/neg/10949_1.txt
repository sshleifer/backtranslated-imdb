I go to the cinema to be entertained. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this movie. From the beginning to the end, there is no respite from the gray, abrasive reality of this woman's life. It's fast-paced, with no change of mood. I was only to the end because I was convinced that things should get better. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one as evidenced by the many strangles that rang around the cinema when the film mercifully brought to a close. Honest depiction of social depravation is no crime, but boring your audience to groan is not the way to win public sympathy. A horrible movie.
