I wrote a few notes here at FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell party ... <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently accused of beating his wife and can Make time in prison. I just hope he can find the Armani jail suit to go in the style of: One of the guilty pleasures in this movie is to watch his police detective dressed in $ 4,500 designer coats, a $ 7300 designer silk and watch his $ 3500 / month Los Angeles bachelor pad loft with decor of Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The leading lady Tracey Phillips has beautiful porcelain skin, floating red hair that always looks styled even when the mussed and amazing breasts are loud in the second half of the film of a designer silk pullover, who unfortunately remains in place over her torso, even when she was ready to be sacrificed to Satan. At least back in the 1970s, our demonic killers stripped their victims before they renounced them, even though there is something to be said of having a little behind the imagination. In the last 10 minutes of the movie I could just think of what her breasts would probably look like. 3) Professional psychics living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide he was roughing it. In fact, the condominium used in this movie is similar to the one seen in David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR., Which at least had the good sense of making it the occasion resident of a successful film director. The only professional psychic I have encountered outside of this movie is all currently serving imprisonment for fraud. 4) I forget his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his "How does the" Buddy Boy? "Line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since" THANKS TO THE RIDE, LADY !! "from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) In the big cities there are huge boxes of simmering acid that explode into large fireballs if someone throws a lit Zippo lighter into them, so large public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered over Of course, even though the idea of ​​smoking around is dangerous is preposterous, and since Zippo lighters need to be filled manually with lighter fluid, which can often leak out and be absorbed by their clothes, the idea of ​​a pocket load on your $ 7300 seems Gucci silk wear to be much more dangerous. <Br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things to see it is to stay even that you do not see computer-assisted special effects, but the actual stuntpeople risk life and limbs contributing to a movie that earned almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when released. <br /> <br /> 7) Movie Satanists always marvel at me: Here is a guy who has tapped into any Luciferian bid for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful as making himself rich or cause fashion models to engage in free form sex with him; instead, he holds bag ladies and make them live outside people's apartments. Talking about where here is a guy who is indestructible, can fly and is able to get into the bodies of others - yet he commits the star Lou Diamond Phillips with a regular fistfight in the movie's conclusion, but doesn't have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And over and over ... To be seen in the company of wise crushing friends while using beer. You want to have fun as long as you constantly refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
