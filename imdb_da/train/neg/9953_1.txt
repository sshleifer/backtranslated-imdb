I really have to watch a good movie soon, because it appears every other entry or it's something I despise. But my story speaks, I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. I never thought I would see a movie as thunderous as it did. Al Pacino does not work in this movie: he poses. There are many, many scenes of his character, which are a race car driver, just staring at the camera. He's absolutely horrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two must be in a love affair, and there is simply no chemistry at all. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of genius behind Tootsie here. Is it the same man I cheered for in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Drive, don't go away from Bobby Deerfield.
