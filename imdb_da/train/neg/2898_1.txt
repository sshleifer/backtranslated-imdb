Wowwwwww, an hour ago I finally ended up seeing this horrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off within the first 10 minutes, but I figured I'd give it a try because it had just been getting better. Or at least have some redeeming features that I expected at least it would be a make you think movies, or as really intelligent or very well filmed or something ... That was obviously not the case and I wasted around an hour and a half in my life. I'm not even going to get into why it's terrible because it's a waste of time to explain that this "may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down on spoiler stuff and pay more attention to ensure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved in some way in the movie or anything else. I thought it would be humorous for this horrible movie to see how bad the rating would be, and I was very much shocked to see the rather high ratings ... all reviews with approx. 7-10 stars must be clear about some completely different movies ... I'm still a big IMDb fan, but are seriously looking into this assessment process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee as a 3.
