Look, I'm sorry if half of the world violates this, but life is confusing enough. I don't have to see it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, great time. I even saw Fracture, and I knew it would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well shot, and it is not bold - though it is artistic. Well-produced movies have reasons for cuts and quick edits, not this "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation" excuse. This thing will hurt your head. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you anywhere. I still love AH and I will always give him a chance, but if you don't have time to see bad ideas on the screen, skip this one.
