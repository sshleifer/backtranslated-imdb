I only watched DVD 1. The program can have 10 minutes of good information; Otherwise, there are snotty setdowns of religious people. It is as if director Brian Flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels with these tools that he can easily bludge his resistance. <br /> <br /> Also Flemming migrates to a large extent into his own personal problems and they take over movies. It never comes back to the subject. Religious people tend to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in violent upbringing. Arguments from such victims seem irrational and therefore not convincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people want more data. We do not need to know that religious people are naked, but more than American Jews should tell how annoying Christmas music gets in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, superintendent Fleming childhood school teacher confronts the direct insight of the instructor with his motives. It seems to be the most honest part of the movie and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little more self-conscious, he could have a good story about himself (past and present) relationship with Christianity and the violent institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. <br /> <br /> And perhaps he could borrow his "Christ never gone to earth" material for a more serious documentary. I am not studying Saul / Paul's writings to find out how airtight it is, but a quick review of Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interviews are pretty good, they do not greatly enhance Fleming's dissertation. Sam Harris is a good advocate of the anti-religious POV, and he does not shine on the other, non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easy Google'd) interviews at Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
