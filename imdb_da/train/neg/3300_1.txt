Very typical of Swedish films of this type. Nice that the play was so bad, these actors usually give a good show. The molding was poorly finished, it made you expect something (I won't tell you what). The protagonist was horrible ... I don't know where to find her. In any case, stay away from this and go see "The Third Wave" instead, this is Swedish action in its prime.
