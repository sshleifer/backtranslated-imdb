... but a miserable movie. As Maltin says, this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... too serious! The reason is stupid and slow (something about old people who are in the bodies of toddlers in order to obtain immortality) ... The film is all speech conversations Speaking speech Talking about the same things over and over again. I actually deaf a couple of times! The movie is sooo boring! They threw sleep walks through this with the only exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but it was probably a love work for both parties (they often complained that horror movies were too violent ... yes it has no violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will put you to bed!
