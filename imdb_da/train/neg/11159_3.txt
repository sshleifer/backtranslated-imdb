I watched this movie on a "snap preview" and I must honestly admit that I don't like movies with Meryl Streep so much. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the break halfway through the film. I couldn't blame them if it wasn't a true story, there would have been no need for the other half of the picture. Just before the film progresses in time in ten years, I myself expected the credits to appear.
