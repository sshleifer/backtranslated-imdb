I will be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with a room temperature IQ. Sorry liberals, feminists, etc. No women ever become a seal. They can also forget about the draft or be in battle. It will not happen. You look hard as it is to understand or accept that men and women are physically different. Regardless of whether it is 2007, reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid harming their feelings. Men can't feed or breastfeed babies (Oh-I forgot San Franfreako). Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a fight or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Finally, I couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what I just wrote disturbs you. Come to think of it - if it disturbs you who only warms my heart more. I did not write a thing that was not the truth. This imbecile film is nothing but a comedy and a misery in it.
