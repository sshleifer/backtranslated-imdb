Back in 1985, I caught this thing (I can't even call it a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were out of control. I figured out early that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women), bad action (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but even he was bored after 30 minutes. Remember - this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! This was back before nudity was so easy to get to through the internet and such. We kept an eye on something interesting or fun, but it never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign where the studio admitted this movie was crap! (A poster had a fictional review saying, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed some talent and has actually moved on to a career in the company. No budget and boring t & a. Skip it.
