Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger, where he finally managed to kill almost all the youth in Springwood; Now he wants to expand his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do so. <br /> <br /> A mistake like a horror movie, because it simply isn't scary at all. Works better as a dark, macabre black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been cut off from all his ability to chill this viewer. (For many wisecracks, that's for sure.) The actors are not interesting (save Robert Englund as always and an obviously dormant Yaphet Kotto), and there are simply too many visual effects. The final is OK, but doesn't give as many sparks as I think you could hope for. <br /> <br /> In the addition of a new twist to the well-known dream-daughter's story, Englund allows for more non-makeup scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> There are cameos worth noting: a common cameo by da-pair Roseanne and Tom Arnold who lack the entertainment value, an appropriate look of veteran chef Alice Cooper and a fun como by Johnny Depp who also recognizes the pop icon that he has become. <br /> <br /> Film debut by Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the playing of key scenes from past entries under final credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
