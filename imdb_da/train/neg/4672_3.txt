This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a good job as the ruthless father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is for the jump as a daughter and is nothing no matter what Olivia De Havilland's much more nuanced, mature rendition in The Heiress (1949) has. The film's feminist inclined conclusion also goes against the strict conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, parodyed feministly in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
