It makes you strange how this show is still in the air. There have been a couple who have been together, married and have children, but everyone else has broken up. What is the point of continuing this? The show can be entertaining in the beginning. You see all the girls swimming over a man that almost all of them like the same. It's like in real life! The girls start taking sides, bitching each other out and showing their true self (or we think). But one man is left to decide who should choose that he believes he can marry and live happily ever. What is true love exactly? How can you fall for someone when you are forced to choose them? This show is incredible. You thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on TV to find love? It's not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when he goes out with others and goes out with them? None of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know that there will be no good end in the future. For everything we know, everything is written.
