If it wasn't for some immature happy idiots, I know that I insist on seeing this "documentary", I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad scripting and ridiculous moments. One in particular is where Afghan policemen / soldiers arrest Don Larson to film the streets while allowing the cameraman to continue recording his arrest and then drive away, still filming, presumably to his plush hotel. Then there is the scene where a car crashes into another car that has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without proof that it is in a collapse or an explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised this currently has the rating it has (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users had more meaning.
