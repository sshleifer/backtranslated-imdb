OKAY. So it's a low budget "movie" (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The action is universally horrible, the makeup is ridiculous (the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams and I have seen more compelling bruises made of halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they used a person's borrowed Toyota pickup for to shine headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I might forgive these low budget moves if there was any actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of video recordings boasts no plot, no real character and no momentum. It is an independent mess. <br /> <br /> Don't worry - no spoilers here because there's absolutely nothing to spoil.
