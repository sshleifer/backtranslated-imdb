1. watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70's assumed horror flicks as Friday the 13th (versions 1 for anything ??). I can't think of very redeeming here except (or can I think of something?)? The story is about a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program a year after some children were beaten in the woods as a "tribute" to this, supposedly. But see and see, one of the stupid people has connections to the event itself, because her sister was one of those murdered (again, how stupid is this that she herself would be part of this). Guess what? The murderer is on it again, and we are tipped off from the beginning who it is (so some mystery goes at all). And besides all this, where is the 'police' and why does anyone not call them. I can't believe this movie was funded by anyone and made. You would think that the American people would now be judged a little higher, at least in their movie experience, but not in this movie maker.
