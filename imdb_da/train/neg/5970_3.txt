Coyote Ugly could have been much more effective if the filmmakers had made it an R-rated guilty pleasure / exploitation movie (with lots of nudity.) But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios feel like these days, We end up with a movie like this: a PG-13 "toes" flick that must not go anywhere near as far as the movie should have gone. <br /> <br /> The script is generic, it is easy to guess what plot point will happen 15 minutes before it actually happens. The action is sufficient, but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing could be done with them. There were also many points where it seemed that I saw a music video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The film's only assets are the incredibly beautiful female leads. We'll see them in some extremely tight and beautifully revealing outfits ..... but only so much could be shown because of the PG-13 restrictions. There are lots of cleavage and tinted body parts that make some well-choreographed dance numbers, but there is no nudity or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (she is becoming increasingly insane with age) is also in the movie for a very short time. Sexy beginner Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and she has a killing smile) and shows some real action potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see this movie appeal to are pre-pubescent boys who are not allowed to watch R-rated movies yet. The audience can get a lot out of it from a title aspect, but adult audiences will be annoyed and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: The movie-1 the women-10
