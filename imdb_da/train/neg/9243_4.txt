To put it simply, I'm not happy with Westerners. And I've never been through one from the beginning to the end, and I decided to see "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the way, no matter how painful it was to me. At first, it was scary as expected. I found the actor to be ridiculous, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing endures on the edge of painful. But after mental pep, I talk about fighting, after the first 20 minutes it began to be easier for me to endure. Focusing on movies and how John Ford managed to do even the stupid situations (boring according to me it is) looks quite amazing at times, made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can't go as far as saying I enjoyed the movie at the end of it. But it was done well enough that I could sit all the way to the end and it moves me in itself.
