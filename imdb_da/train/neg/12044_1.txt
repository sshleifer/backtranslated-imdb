Went to watch the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not homosexuals. EVER. This was clearly established immediately at the start of the movie and amplified every five minutes or so thereafter. So it's safe for American dudes to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked beautiful in all her short comedies, which although many were probably all filmed the same day, one after another, with the director saying, "Okay, now look beautiful ... well ... OK now look scared ... well ... now look depressed ... well ... now look interested ... well ... now look beautiful again ... well ... "<br /> <br /> Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents could not act. Trojans looked like the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not flash on camera. <br /> <br /> Helen's biggest line was, "They come to me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music was remarkable as modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitts thighs go all the way. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a young man with whom he was very close, but that's okay. They were cousins. Never mind the story. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story with an expression. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Trojan gods had all Greek names, but their statues looked either Egyptian or as Peter O'Toole in a row. Greek men never touched each other unless they fought like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color ... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor. Troy had only three women. There were many blonde Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise be really stuck. <br /> <br /> Despite their coastal desert landscape, the Greeks had the eerie ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, burial mounds, Trojan horses, and the like. br /> British actors look stupid with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt only changes expressions when the sun shines directly in his eyes. Greek soldiers struggled constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers had underwear under their skirts. Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new.
