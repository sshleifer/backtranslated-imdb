Has anyone read the script. This should be some of the worst writing and management of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn't pull it out. Ca. two-thirds it looked like Giamatti's eyes said, I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the really really bad Christmas environment list. Not enough lines, but what more can you say? Okay, the movie doesn't just move with Vaughn's conversation dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy you just can't get past. It was just a noisy walk through that no one seemed to be able to enter.
