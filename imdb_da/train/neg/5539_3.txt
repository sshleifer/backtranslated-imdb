Wimpy filled shirt Armand Louque (mixed game of veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of scientists who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval (pick up blonde Dorothy Stone) who uses the soft sap to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopeless tree Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious about being used and asked by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well, that's not safe. Initially, Victor Halperin's static (non) direction of the uneven and unintentional talk-ridden story lets plod together with a tremendously slow pace. Worse yet, Halperin fails to bring any excitement, atmosphere, and momentum to the terrible boring act. Most blah that works from a virtually motionless roll does not help with anything; only George Cleveland as the cordial General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manages to experience things a little with their welcoming and refreshing hammy histrionics. The drippy stock movie library scores, the painfully obvious stagebound sets, and the raw cinematography are also quite miserable and unimpressive too. In fact, this weak excuse for a scarecrow is so curved that not even the unredited strong staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can relieve brain-boring boredom. A dismally boring dud.
