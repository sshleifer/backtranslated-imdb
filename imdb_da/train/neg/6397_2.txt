It's a problem I have with movies that come on TV when there is nothing else to see. I'm somehow sucked into really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was pretty clear. The concept of being the only ones left on the ground after a comet, so finding out zombies is around makes me laugh. And so I gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that way it makes you laugh (too stupid> fun). I think I only saw it because the guy from Star Trek was the lead. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and yet he was the only fun character.
