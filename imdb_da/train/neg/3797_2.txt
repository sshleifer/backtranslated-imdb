Years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled on the horrible plot that meant replacing people with machines, but since then, a war has arisen between cyborgs and humans, and we lost, now is a super-wife who is the daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (she inherits only half of her minimal-effect ability), which I think is the film's minimal connection to the first, but when the superwoman is created, she hides in 1980, while a bounty hunts from the future chase her down in this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cool hit that I can see why people liked, even though I wasn't a fan of that movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and give lots of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have the ambition, it is a cheap rip off The Terminator with a muscular woman who is so low on acting as she does, Olivier Gruner seems like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scale that was the most important point of sale of the original. I admit that I was not a fan of the original, but it deserved a better follow-up than this. The original also featured a good cast like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley, one has none and this time it's just a boring movie with a pretentious mood. In fact, after I saw this, it inspired adding a half star to the original. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
