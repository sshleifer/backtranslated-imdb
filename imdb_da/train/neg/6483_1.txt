It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped, and the only personality was from the memories I had from the previous film, which was in contrast to the "new" personalities (or lack thereof). I seriously thought that the opening scene was a nightmare by Ariel because of how absurd it was. It was serious. It reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney Channel. Everyone is hyperactive, and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any real connection. The most disappointing part was the horrible songs - not captivating, not amazing. In the original Ariel had a fantastic and powerful voice and the whole song is captivating and fun. You remember them and will sing them. But the songs in this movie were not creative at least; It's as if they are talking in an annoying song-song voice - quite weak, disappointing. I don't have what I want to sing to those who feel like you usually come from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's like you wouldn't make the movie so they hardly made any effort. . . this movie would need a new story line, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying "look at me! look at me! I'm so annoying!" mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
