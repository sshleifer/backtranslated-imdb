I was one of the "few Americans" who grew up with all of Gerry Andersen's wonderful creations. Thunderbirds were a great series at the moment and would have made a great action / adventure movie if only the authors could have figured out where to target it. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a drum, but I didn't expect it to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, this could have been both visually stunning and exciting. It should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... to save people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were also thrown young at the original). The breakout section was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didn't care about the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed Thunderbird's more to the high technology than the stories, and even that wasn't enough time to cut as far as I was concerned. I would have liked to see more cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then I'm just a big kid ...;)
