Being an independent filmmaker and a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this documentary that believed that this would finally put the record right on how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing, self-centered, conflicting, and conflicting collection of bitterly self-destructive habits. <br /> <br /> When people remember Ed Wood Jr., do people actually remember the other cousin of the guy with duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It looks like the very first moment there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood, these people come out of the "Wood" work! Only to take significant ghosts on someone who actually gave them a chance since no one else wanted! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people get rid of that they didn't get the $ 75 they were promised! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In fact, it was ALL he lived for. You can giggle when you see Ed's movie, but somehow you realize you're laughing at him and not at him. <br /> <br /> But I hand over ... Back to the movie at hand. If you expect a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you won't get it here. If you want a movie about cranky bitter old actors, this is the movie for you!
