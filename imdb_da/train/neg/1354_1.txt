I watched his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know one or two things about movies. And Crispin Glover's movie is outrageous. He basically exploits the mentally challenged. Not only is the Shirly Temple that the antichrist (who I admit is a little fun) tells it mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors, who are as they are all mentally challenged. PETA and human rights should be above all this. It's not 'counterculture' that Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.
