About three minutes into this thing, I quickly started sending, pausing only under nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes I was finished and I wish I could get my money back from the rental shop. The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by MPAA. Come on authors - the evil guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That is how it has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! To add disgrace to injury, the "twist" at the end was so formal that it could have come from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he had to concentrate on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - drive away! Run away!
