I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another of his movies, so when I saw $ 5.50 in Walmart's protocol I bought it. Although it is mildly fun, the movie does not really hit a step. Some scenes like a party scene in a bar go just too long and really have no meaning. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the movie that gives the whole movie a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some 60's burnout special! <br /> <br /> Finally, although I'm happy to have another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!
