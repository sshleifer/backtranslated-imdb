I'm not sure if users should be allowed to browse movies after just sitting through half, but I'm afraid I just couldn't wait for a moment. <br /> <br /> If this unnecessary excuse for a movie doesn't, I have the late, big GP that spins like a wheel in his grave, so I doubt anything. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above 'Not a movie for Parsons fans' summarizes most of my feelings. How dare a (second rate) instructor and writer try something that they clearly cannot deliver. What did they think? Where to start? <br /> <br /> WRITING: I thought I'd get a piece of bittersweet Americana. What I got was poorly executed slapstick with no clich√© left draw. Stupid hippy? Check. Stupid fat policeman? Check. Terrible plot contrivances? Check. Terribly written female characters? Double check. Total Override of the Story That You Are Trying to Describe? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that what you see is a soap and not a very well written one. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with Ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville that hasn't moved much. Scene with ex girlfriend, who was a bit like the last. And so on ... DIRECTIONS: My friends and I decided, after some consideration, to see this was like seeing a bad episode of Quincy, or perhaps a particularly bad duke of Hazzard. It was so bad that the direction was. Terrible cuts, horrible camera work, lumpy ins and outs to scenes. God, it was cringeworthy. And then I discovered that the director was an Irish that is most remarkable. Recent work is a really miserable BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen (believe me it's the lowest common denominator TV). And then it was quite sensible ... ACTIVE: Are we so critical now that when some random guy from the TV decides to make a move if he's not that bad, does he stink, we welcome his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT ready to get through all the scenes. Poor Christina A. has no luck. Her performance is a car accident (although what you do with these lines, I don't know). The 'hippy' in the elevator: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Haven't we moved since Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get my drive. What I want to say is what other reviews have mentioned, no one on this movie clearly gives a flyer for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They didn't know anything about the American roadmap, and they certainly give a curse about trying to do something with a pretty decent story from rock mythology. This movie was shallow, failed to explore, and the jaw dropped the unfunny from the beginning to ... oh wait, I didn't quite end. And I suggest staying away too.
