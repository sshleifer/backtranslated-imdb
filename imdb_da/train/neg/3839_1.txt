Some movies are so bad they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this movie was just as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The action was horrible, the direction was poor and it traveled too quickly. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and finish and go home. <br /> <br /> Nor did Melissa Joan Hart beat me as a talented actress, but then every movie she made was pretty low budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lets down her characters by hammering them too much and talking too fast as if speeding up her words should make her more dramatic. She really brings out the feeling that there is a crew in front of her, and she talks to a camera as she has to engage the viewer in her character. It basically lets the whole movie down, and any bone it may have left on is destroyed. It's probably the only good thing about the movie when she was nailed at the end. But even that was not satisfactory enough to suppress my disgust for such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in film is softer than a piece of dry toast.
