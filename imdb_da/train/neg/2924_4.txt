There was something here with the female leader who has this perfect life, she is always wanted for the worst life possible, beginning as a child prostitute and settled with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to rely on Dean Cain, and it ultimately destroys it. It sounds weird, but I like the post Dean Cain was at the end and the election he made. He cannot hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of his child (I think the time frame makes it clear that it is his child and not his brother), but at the same time he cannot forgive her for everything she is finished, sleeps with his brother (who shows the love and commitment he felt was basically a way) and then was part of his death. In better hands it would have been a better movie, but for something I caught on the sennate cable, it's not bad.
