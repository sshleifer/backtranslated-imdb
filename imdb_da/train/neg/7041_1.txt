What more can you say about this movie, except that it is absolutely horrible. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons to see this, but it is, but their talents are wasted in this junk. I think they used a double in some of Adam's scenes as when he is running because you can't see his face. if adam was embarrassed to be in zombie nightmares, just think of what he must have felt about appearing in this ?? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but still Zombie Nightmare is a classic (see Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and foremost) for this. The band is very annoying and overbearing by some of the actors.A rip-off of The Wild One starring Marlon Brando, of course.Tina looks fantastic though.I hope her and Adam got a good paycheck !! Pass by!
