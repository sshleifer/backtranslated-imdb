This was a blind purchase used DVD. It killed quite a good buzz I had gone when I hit the game. <br /> <br /> It's bubble head comedy, but that's about. tacky. The plot is ZANY! But the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently confronted that I eventually found it depressing to see. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the cashier can expect me more than an uneven, goofy caper movie. (I know I know the quotes on the box and nomination of the Academy Award mean nothing.)
