The film, a universal release of a Protelco MLC production, is a tedious tale of the theory of breaking down an object's molecular structure, capturing it in a cell as "clean energy" and then sending it back completely to a "target area." is no explanation why it is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pockmocked actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") thinks it is something to dedicate his and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell Ronald Allen), live to. <br /> <br /> During an experiment before the noted Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz) fails his machine because of sabotage, so he himself "projected" by his secretary Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to seek revenge . Of course she screws up and he comes out and looks like a "pork" with the power to electrolyze people. <br /> <br /> With this newly created machine, he manages to zap some Cockney idiots, a security man named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his lab manager, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> Finally, the clown destroys his equipment and himself, though Hill and Mitchell's attempt to help him. On the whole, a completely meaningless movie without any message at all. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color films you'll ever see.
