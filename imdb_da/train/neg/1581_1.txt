This was a waste of 75 minutes in my life. The play was horrible and the plot was ridiculous. It's about an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then detests them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA who causes problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbians happen to seduce this guy's wife too! Meanwhile, the evil lesbian girlfriend doesn't really love her to sleep. It ends in a happy end where everything is forgiven. The women are also very naked, mainly in situations that stretch reality. bad bad.
