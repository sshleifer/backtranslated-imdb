While William Shater can always make me smile in something he looks like (and I especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is about glitz and dancing girls and screams and jumps up and down. <Br /> <br /> It has none of Millionaire's intelligence, none of the flair of the Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is about dancing and stupid things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> Of course, I just saw it to check it out. I saw it for over 45 minutes, so I had to extinguish it. <br /> <br /> The best part of it was William Shatner dancing on stage. He is a hoot !!! Unfortunately, this show will NOT do it. <br /> <br /> It's a given
