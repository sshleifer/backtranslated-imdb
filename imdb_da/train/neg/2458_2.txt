I can't describe how horrible this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds the way his animated totaly disgusting? The Men of Rohan looks 100% fake with their badly colored hair that doesn't even come close to matching what the actors look like. The orcs look awful. Why does gandalf go bad? Why can't they say things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others who sounded like terrible pronunciation * of Tolkien's characters. All in all, I'm happy that the studio, which made this pull out the sequal, was just a terribly horrible adaptaion. Go see the hobbit comic for a better cartoon of Tolkien's work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2.10
