And that's all there is. This thing is slow. The actors have the skills, they do not seem to be motivated to put the effort into action. The reason is not so great and is further hampered by the aforementioned slowness of everything. The centers, when any, are British. Uh, many of these people must be Danes. Ok, ok, accents are not that important. But language is. I don't think they used words like "yes" and "OK" in Beowulf's day. And the presumably cool weapon his king gave him? Did he ever reload that thing? Has he ever seen it? Or was Beowulf just as bad a goal? Well, his goal matched at least the computer graphics used to generate monsters. It was also a little away. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Just one I can think of. Marina Sirtis has kept up well over the years.
