It was pointed out in a now deleted post from another IMDb user that anyone who had to see "The Medusa Touch" must be warned about a scene that is honest, reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But I hope that anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree, producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan produced the Oscar-nominated "LA Confidential" and writer John Briley won an Oscar for "Gandhi" and an international cast I found "The Medusa Touch" to be a heavy-handed, unintentional laughing rebellion. It was a badly directed, horribly written and acted mess. It tried to capitalize on the genre of the 70's telekinetic thriller. The movie fails many times. Please consider "Carrie" and the undervalued "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two entertaining and exciting thrillers who dealt with the same subject.
