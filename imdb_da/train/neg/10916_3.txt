For home users, I can see how they would welcome this movie. For outsiders without interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction. How a young woman could 'love' lieutenant from just glinting him was nonsense. How she could, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never marry just because of this horror was beyond me. I mentioned the Germans portrayed as idiots, and it was exemplified in the hunt for the bog. Several hundred German troops advanced and pushed the Russians into the bog. Then the Russians hid, and the Germans stopped at the bog and stood right there listening. I suppose they didn't want to get their boots wet, but I'm sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men in the water to search the bog. But it would have ended the story. The Germans also stepped into the barn, where the Russians hid in the ceiling and did not bother at all. At worst, a soldier would have thrown a grenade into the ceiling and not climbing a ladder to peer. <br /> <br /> I saw some reviewers who said they were crying at the end. I wonder why? You knew that this tiny band would be lost and they were nothing haunted in it.
