Must be one of the worst waste of 35mm movie films ever resolved on the public, the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo documentary "The Legend of Boggy Creek". Bad script, worse acting, etc. Etc. Dawn Wells had to hope Gilligan would save her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of trap.
