This is perhaps the fateful display of Santa Claus ever committed to any medium, whether it be a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa Claus looks like a pervert looking down on the kids and the winding story of bringing Merlin in to help him defeat one of Satan's minions, Pitch, doesn't make things better. It is ridiculous to say the least, with bad effects, even to 1959 standards. If a child were to watch this movie, he would have nightmares and would never have Santa Claus to visit. They would be scared for life. Imagine the child in "A Christmas Story" as they begin to scream after being put on Santa's lap. This will be the case if the child sees this movie.
