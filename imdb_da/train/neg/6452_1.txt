You know the story. Nice kids alone in the forest when BAM! Something starts to cut them up. Well, this is no different. A lot of kids return to a cabin where he leads twin brother disappeared for years before. The seed is a "UNKOWN CREATURE" star that cuts them up and their only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> Saying this movie was bad is an understatement; The acting was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very cheesy. And as all movies do these days, they try to get you with a twisting end as they don't! <br /> <br /> There is a bright spot for this movie - LOSSTAR Maggie Grace as the women's management.
