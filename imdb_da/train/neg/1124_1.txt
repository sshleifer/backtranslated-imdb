The opening shot was the best thing about this movie because it gave you the hope that you would see a passionate, well-made independent film. Damn who opens the shot to fill me with hope. As the "film" evolved slower, my thoughts were varied in relation to this "movie": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Should the actors pay the manager to be in this "movie"? Did I get my ticket validated at Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I watched this movie in the Theater! This would be the only exception I would make to watch a movie at home over a movie theater because at home you can turn it off. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Except that this "movie" went from trying to be a comedy to a family drama to a spiritual propaganda. None of these fronts succeeded. Oh, and my boyfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
