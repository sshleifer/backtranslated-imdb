The Underground Comedy Movie may be the worst train wagon I've ever seen. Fortunately, I didn't pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly went to see it again, as it was so horrible, but he had to prove to me how terrible it was. I love off color comedy. At least I figured it would have it and I would be entertained. No, instead, the play was so horrible that the "jokes" were extremely cheesy, and the plot was not where to find. Maybe it wasn't supposed to be a plot, so I can't hold it against this movie. It's pretty boring when the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman who has her head hit by a bat ..... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform with a flat bat. Hysterical fun. Simply genius. I got the feeling of watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. Maybe it was full of inside jokes, we just didn't understand. Or maybe it's the worst piece of waste ever made, and it must be locked away in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't Buy This Movie!
