This movie was horrible. In the beginning I just read the plot overview and it looked OK so I saw it. The action was horrible. It was like the actress was almost camera shy. everything seemed false. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite some years ago .. I've seen it at least 20 times .... the plot was also shed. The authors were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you're watching just to see how much the worst can get, so later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was. I think everyone should look at this, so then we could appreciate better other, real, movies.
