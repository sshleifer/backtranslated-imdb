Now I understand. The title refers to each target's immediate post-reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture. Too hard to be scary, lack of good dialogue, though any fear of that matter makes the Screaming Skull more like a snoring. Even so, the mansion and the property in black and white put a dark tone to the movie, but it's about it. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money from it! Remember the coffin guarantee at the beginning? It may be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. Sad thing is that viewers probably hoped that director Alex Nichol was forced into a coffin, nailed shut and buried alive for his lame efforts. Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrible situation really does not draw any sympathy that you will feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted cranial container. Also, her husband John comes out as a discouraging wannabe smooth talker, but it doesn't work and he ends up proving how hard he's about to turn a helpless curl around! Ah, Mickey ?? Days before you could get a restraining order against real estate specialists like him. This guy's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane. Still, Mickey, in spite of his strange persona, is the only good thing about this movie that gives a little sense of entertainment and I can't get enough of a guy who says "It was Mary!" and holds through pots in a greenhouse.
