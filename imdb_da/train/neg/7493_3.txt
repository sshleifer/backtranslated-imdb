I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts out very slowly, the background for the Nuremberg trials becomes clear step by step, the Germans have a fun English accent, but then suddenly the audience in the last few minutes from the first part of the series to see the most shocking, horrible footage I ever have seen. It is important that people see such recordings (although I absolutely do not agree with people who say there is no age where children can be exposed to this kind of material), but in this movie it was quite ridiculous . It was intended solely to improve the impact of a regular television series. It was supposed to shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move with well-documented scenes, inspirational dialogue or interesting point of view, the audience is tortured with horrible images of inmates of skin and bones. It does not show any respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
