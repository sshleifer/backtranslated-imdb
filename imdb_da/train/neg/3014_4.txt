I recently seen Produced Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was drawn to the film as a photographer because I am both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I think the film does a good job of getting that message across, I couldn't help feeling that it was made as a complete reflection on Burtynsky's photographs and subsequent popular book. Obviously, one reason for this is the widespread use of stills with zoom and pans across them. Although this is a good effect when used economically, I felt like 75% of the movie was just stills from Burtynsky's book (which I already own). It's probably an exaggeration, but I felt that way. If you own the book or are familiar with his work, you may be better off skipping this.
