This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever seen. It is horribly boring, I'd rather have put a seminar on creationism than I have seen this if I knew it would be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot bikini chick with the big take off this one by something lower than a 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews of this movie claim that this movie is "accidental fun" is absurd and just completely wrong. Not one thing is fun about this movie. they spend the first 50 or so minutes going through the woods talking about things you don't understand or care about, and it's just as lame when people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so INTERESTING. Really though, I didn't see it to the end, but it should say something terrible about it. FIRST MOVIE EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after exhausting this filth from my DVD player, I started scratching it against the cement in front of my house and not having other blockbuster customers have to fall into the same mistake I had made to rent this movie. Then Zach whipped his pants. Thank you for your time.
