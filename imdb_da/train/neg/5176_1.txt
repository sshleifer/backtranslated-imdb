When a movie is independent and not judged, such as Hamiltons, I waited out of the norm, cutting your heart's violence. I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews I visited the site and I even convinced a couple of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this god's horrible movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Dawson's Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this movie, but the little expectations were there for the movie to be shot to hell when I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood coming out of a person's finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much for the imagination. I'm not sorry to see Happy Feet. I think there could have been more violence and doing in that movie than in Hamiltons!
