'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit through, even in a lean 76 minutes; Something of this terribly boring and pretentious Euro horror trip, and I may have come into coma. <br /> <br /> Once again, Jess Franco delivers a truly horrible piece of 60's garbage that is apparently made of a cast and crew out of their head on Class A hallucinogenics, as no one second of this mess . Apparently this is one of the better of his 180+ movies ?? It is hard to believe that there are worse bets out there. <br /> <br /> The inevitable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M to a good end, yet it still manages to remain fun numbingly boring. <br /> <br /> I have to leave it a while before I entered the world of risky Euro Horror again ?? life is too short to be used to see bilge like this.
