Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore flick is worth a visit (at least once). Sleazy snapshotters escort wants to be actresses / models for a distant house in the forest to sexually destroy them. Unfortunately (for those boys), a long-running demon living in the forest has already targeted the girls for fun. The case ends up having fun with the boys - this is IF you are considering beheading, dismemberment and masturbation with cut limbs "fun". Once again, everything sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film. As Komizu lacked LIVING DEATH ON TOKYO BAY with its awkwardness, he also lacks this effort and is only rescued by some violent violence and some great white panties. <br /> <br /> Don't buy hype or you're going to be very disappointed.
