If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he can't handle himself so Scott takes him in. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with more homosexual references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "fight" and Scott tells Billy he is "still sore from last night". Among other. Wonderful catch phrases like "Shut sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut sh! T" will keep you laughing for hours. The native American boys playing Mexican gambling members are also top notch. As they say, it's "party time right now. Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba." I could go on forever but just watch this movie and laugh at your $$ off. It was so much fun, I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
