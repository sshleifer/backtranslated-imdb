I don't know why, but after all the hype on NPR I thought it was a new movie ..... all the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs. .. it has been repackaged with juicy narrative and over-dramatic music to Disney to exploit Earth's day - there are good moments and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, ... ..... James Earl Jones speaks, but I was hoping for a groundbreaking movie considering the new camera technology used to make this film ... it has been sanitized to a children's audience so you can actually see better footage for free on youtube .... I feel we are due to something like ground breaking like Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is definitely not that
