I thought this movie was pretty boring. If you are looking for cheesey, you like this. I, myself, didn't mind a fair amount of cheese, but it was ridiculous. The progression of the movie bored me and the story was very weak. The only thing that was entertaining about this movie was the daughters of the zombies, but even that is not enough to see this flick.
