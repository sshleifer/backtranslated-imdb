I went to this movie and expect a short film about the effect Sam Son had on society. I didn't think Spike Lee would force me to waste more on racial tension, mob justice, or the inability of the common citizen to choose under the pressure of peers. Lee has presented an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie could have been more effective if in a 90-min format with more focus, less tangential subplots. <br /> <br /> Don't even disturb the rental video unless you passionately enjoy Spike Lee; in that case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.
