Around that time, they launched this movie on DVD. I know some say the WB rush release of this movie because of The Dreamgirl's movie. But how do you rush the release of a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound. Come on wb, you can do much better than this. The sound and picture quality of this movie needs serious help. <br /> <br /> Seem WB did not put much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and I have a good sale. They could have kept the CD which by the way the dose does not have all the songs the original CD has. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB has to add some more special features. Take notes from other group films, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, where you can only see the performance and the sound on both is very, much, much better than this DVD.
