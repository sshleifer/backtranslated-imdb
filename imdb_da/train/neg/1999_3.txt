At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity. For a good reason! Super sleuth left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive justification, no acute analysis of signs of crime scenes. Holmes bumbles along fifty feet behind the plot. The shabby CAM is finally treated by an old scam in a way that would have made Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride six bullets in the bread basket. In a subsequent hunt, a pursuer gets hold of one of Watson's shoes. Don't decide to tackle the Cinderella story to prolong the movie. The murderer, Holmes and Watson, escaped scot free. Oh yes it's a bit of a change in the pace of late Victorian London. A little sexgun law :-)
