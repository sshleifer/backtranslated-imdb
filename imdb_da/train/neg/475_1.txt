One of the most obnoxious movies I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after seeing it. I watched this movie in my American history class and the purpose was to see an advance on the life of a farmer in the West in the late 1800s. What we saw was that pigs were shot and then slaughtered, human birth, branding. Oh, and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself was not too bad, but the many fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was OK. The premise of the story is widow and her daughter, and they are moving west to be a housekeeper for this cowboy. They live a life of hardships and it is an interesting quite accurate view of life in the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, don't watch this movie.
