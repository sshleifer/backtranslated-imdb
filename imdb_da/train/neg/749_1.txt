Now Image, UFO and others produce movies for the SCI FI channel that comes with budgets of about $ 2 million. Some have extensive effects, others have recognizable casts and still others have both - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines originally claimed that this movie was budgeted for $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $ 750,000 if it wasn't significantly less than that. Few sets are used, a number of scenes are shot against green screen, and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. It is painful to see. Not so much because it is badly directed, poorly executed and misunderstood, but because many of us have followed the development of this production for some time and had great hopes for this movie despite the relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken by the PT Bar.
