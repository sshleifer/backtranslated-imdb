We have an average family. Father is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white child and the cute little child. And we have careless housewife, which show has a housewife like this? Do we have a messed-up Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, mostly because I was young. The music was poor. The rapeseed was so bad and they were too g-rated. All his rapeseed were about his family and friends and problems. Father was a kind of girl from "Danny from Full House". Always gave advice. But he was not a pure freak. They had a housekeeper for it. Remember? The reasons were basically Lil 'Romeo was in trouble of any kind, or ... not that. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yes it's good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
