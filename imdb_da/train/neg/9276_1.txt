This is a really miserable little movie. Admittedly, the original sacred trinity was governed by the law of declining return with the third, "The Final Conflict", which turns into a ridiculous subplot about halfway through the film apparently merely to provide the necessary unnecessary overdue deaths that have now become whole raison d'etre for the "Omen" series. But then to continue with this jumping TV movie (beware of buyers of the Omen box on DVD - don't be fooled by the widescreen relationship between the transfer, this was and is strictly small screens) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers were unforgivable, especially supported by the exec.producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give away the plot, if any, beyond the usual death scenes (hopelessly toned down to television sensibilities) and some of the worst acts I've seen. Everyone involved in this project down to the restaurant people must be ashamed of this travesty ever made it to the screen, let alone masquerading under the name Omen. If someone is convinced of my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better about it.
