One of my best friends brought this movie over a night with the words "Want to see the worst horror movie ever?" I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad scarecrow and said yes. I had expected your typical cheesy b-slasher, but this was beyond B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the lows. With obviously low budget, extremely poor acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so-called 'special effects', shaking cameras and a horrible soundtrack makes the movie like House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about it is approx. 15 seconds when one of the persons gets topless - she had some very nice breasts. Most of what I said during this movie was in line with 'Wow, it's actually so bad', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not full enough for this'. So concluded: Don't waste your time (or money!).
