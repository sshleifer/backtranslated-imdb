No one laughs at all. Yes, I saw the whole train wreck, but only because I would not later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter. (No, he didn't.) This can be historically interesting to you youngsters out there to see that British "humor" included black "jokes" like these thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What amazes me even more is reading the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge that this is not very good, but then turn it over and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies you've seen are much worse than this one, then I'm sure for your torture existence. <br /> <br /> The mood level of this show is aimed at young children, but the subject does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated and drawn double-tar, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77) and other "low" humor. The three Stooges are still fun, and were also for me as a child. They have made an effort to make jokes. However, this is sloughed off schlock. I fear it is the end of civilization if these things are really accepted as worthwhile. Next you will tell me that tabloid TV is popular. :(
