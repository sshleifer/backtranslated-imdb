I was so excited when I discovered this was vacant! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's a bit of the kind of rarity CD from your favorite band you found in the back of the rack in your local music store. Being a hard core fan you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But once you've heard it, it became clear why these dogs never did it on a real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completionists' who need everything Lynch has done. "Six men get sick" is something visually interesting but short and repetitive. It lacks the power of Lynch's later work "The Grandmother" is simply an immature work. It's boring and looks like a student movie. But it was the 70s ... It's only interesting if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can briefly see the seeds of some of his trademarks pictures and sounds. "Alpahabet" is forgettable (No really! I can't remember this at all!) "Amputee" is meaningless. "Cowboy and Frenchman" is simply stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one worthy of the pile. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing tale that can be compared to his best work. I had to see this several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth renting or buying the DVD.
