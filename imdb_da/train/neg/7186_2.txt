I'm sorry for all the fans, but it's a useless movie. The play is bad, even wood, it overhypes the fear factor early and does not seem exactly. I think there should be a twist at the end, but it ended up being terribly confusing. What the heck? The guy who killed everyone was one of the hunters? Please try again. <br /> <br /> It's hardly original, and it's not even good as a straight slasher. And that says something. I think anyone who made castings who wrote the script and who thought of the concept should be relentlessly fired and deported. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. If someone puts this on a party, throw the disc out of the window and put a good scary movie like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
