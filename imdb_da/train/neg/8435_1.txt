Very disappointing movie. At the end, I no longer used any of the characters. I liked watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was good as always, still not worth seeing. It starts strongly and just gets weaker and weaker. Insomniacs will like it as I am sure it will put them to bed.
