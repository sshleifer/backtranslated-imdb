This movie could have been very good but coming up short. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could have looked past it if the story wasn't so miserable. If there was more of a background story, it would have been better. The reason is about an evil Druid witch attached to this woman who is getting migraine. The film pulls over and over again and never explains anything, it just keeps plowing. Christopher Walken has a role, but it is completely meaningless, just like most of the film. This movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad ones made for TV movies. I wanted to avoid this movie.
