Look, there's nothing spectacular offensive to this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with an end you can see before you've seen as much as the trailer. The main difference is that the classic rom coms tackle their stories with white and lack of pretension. This movie has no pretension, but it really has no movement awareness, you feel as if you could get up and go anytime. The production of the film also has the feeling of a debut film made about fifteen years ago. I would recommend looking at a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this superficial imitation. Oh, another BIG problem ... no chemistry. If you are used to seeing Michael look all sweet as Vaughn in Alias, you will be seriously disappointed with the way they have made him look here.
