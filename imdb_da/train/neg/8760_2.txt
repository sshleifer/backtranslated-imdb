This film allegedly relates to non-establishment types (aesthetic and sexual) that apparently cannot withstand basic romantic needs. Although some good players participate, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are founded by a puerile script that depends almost entirely on a smart dialogue. which is not. Nixon's role holds the best lines, but she often dwells too fast on them, a timing error that must be put on the director. The grotesque climax utilizes all available cliches, used or not, and completes this killing attempt on comedy.
