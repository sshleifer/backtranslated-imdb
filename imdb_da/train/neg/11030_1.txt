I recently watched this movie at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on the worst movies I've ever had the accident to see. Don't make me wrong, that's the funny and entertaining bad movies (eg "Manos ?? Hands of Destiny") and then there are the horrible bad movies. (This falls into the latter category). The kinematics were incredible and not in a good way. It felt as though the camera man deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between "a guy running around with a bulb" and "non-existent". The actors were as bad as soap actors, but not as bad as porn actors, giving the impression that each line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the appearance of the masked murderer, a classic look and a Jason Vorhees from "Friday the 13'Th". The reason was extremely poor, and the end was even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie should not look, or perhaps an insomniac that needs sleep.
