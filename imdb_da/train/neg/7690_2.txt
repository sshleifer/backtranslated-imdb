Anyone who gives this movie a good review must of course have something to do with the creation. This movie is a painful sigh celebration. The action is stiff, generic soundtrack is ridiculous, the direction is bland and strange of all, the teacher is really not that attractive (making the student's blatant progress the more creepy). The creative thoughts behind this garbage must dissolve and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude. I'm sure some hungry children in Africa could have spent the money wasting on this project. Hell, the funds would also have seen a more enlightened purpose that burned an abuser; at least someone would get entertainment out of it. Of the only reason it didn't give me a terminal illness, I give this movie a two.
