My husband and I went to watch this movie as we are the horror movie buffs. Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this movie basically contained the best points in the movie. There was nothing very scary about the film besides good timing on surprise entries etc. I found most of the "scary" parts to be more comical than anything. Having seen other films based on the works of Japanese authors, I have to conclude that what is considered scary in Japan is not what is scary here in the United States. My advice: If you're a fan of real horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through it. I can't really say I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental that comes to you.
