I don't often give a star reviews, but the computer won't let me make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although this is a low-budget utilization film, there are 17 producers credited. No. No. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the story, the abused man Kenneth comes home to his family in an exclusive gated community. The house is a spike piece. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) has let the kids run amok all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Mrs. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Uh, are these her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della runs to the mall, a slow scene that could have been cut. To undo the idea of ​​eeeeeeevil male aggression that is fierce in the universe, she drives past football players in full uniform play in pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Of course. For a bonus, she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it. <br /> <br /> We actually get excitement in the driving scene. It is raining and traffic is bad. First we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later, Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at some point turning all the way around to check the ringed rear seat of the charger for the phone. <br /> <br /> She walks in the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy things, but her credit card is rejected - gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he breaks, but it's too complicated for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ridiculous gang in the film's history. A white boy (Lukas Hass sees his career going down the toilet), a black, an Asian and a Spanish speaker. Imagine a company with Up People who has gone to the bad and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a gun, she gives them attitude. A mall policeman is going to examine the ruckus and they shoot him in the head and fire more than once. The parking lot is crowded as it can be, people everywhere and nobody knows. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in her car and instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit safe area, she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally ) at hand. <br /> <br /> MAJOR front spoiler. <br /> <br /> She is driving home. The car pops out so she goes through the slope. Checking on the kids goes down and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him in the mallet, showing him the gun and shooting him in a shiny area. <br /> <br /> The experience with the four punks would result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead, we know that her children are likely to spend Christmas in a nursing home or a group home because the state will gather them while she responds to killing an accusation. The four punks can be classified as proper murder in self-defense. The man, another story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw this on cable. If I had seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) I would have been furious. Like I am sorry to see talents like Mrs Basinger and Mr Haas wasting on waste like this. A really good thing. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford has not received another written or direct credit since passing this turd. There is justice in the world.
