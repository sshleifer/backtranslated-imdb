The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent, so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost out of revenge for a group of friends. The story is stupid, among two parts Ringu with some Prom Night, a splash of I know what you did last summer, and add a little dash Single White Female - now blend until completely obscene. There is nothing new on this plot and it is not even entertaining to review the clich√©s I have been so happy about. This movie jumps to and from the past too much, and when I understood it all, I still didn't see much meaning. Characters go from sane to psychic killer in the blink of an eye. Talking about characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer, the egocentric actress, the baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the creepy quiet chick, the nicer than the lovely girl, a freakin 'black cat .. And I didn't care about any of them. Maybe a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a particular "videotape" that would have been impossible to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror has to offer, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some scary pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh aloud at some of the top actor, or just want to shout "you're stupid!" On a movie screen, or just want another Asian scarecrow flicking up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plot look elsewhere.
