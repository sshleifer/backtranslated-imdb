A big disappointment. This was one of the best British drama / detective shows from the 90s that developed the fascinating title character played by Scottish Robbie Coltrane. But this one has little to add and may suffer from an inevitable disappointment due to increased expectations when a favored show returns after a long wait. Coltrane does not get much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act, he does not seem to be involved, almost sad. The ex-soldier's story is written by the books, and the attempt to update us on Coltrane's family life seems easy. Perhaps if the authors had a whole series ahead of them instead of just this two two-hour show, they would have written this with much more depth. Skip this and see the old Cracker from the 90s, which is far better.
