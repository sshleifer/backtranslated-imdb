For God's love, you can't see this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, just like the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this movie and its evil predictable villain are just lame. The characters are not developed and most of the film is padded with shots from Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual movie. To top it all, the play is a disgrace. I know everyone is trying to find their niche, but it's really a disaster. I can't believe anyone actually paid millions of pounds to put this movie on the screen. Don't waste money or time on this movie, go see your grandmother or something worth it instead.
