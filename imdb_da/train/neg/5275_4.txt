Delay is about a couple taking their family on vacation in New Mexico and finding themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour out of the main road to visit a town that apparently left in 1948 for unknown reasons. The town of Weaver seems harmless in the first place and having a tourist appeal to the family is stranded there overnight, and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same problems with fatal outcomes. Henley's watch a Blair-Witch-Project-esquire video diary left by the city's last victim, ironically demonstrating the best performance for anyone in this movie. Although Hamlin and Dey's performances are much better than the supporting casts, their emotional impact seems "flat" to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Failure to appeal to most of the movie, as there is a lot of excitement and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and incredible twists and turns that seem to make no sense. Worse yet, there really is no understanding of what is happening in the film, making the bizarre end less tolerable. It seemed to me that the filmmakers were so focused on making a stream of exciting scenes that they threw all elements of good story making: plot development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a coherent solution / outcome. <br /> <br /> The hardest aspect of the movie for me was that the first three-quarters of it was spent building excitement and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot, which were then suddenly disposed of as if we didn't deserve an explanation : <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to Weaver Weaver? What was the connection with the people at dinner? What did the sheriff know? What did the missing boy find out about something? <br /> <br /> This was, I think, a bad move when it created some angry. I had invested a lot of brainpower to hypothesize some plausible explanations for some of these plot shifts and weird events, just to get the filmmakers to finish it without answering any of those things. These are some beautiful cliff hangers for the end of a miniseries that are coming again next week, but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a self-contained movie.
