Although you subscribe to this film's knee war anti-free trade policy, it's still just the same tired note played over and over again and again. Clink clink clink. Although you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to the first principles, reverend Billy is quite difficult to look at as a serious figure. The clown honor is the kind that every morning neither awakens any more than to see his own face on television before he climbs back in bed at night. He has a beautiful wife I must admit, but it would take tons more than that to save this boring mess in a movie. The interminable bus routes are the worst part - with progress shown - can you guess? - by a colored line moving across a map. Aww, you guessed. Oh yes it has virtue to be short. Is that the only positive thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, afraid of it.
