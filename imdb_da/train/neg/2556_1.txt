Well, it's all been said about this movie, and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone else has already said what to say. But things are, I've seen zillions of movies and I'm working on writing reviews on all the movies I've seen. So I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The action is stupid. It's really stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness against the crash. Nunen is lovely and the professional assistant who will take care of the child. The three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid the movie makers can be. They do not realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. We can't see how the granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserved to die, you just didn't sympathize with them. And Uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been better. We only hear him scream and we see nothing!
