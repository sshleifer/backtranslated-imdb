I wanted to see this movie first, because the trailer gave the impression of a common and anticipated movie ... but as I recently had the pleasure of discovering the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (scriptwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it and thought that "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ..." And that is definitely not. The scripture is not bad, but it is not as true as "Mensonges ...", the actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as she usually does) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and to be honest I still understand not how such a crap can get such success, even with such casting. Yet history could have been a pretext for creating so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as Tirard's "Mensonges ...", even though it is written by him. Easy, unrelenting and lazy work. Completely Overrated!
