I honestly wish to return the last 30 minuets of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person suitable to watch the movie is Helen Keller. I kept saying to myself, it must get better, it must get better. <br /> <br /> Finally, the zombies came up and they had some washcloth paint on their eyes. <br /> <br /> They spoke like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> You were driving. <br /> <br /> Some voodoo women asked which of the "zombies" would be and "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (that was it) Out came the movie i couldn't take it anymore Can i sue for half an hour in my life ?????
