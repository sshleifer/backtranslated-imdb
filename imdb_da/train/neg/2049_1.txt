At least I could enjoy mopping the movie, which is surprising as I hardly could sit through it. Frankly, my guess is that the deck of the DVD case costs more than the whole movie. And to say that it's the same instructor as The Boogeyman when a new version of it just came out ... nice touches, it was misleading enough to force me in. The only thing that frustrated me more than the creepy act of copycat was his haircut. Normally you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy, and the character seemed like it. The movie looks as if it was shot by a D + grad student at a film school who was thrilled to use any movie technique he had ever learned while attending classes .... sometimes less more buddy. Through out I would be lost by random plot phrases that didn't look anywhere or were inexplicable. All this makes a bad movie, but when the end doesn't even come close to pulling it together, yes, it makes it an unusually bad movie. Without a doubt it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and that includes my friend's French final video for senior year in high school, but maybe I'm a little biased, I think I got to play an extra. P. S. I don't even think it deserves a star ... not a half. NOT FOR YOU !!
