After watching this movie on DVD, I saw the trailer. The voice describes the movie as surreal. Well, that is surreal and there is surreal. <br /> <br /> There was really only a part of the movie that seemed surreal to me, but honestly it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imaging, especially the lunch room scene where everyone is on the floor, was so unnoticed, they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't matter but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. My impression is that the director tried to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately, nothing I saw showed anything that Logan was thinking about what his perspective was or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he was not particularly pleased with his physical appearance and that he had an infatuation with an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the end signaled what the relationship between the boys had been, but not much else. Sufficiently coincident ambiguous scenes with those who were more straightforward seemed more like a policeman than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> The movie was for me yet so tiring and content-free, it was a definite change in pace. I liked Madagascar Skin, and I had the feeling that this movie was aspiring to that kind of story and maybe even style. It didn't even come close. For me, there is no doubt about it: this movie deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution.
