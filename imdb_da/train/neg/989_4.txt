Okay so I found out about this movie and I saw the prevween read almost all the reviews and had difficulty discussing whether to see it or not. Before I even saw the film I was emotionally curious about it. I was so uncertain whether I should look at this and be disturbed for a long time. So I choose to risk it and see it and heres what I thought: The beginning started fine for me. It seemed to be heading in a decent direction. Got past the rape scene and I couldn't figure out why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Don't make me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but it didn't really disturb me to a dramatic point. So when the middle came in I understood the boring things that were going on. There were like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walked around saying or showing nothing! It's one thing to have a shot where a person shows some kind of emotion, but this movie doesn't have it. It had about 3 of those pointless scenes where you see the main character Maya kind of get out of control, but it didn't show right, which made me want to fast forward. Then when she got engaged in hardcore partying it was not so boring, but still a bit boring. Oh and as a note, Rosario Dawson still did a good job. Okay moves so finally after an hour of indecency to the middle comes revenge to Maya's attention. That was where it was disturbing. I didn't feel bad for him, or he didn't get what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing, and I felt right after that. I can't really tell you if you want to watch this movie because it's so ... I don't know I can't find a word to sum it up. But if you choose to see it, just don't be unaffected.
