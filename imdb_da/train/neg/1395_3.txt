You know you're in trouble when the movie you see has many alternative titles. Generally, this means they tried and tried to hide the turkey in different markets. One such turkey is The Brain Machine, which has seven different titles. It's about a super secret government project that is supposed to be able to use a computer to read people, but instead drive people to kill each other or themselves or something. It's filled with B-level television actors sitting in panel attendance with lawn chairs trying to trade a script that almost doesn't make sense. It is a turkey of the unpleasant kind. Avoid it.
