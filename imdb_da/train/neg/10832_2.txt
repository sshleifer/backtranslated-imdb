Usually I don't have a problem with free swearing in movies, but this really annoyed me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And as someone else noticed, getting cancer) It was boring, wandering and pretentious. I didn't want if I were you. <br /> <br /> Also, I don't like movies that most people who like it claim to 'observe life'. I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that is happening in it is that a lot of Taiwanese people lead their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this movie and I used to work on a construction site. Then go figure. That said, William H. Macy has made me laugh. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid unless you enjoy tedium.
