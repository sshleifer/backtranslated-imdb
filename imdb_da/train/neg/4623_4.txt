If you have not seen the gong TV series, then you will not like this movie, not at all knowing that the series makes it a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it fun to help make up for its obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It is a fun snapshot of the era it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get many fun comos by people you've seen on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he does not make his personality on Air TV. 4) You will see many bizarre people doing all sorts of things just as you watch the TV show. <br /> <br /> I don't want to list all the bad things because there are many of them, but here are some of the most prominent ones. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show Movie has many of the actual TV show clips that get tired of movie length. 2) The history line of the film outside the clip segments is very weak and consists essentially of only one plot. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most of the other actors typically make way over the top 1970's flatness. It's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to see it all at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But even then it is not so good either. ;)
