First of all, there was nothing in this movie that really grabbed me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, it was nothing special" after I saw it. There were probably drama and things, but it just didn't grab me, but more the nail. As I said in the headline, it is very cheaply sought in a way. The quality of the film itself (the pictures) stuck to a low quality and reminded me more about some cheap made for TV movies than a well-known English film maker. The camera's angles and shots were very amateur as I think. Really does not have any close pictures or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I have not seen many English movies, and those I have seen have impressed me no more than this, and they did a little like doing the camera's work, colors and the like. "Game" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" about this if you wish), but it didn't work for me either. All in all, a little indifferent movie that was nothing special (at best I am scared) and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted.
