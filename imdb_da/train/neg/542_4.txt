First of all, there is the Gujarati Theater, so there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Vipul Shah's director should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati Theater when making a Bollywood production. First he made Aankhen (adapted from a gujarati game) - which had a unique plot, but could not hold like a Hindu movie. Now he has adapted another Gujarati game and is called Waqt - a race against time. Overall, the emotions are alien. Plot development is not for Hindi movies. For example, the role play between father and son is best left to the Gujarati Theater - do not take it in a Hindu movie. Even the comedy track is best back to the Gujarati scene. All performances are average - nothing to shout about - blocking Shefali Chhaya Shah, which is amazing.
