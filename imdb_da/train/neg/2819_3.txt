Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cultures, Robert Englund in a dual role, free sex and nudity, murder and chaos ... on paper Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, entertaining flick given the ingredients. It is not. It's a plot smaller, incoherent shambles that bring some entertainment. There is basically no reason beyond some vague things about a cult that follows De Sade's work, which for some unclear reason feels the need to seduce a local Christian archaeologist's daughter and kill her. That's pretty much it - I think it has something for the gnostics, but who knows what the authors thought. Most of the film is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various notifications, dream sequences and erotic encounters, interkut with Englund's scenes as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing landscape. It seems that decision makers tried something serious, but regardless of their pretensions, they were buried in cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze, and fake looking beheaded heads. There are not many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the leading actress Zoe Trilling, although not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of dressing through the film, but watching Night Terrors is a task. In any case, I came to watch the movie from which "When you are as criminal as I" suffered from the Australian film certification ratings guide, which was on the cover of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from.
