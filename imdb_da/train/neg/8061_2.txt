May I start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work a lot. I wish he was in several movies showing his talent. That being said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I put almost all the blame on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an excellent performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the girl in Hollywood. I don't think any of the actors really got into the script and I understand why. Saying that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement. It had the terms you could expect, but they just didn't lead anywhere ... except for more confusion. I just found the end very anti-climatic because it just didn't seem to make sense or really answer any of the questions I had about the story. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can't. In honesty, the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you have paid for it.
