Non-existent plot, tons of badly directed / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world famous snipers who can't even hit their targets a few feet away? Plus what's with the end? ---> a bunch of law enforcement officers vandalize a carnival's shooting gallery ? WTH?), Technical flaws (how many balls can you fit into a blade of a gloss? 100 +? These people burn their weapons without having to reload). The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) cannot save this junk. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie (I realized I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one). Hopefully the director would either stop making movies or learn more for his next movie.
