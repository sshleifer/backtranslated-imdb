I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. A lot of "time facts" were off. At the start of the film, Grandpa commented on this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. This movie was to take place in 1994. One of the grandchildren's friends also had an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He wasn't even prepared yet. The story line was good, but the facts and reality of the time frame were so far away that it made the movie seem cheesy. My boyfriend is an avid reader of World War II books and memorabilia. I rented this movie and hoped it would be good. The action was so-so. The dog was sweet. But the way this movie was done made me happy that I only paid $ 4 to rent it as opposed to 50, it would have made me see it in a theater. I hope that anyone who ever reads this will understand that I do not feel any dissatisfaction with those who fought for the war, but the facts and timeframes should have been closely monitored.
