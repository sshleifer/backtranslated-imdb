I really can't believe that this movie is not in IMDB's worst 250, it's absolutely horrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had seen it too. We told all other class members not to see it because it was so terrible. When we were finished, some people would just see it because they couldn't believe anything, just as bad as we said it was. Don't be like them, just pass it by. I'm sure everyone involved in this movie would also prefer you to never see them in this movie.
