Never cast models and Playboy rabbits in your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, of which Bogdanovich was obsessed with having married SISTER after her murder in her low-living man, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actress either. I expected to see some kind of lost masterpiece on Orson Welles, but instead Audrey Hepburn got cavorting in jeans and a god-horrible "poodlesque" hair-making .... Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show "I could see again and again. This clunk I could hardly sit through once. This film was reportedly not released because of the Brouhaha around Ms Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
