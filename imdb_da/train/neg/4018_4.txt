This movie is for the skeleton. It's a pretty low-budget movie (I hope!), Which apologizes a little, but the lack of a decent cast and a plethora of plot makes it too much. Phillips is completely trustworthy in her role as an upset son of a wealthy family who is searching for herself (though his family is ... well ... a little bit too white ...), but the rest of the casting takes hold of joists. Every moment that has potential is destroyed by excessive melodrama, and there is * way * too many subplots (which is a clear sign of plot deficiency). They needed filler ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone, nor is there a hard-core Phillips fan, or who has absolutely * nothing * to do. 10.4.
