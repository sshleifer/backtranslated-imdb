Of course, 3kg is just a self-reliant program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and unlike Grey's Anatomy, brain surgery cases are not equally interesting. This program should be set in a leading center for neurological cases - but there is nothing interesting or exciting to do! Not even the so-called pathetic "feud" between him and a rival adds something to the show, nor the hallucinations. In the pilot there was a brief insight into the leader's social life as a father - snooze! boring and pointless. <br /> <br /> This show is pants, there are a lot of medical dramas at the moment, and it does nothing to make it stand out as special.
