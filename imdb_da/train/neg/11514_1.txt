Without a doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie career. If you have through the trial of looking "swept away" then you know at the level that it was a battle made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress" she may have said in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can't get out of herself for a long time to make a show that anyone with a taste could even call decent. And that's what makes people not like her so much on the screen: the stupid feel that her ego is so bloated that it prevents her from being able to escape and connect with her audience. If there is any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.
