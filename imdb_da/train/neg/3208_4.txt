This movie was a big disappointment to me. I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a loyal supporter of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they split half of the story, but the changed information. The statement that Lucifer is Hope's father is untrue. He corrupted his father, but he himself is not his father. The voices also don't fit the characters, and when you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can't even remember everything about this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is, if you love Lady Death, don't see this movie. It just didn't do the comic justice !!
