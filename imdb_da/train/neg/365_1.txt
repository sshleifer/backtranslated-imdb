Bad plot, poor dialogue, bad acting, idiotic control, the annoying porn track soundtrack that ran over the exaggerated script, and a crappy copy of VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming spirits. Trust me because I stuck this turkey to the end. It was so pathetic bad that I had to find out that it was a fourth rate for Springtime for Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only weak spark of interest and it was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar, but a thousand times better, then see Beyond the Doll of the Dolls.
