I've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed by the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can't say I found much to recommend it. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not only too heavy-handed but boring outside of targets. The movie looks authentic enough, but something has to happen to make it work, and nothing much does: a superficial plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, anything thematic. It just collapsed. Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has some moments of real wonder and is a movie I will soon see again. For a brilliant reconstruction of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is much better than "McCabe".
