This superior minority to the original stupid "Blind Dead" movie is another waste of waste. So many people have hyped up these movies that I can't believe what they are saying about it. Since I was a kid, I have heard how scary and big these movies are and I saw them all and were very disappointed. Were all the drugs from the 1970s, or just don't know how boring this raw is?
