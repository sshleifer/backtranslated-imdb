Yes, definitely better than my view of Death Tunnel. In fact, some of the deaths were pretty original and were pretty decent. It was a bit like Wrong Turn meets Hills has eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When the "kids" (high school or college?) discuss horror movies in the kitchen, say everything Shae says almost a precise quote from Scream (1996). The case of the big-breasted girls etc. 2.) Was Steve NOT a bootleg Randy from Scream? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what the hell did the movie do with Samhain? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me. I find it humorous when I see these horror films from the 80s explaining away loose ends by pointing fingers at the druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow they made a Sam Raimi reference !!! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters had nothing to do with anything. And is he so mental that he couldn't even see his own death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at that time the death was simply Troma-licious), how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs, but didn't hear them when she was standing outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis, primarily a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is, if you are like Shae and don't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole movie, will you be the one to live? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like walking dishes of Chili con carne. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they broke Gary's sister, they forgot that Steve HAD was stuck there and wondered where he was going? 11.) Was there no more than one killer? Shae hit one, but was never hit by any of them. <br /> <br /> 12.) What were the flashbacks for the other people? Half of them, Shae did not know if they were dead or alive, so what was that about? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why has no one ever called the police? And apparently everyone knew that the people were living in the woods, why did they never organize any kind of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they weren't zombies OR vampires - so how could she "become" one in the end? I'm with everyone else on the huge "huh?" at the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe better than death tunnel, but still pretty sloppy. I still don't understand why they even placed it in Ireland when Samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot.
