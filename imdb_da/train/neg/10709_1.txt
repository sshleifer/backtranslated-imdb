I can't imagine much about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie ... I can't even tell you what made me see it. It had so few redeeming qualities that I didn't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The ground moved from inexorably to absurdly. My whole body was tense for the entire movie, because I couldn't wait for the awful thing to be over and done. At the end of the movie I found myself numb. <br /> <br /> The editing was poor, the play was underpair and the story was weak. Francoise Robinson was thrown like an Indian, although she didn't even look like any of the native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie is to be this idiotic, it must be ridiculously stupid - at least. It wasn't. It was just pathetic.
