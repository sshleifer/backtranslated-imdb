Returning Boogyman is a horrible movie that does not play as a movie, it plays as an episode of a television sitcom when they flash back to older episodes. Return of Boogyman is just a clip show. <br /> <br /> The mutch of the movie is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. Over and above the same pictures. How boring this is. <br /> <br /> The film is really about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over and I don't know who would. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and that's it.
