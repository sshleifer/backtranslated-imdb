In one respect it is like 'The Wizard of Oz', with Paris in black and white and Riviera in color. But it is apparently about possessive love, destructiveness, and moral decadence, while in fact it is about designer dresses, Riveria shots, lots of big expensive cars and music and dance intervals that suggest Vincente Minnelli on one of his off-days. Watchable, but a remarkable example of desperate, dark plot material and glittering style headline in opposite directions. (Was this model the 'The Talented Mister Ripley? Does anyone feel an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
