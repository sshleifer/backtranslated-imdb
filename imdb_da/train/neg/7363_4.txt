The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that it has Erika Eleniak in it. She is sexy as always, but she plays second enemy to leading man Wolf Larson. It's a shame because she has more action capacity than she is allowed to show here. The film largely consists of endless shootings that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you see the evil armed with machine guns constantly missing Larson and he only armed with a revolver (who never runs out of bullets) takes them all out quite easy. The earthquake effects are decent, but there is also a lot of blurred motion and bad CGI explosions. As the psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo he has to defy is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (provided he has no) may want to give this a look, for others it is hardly worth renting. (* 1/2)
