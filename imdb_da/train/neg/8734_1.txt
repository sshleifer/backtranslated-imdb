Maybe I've seen too many crimes, or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most clich√© ridden, plot flawed, plot-absurd, simply stupid movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> As far as the direction is concerned, it seems that it took less time to show this than it did to put it together. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems to make it directly to the video before it was finished. <br /> <br /> It's a bad rip off of the "M" classic Fritz Lang movie starring Peter Lorre. You would be so much better off renting it instead.
