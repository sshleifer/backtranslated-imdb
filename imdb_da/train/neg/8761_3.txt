My boyfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies no one has ever heard of. Certainly, it has sometimes led to some fun discoveries. Often, the best thing can be said to surely run an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought the home "Advice from a Caterpillar." She was thrilled because the box said it was fun. Lucky for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself, you will hate all the characters in the movie. Until the introduction of one beautiful character. Which leading annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that in the real world it would drive someone away. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE ON <br /> So a bunch of emotionally stupid, fast-paced, pretentious artists swear love and find success in their careers. Then they meet a lovely, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (an almost perfect guy). We then see the woman, the annoying pretentious artist (in her 30's?) Freak out as she falls in love. So she tries to escape from the cozy, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she has had good but empty sex. She is rude to the man and does everything possible to drive him away. In the real world she would have been quite successful. I would definitely flee from her, and I wasn't even with her! <br /> <br /> Although it was great that the man fought for his love, I would never have her have him. (Neither did my boyfriend) she didn't deserve him. And why do I ask the instructor that the 'almost perfect guy' should be punished by winning a relationship with her? When the artist asked the 'almost perfect guy' to leave, we screamed for him to leave too. There is a problem with a movie when the movie's heroine is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the annoyance. As for the other characters, they were well-acted, moral bankruptcy and annoying signs. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say I laughed a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, there was not much laugh for the last 10 minutes or so. But when I had these laughs, I had asked for the film to end too long. I needed to get those vapid characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see people you hate fighting with a love for people they don't deserve, then this is the movie for you.
