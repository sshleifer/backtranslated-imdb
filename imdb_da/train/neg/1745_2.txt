The first half hour of the film had a steady pace and introduced the characters. But all of a sudden everything went too fast, a lame cause of Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very high at acting by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. Overall, this movie was the biggest disappointment that the movie is not entitled to its trailer. save your money and don't watch the movie, see Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> sums it up: a cheap stage show and look for the movie, no story or fabric, the plot was extraordinarily unmistakable good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! Keep going! movie shot everyone in a room, new comers (female cast) was okay as it was their first movie, but established actors like Akshey and John are totally disappointed that an established instructor like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!
