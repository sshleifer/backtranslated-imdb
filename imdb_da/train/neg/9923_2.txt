As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studies seem to be definitely destroying as many classic movies as they can with thoroughly meaningless updates, including 'King Kong,' The Wicker Man 'and almost any movie ever starring Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon but as "Dough for Do-Do" evidence. A completely pointless colored version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks life out of the original by spraying the color over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage watched by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an inappropriate instructor to manipulate with Clampett's source material, but in reality no director could come close to Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably, "Dough for Do-Do" is nothing more than the rape of a classic with a horrible new title attached. For cartoon fans like myself, this corresponds to a coloring of 'Casablanca'.
