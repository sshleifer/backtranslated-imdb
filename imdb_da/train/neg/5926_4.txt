Another weak third season entrance, 'Is there really no beauty?' nevertheless, at least one key element that is very different and which Spock would say has fascinating. The protagonist is a stranger who has to be transported around in a black box, because his appearance is so terrible that it drives people crazy. It's too bad that the episode can't live up to this incredible premise. Of course, I think it was a mistake to ever "show" the alien, as the real point of view in no way approaches such a frightening structure; All we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for a number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship passes through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, Kollo's appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock and only if Spock has a special visor. (Long ago, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos', which I found humorous, but I go down.) Spock is obliged to think with Kollos at some point so the alien can return Enterprise to safety. This has been achieved, but when Spock / Kollos goes back to finish mind-telling, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Oh oh. He gets crazy, but eventually resurrected by Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This could have been a really bizarre, outstanding episode, but it is poorly directed and comes across yet another poorly run show in the last season series.
