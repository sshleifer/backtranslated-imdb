What a weekend. Two days ago I saw in the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While she was out". I am trying to make a decision which was worse with regard to pain in my mind as you watched. I suppose the "While she was out" was worse. It has all been said earlier in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical, etc. - All I really have to add is that at one point I started to feel more for the evil guys than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin prize if she actually died (only looking at the first half so I don't know). Soon I was at two Darwin Awards (if even possible) for her huge stupidity. <br /> <br /> And Hi: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she knew not only the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, the people? I consider people who waste significant amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and dress a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent, which are idiots , a good opportunity to show how much an idiot they are.
