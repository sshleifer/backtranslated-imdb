What made the idea of ​​seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would meet the Charlotte Bronte brilliance of the original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to find out that this movie, which seemed to be either written or filmed at great speed, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester seemed to be missing either from the manuscript or left on the rock floor. Also lacks Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self-confidence, which allowed her to suffer through her turmoil and victories over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to overcome, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame to ask for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved, was, in my opinion, exciting parts of the story that were simply omitted from this movie. The title sign seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unpleasant, and for those who did not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story would be least interesting. The play and Direction did a little if any credit to the classic story.
