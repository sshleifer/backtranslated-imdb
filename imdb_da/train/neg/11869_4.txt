I don't know if the problem I had with this movie is that I couldn't catch the way movies were made earlier, but I think this one didn't miss making use of any of those Fashionable Conventions Available in the 40s to Make a Movie. If you have nothing better to do, my advice is not to watch this movie, but to read a book or go on a trip.
