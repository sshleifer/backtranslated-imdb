The movie starts with a voice over to tell the audience where they are and who the characters are. And that's the moment I started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities that every film director has in hand, I really find it a very easy and inexpensive solution to express the situation with a voice to tell everything. In fact, I believe that vote overruns are treason to the film production concept. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear from a voice over where we are, what date we are in, and especially what the characters feel and think. I think an instructor should find a visual way of conveying emotions and thoughts to the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the bad influence intro begins a very striking movie and continues for quite some time. The lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfectly realistic way. I think the director has a talent for capturing real-life situations. Eg. A father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom can only appear abnormal, but life itself leads us to some abnormal situations, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer about real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. Eventually, the realism of the film begins to sacrifice the story of history. I really felt like I have a big headache because of the non-stop talking signs. It was as if the actors and actors were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It is realistic really, but characters always ask "really it is so" etc. For each other, or characters who say "no" or "do you listen to me" ten times when you say that only once is just enough I get myself to have headaches. <br /> <br /> I also think that toy training and book scenes are more than they should be. I understand that the play and the book in the movie are very related to the plot, but I think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.
