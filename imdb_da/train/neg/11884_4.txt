The world's largest inside joke. The world's largest and most exclusive indoor joke. <br /> <br /> Emulating brash and 'everyman' humor in office space, this film appeals to this movie in the ground by making humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to take on an unknown role as a legal secretary, and then empathize with the incredibly stupid protagonist. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is centered on the legal secretary who finds leisure time, listening to music and writing a novel while working. These are his goals. You can't imagine flap in the face, it's for the audience when they (halfway through) find out that he has had a job that fits all three of these criteria, but then it does! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist who has previously thrown it as he complains about the lack of. <br /> <br /> Apart from the bigger obstacle, the legal secretary fails to insider humor because they have to be explicitly explained to the audience every time they happen. Without these pages, the audience would not have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it doesn't have to be thoroughly explained to the public, what is fun.
