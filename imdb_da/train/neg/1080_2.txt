How an Altman's experience could ever expect us to spend time or to care about what's happening to a leader who is neurotic, a whiner, a jerk with no redeeming qualities - that's the key puzzle about this deeply confused work. An outrageous piece of waste. In addition to this devastating error, the plot line requires serious concentration to follow. The set-up that the Branagh character enters into is, of course, a set-up from the start that we tend to wonder if the author and the director have completely lost respect for their audience. This last question is at the heart of the movie: It represents direct self-confidence with deep contempt for the viewers' taste, values ​​and intelligence. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
