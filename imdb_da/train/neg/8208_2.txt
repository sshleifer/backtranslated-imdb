"Hi everyone! I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped thing from the outer space, so why don't we wipe it out and open it up?" "Yes, I know it would be the stupid thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses that were unknown to the earth and could potentially wipe out mankind, but hey, I'd like to know what is in it." "And no one tells NASA they can take it away from us". "Wow, this thingie gives away vibes!" "Yes, really strong in contact, so don't touch it, but it's okay to cut it open". "Hi there, check out my sips". (Later the same day); "DO NOT OPEN" !!!!! Uh, we have to go all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or radios or intercoms, even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, limb take this stick and staff it." "I come out of here, I don't care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one is 'me!' "Look! It's the friendly aliens from" The Abyss "! They want us to come with them". end
