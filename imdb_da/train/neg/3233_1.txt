C'mon people you can't be serious, another case of advertising snuff when it's not at all! This is not even extremely intimidating, nor is it scary or depraved - it is just utterly horrible amateurish video work made for the next party to get the girls laid. <br /> <br /> Gore is incredibly bad, even the eye scene is far from making me want to puke, but just getting me to take the camera and beat those guys over their heads. The girl is just lying there rubber movement and not at all moving. It would have been more fun to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> A season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more scary than this. Don't waste your time or your money.
