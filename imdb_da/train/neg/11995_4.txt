I was so excited and hyped up to watch this movie when the promoters first came out in November! It looked amazing and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to see it! This is a movie that weaves 6 couples together. It has a multi cast of 12 people! A large amount of stars have been working on this movie. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, hasn't done the job well and shouldn't have had many people in this movie as it would make it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's direct debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', 'Salaam-e-Ishq' falls backwards. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors in this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are amazing, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy has done an excellent job and has done good jobs over the years. I think the reviews of this movie can go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this movie by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude to see this with the family! Although some may find this naked as a comedy, it is not something you would like to see with parents! I think the best play was done by Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think it's a good movie!
