A movie about dealing with the problems of growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is insane to those who like to surf and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this movie, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays her boyfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug abusive pal. <br /> <br /> For those who don't like surfing or Cornwall at least, you'll find it takes a long time before the movie itself suggests to be interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus for many protagonists, most of them are one-dimensional. The reason is an interesting idea, but because of the low figures you have no idea why they are acting in the situations they are put in. Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine's characters make it a movie worth being on videotape, why It was only released on videotape in the United States after Ewan and Catherine reached the regular fame.
