Sistas in then hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except when the hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s. I can't remember any westerners like this when I grew up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil 'Kim, then he could say, "Okay! I must admit that I just sat here to see her. Bare midriffs and blonde cut blouses are not the usual cowboy girl's staples, but they are cowgirls, and That's fine. <br /> <br /> Now, don't look for any major story here, and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama is in a different setting, and when is the last time you heard John Wayne call anyone "Dawg"? And I can't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to OK Corral. <br /> <br /> I see this at BET, so I missed the action that got it is an R rating, but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to watch it unless I can be sure it was Lil 'Kim in that act.
