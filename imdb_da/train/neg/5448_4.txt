Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down. Even in the most trying circumstances Day gives 100% and usually comes out unharmed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a lifeless New York City blackout in 1965, but actually adapted from a late 50-French game by Claude Magnier, gives Doris a little to do, but falls into its own goody-goody image and in the second half , be comically sedated (which is fun because of the spin spin gives the situation). There are some fun lines here, but the staginess of the material has obviously been transferred from the game ... and instead of inducing some fun events within the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris' co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not well-suited to her, nor is the beautiful hairdresser they wear. Still, it's not terrible, it has a couple of big laughs, and for Day buffs it's a must-see. ** from ****
