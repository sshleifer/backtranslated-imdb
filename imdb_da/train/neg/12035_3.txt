I expected this to be much better. I love Tim Burton's work so I was very happy to see these online short films. Well, they were not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what I really like. I think they're just kind of boring. The sound disturbs me and most of the characters, though I loved Roy The Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode probably believed me even though it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> I also don't like the way some of the characters die. Like how the match girl essentially puts the gas station on fire, or how the girl who stares dead, in general. Roy's death was entertainingly surprising. Death of a car renewer. Very original ;-) It made me laugh so hard ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that do not suit children. Just some languages ​​and do. It's all about everything I have to say! 3.10
