Buffaloes of Vanities are a film soaked in flop sweat. I can't remember any movies that have been trying so hard to be so tirelessly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board. It's like a stand-up cartoon that doesn't laugh, but can't leave the scene. The harder the movie tries, the higher each attempt at a laughter results in a resounding spout. The desperation that the film shows is so sharp that it almost blocks with pity for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The movie only achieves twice grin-high status. Once in mind Geraldo Rivera plays an unpleasant, arrogant and amorous TV tabloid journalist - who's just funny because he doesn't seem to know he's playing himself. The second scene that deserves to be laughing is the film's last "big moment", where the judge, played by Morgan Freeman, delivers the sanctifying talk about what morals are ("that's what your mother taught you!"). The momentum of the moment is insulting to being absurd. <br /> <br /> But one must admit that it is a noble effort. It has a good, if bad cast, band of actors trying to make characters out of cardboard thin cartoons. The movie looks professional, and the little movie film flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves, apparently if not very effective. But the film, which apparently wants to be a comment on modern morality and ethics, never arises above the drawing level. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom requires timing. But the best Bonfires can pattern is desperation. In the end you will not laugh, you just want to turn away.
