Five across the eyes is not worth one of the wrists, I have to admit at some point I was really worried, for about 30 seconds no noise and I thought my speakers had been blown or I had gone deaf With the constant screaming and loud tone screaming, I and the speakers are ok now, thanks for asking, funny enough it was the best bit of the movie. <br /> <br /> I won't waste your time telling you the plot, reading the other comments for it. <br /> <br /> If you purchased this DVD but not yet unpacked it. Don't take it back and claim the money back, I wasted my do not. I actually yelled at the telly "they are here in the car, look for the camera light and get the camera man first", I have left the swear words, but you can guess where they are going. <br /> <br /> If anyone wants to buy this movie (it's really good) it is yours for a ten quid.
