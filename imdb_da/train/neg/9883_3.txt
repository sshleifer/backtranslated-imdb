Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked. She does a pretty good job with an immature, uncertain 16-year beauty, in fact <br /> <br /> 2) Many shots on a beautiful Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> <br /> 1) Peter Hooten becomes the worst actor of an actor since Brutus played Caer's friend in the "Roman Senate Proceedings of March 15". He delivers every line in a lovely baritone bellow. Lower the volume when speaking. Preferably all the way down <br /> <br /> 2) Bo's fantasies are unfortunately tame, especially in today's standards. A few laps in the bath and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The reason is skimpier than Bos's costumes
