What a long, pronounced, meaningless movie. I am sure that this film is historically delicious, but as entertainment it just doesn't go with the character. Ralph Fiennes has been in some amazing movies, the English patient, Schindler's List, but this one was such an easy-down. It didn't seem to go anywhere, his character in the beginning was so low and tight, it surprised me that his "sister" would ever have been interested. Don't pay to rent this movie, buy yourself a copy of the English patient instead.
