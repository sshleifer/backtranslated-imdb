After we counted the use of the f-word, oh, approx. 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie, we listened to some really bad actors that were about a woman and a horse, and pretty much seems like 12 year old boys to be naughty together, well, we beat it off. Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a losing Hollywood movie, product of imaginative and no talent writers. <br /> <br /> We gave it another chance, but it would be better. No dice. Later my boyfriend jumped through the rest of the movie, if it was improved, still no dice. <br /> <br /> The protagonist had a cool bike. I would not recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature youngsters or frat boys.
