This was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad I laughed through the whole movie! The reason was so cheesy; especially the end. This movie turns from an end-of-the-world catastrophe to the rescue eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPET for the eels! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mother, my sister and I couldn't finish it and when we finished it was about a year later! The second time we looked at it and we finished it this time, we made MST3K-like comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: Just watch this if you're a movie basher! Make fun comments, watch this on a sleeper for laughs, and I mean big laughs. Beware of the fog. The metaphor that explains this movie: This film is a very low field filled with cheese and socks!
