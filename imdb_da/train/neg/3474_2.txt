This thing is horrible. The Ben Affleck character is self-centered and pleasantly sadistic - punch-you-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic. And he is the romantic hero! His cartoon-like character does not change from the beginning to the end, but his money ultimately gives him the opportunity to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would screed without faith, but I'm not a socialist. <br /> We capitalists like a little Christmas magic from time to time. This is not magical. I do not know what it is. It's just awful. And it's a terrible waste of talent. O'Hara has made me play hysterically since the late 70's. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underutilized. If Ben was out of the equation, these people could have dreamed something good.
