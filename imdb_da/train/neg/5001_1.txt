I don't know why I'm commenting on this stupid reality show. I happened to watch a couple of episodes (a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something I didn't watch the whole thing. Only as three episodes) when I was nine months pregnant and going to work every day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) I'm sorry Britney, I really do. For all her money and fame she seems to have very little sense of dignity. Or she is self-centered to the extreme. She married nitwit Federline (okay anyone can make a mistake) and before she "stares" this horrible show about her everyday life with him, where she pushes a video camera where she feels like it, whether in your face or in the shower when Federline is in there. She stumbles on her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination, I don't care about my part, but I can't help wondering how she feels about it now when she's divorced. And yes, for her sake, I'm embarrassed. But I shouldn't be. She seems to live a rather empty, low life herself. I won't change life with her even though I could. Road-kill TV if you want.
