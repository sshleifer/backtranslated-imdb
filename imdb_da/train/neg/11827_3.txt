Just got back from a free screening and I'm very glad I didn't pay to watch this very sub-par movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of children and adults. It looked like it was just the kids who laughed at all the slap stick and speed jokes though (good god they loved to hit those poor mice in the crotch a lot!). The movie is pretty young, incomprehensible, predictable and mostly annoying. The signs just seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space and the relationship between them all seemed very forced without charm at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is about average with nothing really stand out. They did a decent job of imitating the clay look of Wallace and Gromit, but apart from that, it is very forgettable imaging. Even though I'm really bored in the whole movie, I jumped a couple of times. It is not an absolute failure, but I would definitely not like to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and don't care if your kids see funny cheap jokes), let them take it to see it, but everyone else shouldn't waste their money.
