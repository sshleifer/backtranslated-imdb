The only reason I saw the movie to the end was "hope" to see something interesting. The movie is really bad and the girls' performance is really, really bad, honestly, I'm not a film critic nor an expert, but you just need common sense to note that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started talking was: "She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and he agreed to help her with the manuscript and is seen in her movie when she is the one brilliant director ". .. surprise, surprise the next day after I watched the movie, I found out the internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Terrible story and horrible performance.
