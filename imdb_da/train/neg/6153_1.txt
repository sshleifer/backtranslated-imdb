So let me start by saying that I saw this movie as part of an offer. I was really boring a nice 1997 day, and then I went over to the movie rental shop. I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in store was. Without hesitation he went over to "Lucky Stiff." He told me he would waive the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So see what I did, for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. God-horrible self. I don't have to go into plot details, read the other reviews. The witnesses make no sense. The action was horrible. I know it should be a comedy, but the protagonist's stupidity was exhausting. You can try to see it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not even fun that way. Avoid!
