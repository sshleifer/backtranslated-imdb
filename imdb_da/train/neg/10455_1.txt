$ 25,000 Pyramid Clues: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slither. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies that were more fun and exciting than Snakes on a Plane. Hell, with that definition, I would include the relatively tough Ted and Elaine's airplane journey! as superior to snakes in both laughter and excitement. The sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of any accidental intentional funny snake movie: Anaconda! Besides the never-to-be-seen casting of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same flick, you had Jon Voight pulling out the full-time cinematic hoist. His final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a "so ludicrous-it's-fun" movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst business partners possible. Every major scene had been discussed and dissected so much in the last year, all that was left to entertain at the opening of the night was the amount of fanboy float sweat that had to be bred in my theater. I heard more forced grin here than on a studio that taped after "According to Jim".
