No one liked this movie for its profit, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then that's for you. It is located up there with "Road House" for its upscale figures, sets and history line. The bad writing really blew me: "I want you to dust these guys away" instead of "... dust those guys." F-14s take off from the carrier, but when they get in formation, they are F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who only minutes before overseeing a hidden mind-wipe at Seagal. Segal runs out of balls and resorts into a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, the guards guard all their weapons and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a dud, but explodes anyway. The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Segal flies back to California - the long way, that is, through Europe - though there is an airline that gives him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea. CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of meters and maps on the walls. What a hoot!
