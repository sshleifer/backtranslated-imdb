As the army veteran, I was deeply offended by this movie. It is, in my opinion, a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this bush is an understatement. If the movie was presented as a satire or even a comic book (it was), it would have been better received. But it was taken seriously my many people, especially abroad. Silly as it sounds, wherever I went in Europe in the late 80s, people seemed to judge me and the Americans generally by this movie. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled by a prison gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to release some US POWs. In an ongoing battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammunition and never overheats. And he never misses running with a 32 pound gun held up with an arm. I could go on, but I have a headache. I gave this only 2/10 because it's a little better than Rambo III.
