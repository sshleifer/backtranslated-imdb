This became a cult film in Chinese college students, though I didn't see it until it was broadcast in Channel4, UK. <br /> <br /> Full of arty giddy pretentions, the plot is mediocre and unreal; The 'spirit' it wants to convey is how independent artists stand against commercial music industry 'and maintain their' purity in an artistic soul 'and would not' sell themselves for dirty money '. it is really giddy and shallow; The diologist is mainly pathetic. the action is poor. sceenplay is full of art prevalence. It's a fantasy movie for kids and it's all <br /> <br />
