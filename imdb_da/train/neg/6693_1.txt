Drive away from this movie. Even at B film standards, this movie is horrible. It is also insidious in that theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and do not respect anything are cool and worthy of admiration. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for much better than this movie, see it instead. No normal kid would do what Trent does. State troopers don't work as they do in this movie, etc. By watching this movie, you get an insight into why authors use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold clich√©. Mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker, who, yes, has had a terrible life. But she is such a horrible person, the audience cannot identify with her. <br /> <br /> Normally, there is one thing that a movie can be recommended, because in this case there is none. It's such a ridiculous movie that offends the person trying to identify with the protagonists. The action is appropriate to B movie standards, and the direction does not present anything new or interesting.
