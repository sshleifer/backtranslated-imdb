Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and learns quickly that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is they don't exist - Ollie has apparently made them up! So it is up to him and his girlfriend to find a lady with a baby who will agree to be like her family. <br /> <br /> This is not a unique story story that I have at least seen a few other silent shorts with this precise plot. Best of them was Bobby Vernon's KID NOT ME. It's much better than ONE TOO MANY - probably much of it was because it was made a decade later - when the comedy became a little more sophisticated and proud less on a pointless slapstick. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick movies people start shooting weapons wildly, kicking and smothering each other etc. with a little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TO MANY, it is exactly what they do. None of that makes sense and it was as if they would just run out of history ideas. Overall, not a milestone in entertainment. There's just not enough payout to profit to see, unless you're an obsessive silent fan like myself.
