This movie couldn't decide what it would be. There were a few sub-plots that for a while made you believe that these things would all come together eventually ... but they didn't. If you want a "foreigner in the frozen waste" story, hold onto the 1950's version of THE THING (not the abomination that was reminded in gore-o-vision 20+ years later). <br /> <br /> I couldn't overcome the fact that the "alien" looked a lot back from the Independence Day. <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and settle the intended mood. <br /> <br /> Lots of scenery chews with little payout.
