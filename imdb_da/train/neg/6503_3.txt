What Hopkins succeeds with this effort as an author and instructor gives us the feeling that we know absolutely no one in the movie. But perhaps there is the problem. His film has great ambition, and his intentions were of course complex and drawn from very deep inside, but it is so impersonal. There are no signs. We never know who is and therefore there is no investment on our part. It may be that a screenwriter interferes with his own characters. Is it? Maybe. I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I think there is no narrative. Hopkins movie is an experiment. On the other hand, one can do the case that it is an arbitrary screenwriter who, at the moment he meets with fate, realizes that life is hit and miss, and / or success is blind chance that he is beaten into a "slipstream" of collisions between times, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nevertheless, it is so incredibly mind-boggling that it does not make room for any kind of feeling, even in the small, rather rudimentary scale, which allows us to connect with its signs. <br /> <br /> I didn't think nippy and flamboyant school of chatter, pistol-speed camera work and editing decoupled me but reflecting the movie, I start to realize that it had a lot to do with it. There are so many films from the last decade, where the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmospheric aggravated technical doodads. I assume in this case that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of the dream. But I hardly knew anything about Slipstream when I saw it, and I came out the same way. And I don't care because Hopkins didn't do anything to make us care. There are interactive movies, and there are movies sitting in a rocking chair and knitwear, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the latter.
