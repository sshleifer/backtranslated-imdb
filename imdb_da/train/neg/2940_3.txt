I saw this movie when I was very small. It's by far the one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now I usually like weird movies, but it was just too much. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a plot for the movie. If that's something, it starts out as Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to save their new friend, Babette. There follows madness. There is the greedy, Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing shows tunes that everyone has just made the movie. Also, I can't help but feel that Babette is annoying and a little too whiny. She certainly doesn't help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, although I didn't like this movie, there were a few cute parts. I liked the camel's song. Although it was a song about being lonely, it had a friendly feel to it. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most of Looney's were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little dirt that did Dr. Evil for a serious villain. There was also Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for little boys who wanted to act hard. But honestly, even these things didn't make the movie better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) While I personally would not recommend this movie, I must admit it has its charming moments. See it if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
