If you like to be entertained, don't watch this movie. If you like watching warlords, don't watch this movie. If you like watching good acting and an excellent script, don't watch this movie. If you like typical Hollywood war movies ending in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I am always interested in war movies, because I believe that if they do well, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a bunch of guys running around the country, saying terrible clich√©s, doing the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the same exact power and brutality given to the oppressed. This movie is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the United States! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa or another country and seeing it here, being told this is how the Americans really are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, don't waste your time on this piece of junk; If you have to, wait and rent it. 4.10
