Herculis Puaro is generally a well-established 'hero', we know books and movies well. This movie or story doesn't work and I didn't feel Agatha's mistake. The players are not good, the actors are over exaggerated and make silly movements, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arabian clothes) looks fake and to the serious spectator who thinks twice that this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actress playing Herculis Puaro does a good job, but nothing fantastic. As mentioned, the scenes are perfect and look fake. The story is not very enchanting, though a mystery of murder, but who cares about the death of a loony and evil blonde 45+ woman in the Iraq desert?! 'The victim' does not like.
