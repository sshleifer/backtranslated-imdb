This could be a cute movie for kids. My grandson saw it once. He saw it on another occasion when I looked at him a little. <br /> <br /> When the little bear is lost on the ice bridge and he is in the water, he tries to get a piece of ice it says "Come back stupid ass baptism". <br /> <br /> I don't want my 3 year old grandson to watch movies with words like this in it. That's why it's rated for children. Must be child-friendly. That's what I would expect. Set out by the warner brothers and G rated I would expect this to not have cuss words in it. The words don't even fit the movie in most places, as it seems added later. And the film pulls out in many parts.
