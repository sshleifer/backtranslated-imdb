This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be a more recognized cinema area (like Vancouver's rise to prominence). The brothers were shot in Central Florida, and this short film is a bit of a backlash for the area (which made great progress with the indie film Walking Across Africa and the big HBO miniseries from Earth to Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new spin to the 'Boy Band' craze. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But the brothers fall short enough due to a weak manuscript. Both protagonists are flat with almost no development (part of this can be amateur actors, but some of it is definitely the way the script was written). Also a problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they come for fun the first time, but it grows to be a bit boring). Some of the 'concert' scenes are made bad (and many of these scenes also don't seem to move the story together in any way). <br /> <br /> I had great hopes for this, but unfortunately its a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the upcoming function based on this short one. But I think the best thing about the film maker John Figg is moving to different genres (fast). Comedy is not his strong suit. But it is undeniable that he is certainly one of the more prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that he is just now infamous, not famous). <br /> <br />
