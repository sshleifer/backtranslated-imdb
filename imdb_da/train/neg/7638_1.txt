I couldn't even get to see this movie at the end. I can't comment on the story as I didn't see the whole movie and the reason I couldn't see it was because of the 'actors'. Firstly, they mostly looked stiff, and I'm sure their scripts were in their hands just outside the frame - but that's a minor problem. The most important question I have with the actors is not really their fault ... it's the one who throws this movie! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought casting people in their late twenties to play teens went out of fashion with new wave ?! I can't see a movie where one of the first lines, from an adult man older than myself, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Don't be the victim of this movie, go out for 90 minutes and get far more than this movie ever could.
