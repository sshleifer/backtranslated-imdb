The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I've seen may have the most thrilling plot line deal with the pristine female reporter examining the white slavery / prostitution racket that takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her own hometown, New York! The film is mixed with former veterans of the series who inexplicably play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (shown here as head of a UN Committee for Third Countries countries!), Karin Shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (who Rassimov's driver). Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite being shown in the night's death), it is heavily edited and a special graphic scene (described in "Stracultr), where an Asian slave trader gets his comedy by being sodomized by a dog, there is nowhere to look here! Still a toughening sequence late in the movie when a creeping politician tricks a couple of girls (including of course Gemser and Shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a group of pimples (it is such that he gets their voices, get it!) - with his high society pals giddily looking at - seems pretty intact. <br /> <br> The most ridiculous element in this post - except Gems is a tendency to to indulge completely every time she enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her outing to India to interview a charlatan / guru (George Eastman seems to see significant Christlike!) who have found their way to prolong coitus indefinitely of course corpse when Emanuelle calls him up on it, he ends up with premature ejaculation ... !!
