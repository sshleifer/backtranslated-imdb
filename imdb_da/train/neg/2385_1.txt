I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry to check it out. She became embarrassing and the movie just has this weird plot if that's what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird, and Jellybean just sits on a toilet that both sleeps with this old man in the mountains, what happens? I have never been so dissatisfied with my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe the actors agreed to make such a waste of film, money, time and space. If Sissy was 'pretty', don't come to me. I thought she was everything but that. These thumbs were just stupid, and why do we break if she can hitchhike? WHAT IS THE POINT ??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll does not have a 0, does not even deserve a 1. Hopefully Rain is better in other movies, I forgive her for this one show, I think I would not do much better with that movie.
