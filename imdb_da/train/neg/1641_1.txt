This movie is not fun. It's not entertaining. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it cause you to take the least interest in the characters or situation. Added to that, it's about as a youth movie as something in recent memory. It is as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school children who had never met or had any relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their wrong fantasies about what an adult man would be like. This movie is boring, unpleasant mind-numbing, and sometimes offensive and disgusting. It contains a maximum of one or two moments that make you laugh. It also works twice as long as its 85 minute duration.
