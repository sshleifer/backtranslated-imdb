I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in $ 1.00 bin at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was "Stephen Foster's story", being a musician and music educator, I had to see it. I didn't know what year it was made for it didn't say on the cover, just it was a remake of the 1939's "Sewanee River". Bill Shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! I find it hard to believe in Stephen Foster that music publishers made him benefit by publishing his songs ... without paying him for them! In addition to the ridiculous view, there is an almost 20-minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black-faced "Christy Minstrels" performing Stephen Foster's hard-to-watch songs. I can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to revive in our present day. It is a nuisance and should remain forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will never be forgotten .... Eileen Christy's portrayal of Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point in Hollywood history.
