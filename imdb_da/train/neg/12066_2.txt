Okay, how's that for the original? This means that rich old geezer leaves his property to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers and two sinister servants, provided they spend the week in their spooky old house. What happens that night will only surprise those who haven't seen a movie or TV show before. After a series of murders where the victims look as if they are bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twist that ends. The cast led by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their pay slips. There are also a few levels of actors that stood at the time but long forgotten now. As a result, the movie generates the entire drama and mystery of an episode of "Matlock." I'll give credit where it's due - the closing scene is smart and entertaining if you're still awake.
