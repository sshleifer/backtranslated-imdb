Certainly I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until the scent of a woman where he apparently exaggerated himself irreparably. I was hoping for this movie that I had heard almost nothing grow up would be a lovely little gem. An overlooked, up-to-date, intelligent and engaging urban political thriller. It is not. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a movie that shoots its plot with so many characters, names, and "realistic" urban areas that for some time you think it's a plot of so wide and implicit plot that when you find out the truth, it will blow you. In fact, these subplots and downgrades ultimately result in rather tame and very well-known urban history trademarks such as power corruption, two-faced politicians, mafia with police ties, etc. The signs are safe and everything can happen! But it does it again. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that are happening are quite predictable, and we are left with several "confession" monologues intended as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in it moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spiderweb of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying revelation. I don't think we're back with it in the town hall, and even though it's a very full movie, I don't find it quite rich.
