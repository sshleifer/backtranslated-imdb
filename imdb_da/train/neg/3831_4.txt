I have to disagree with the previous comment and page with Maltin on this one. This is another sentence, too viciously western, who squeaks and groans is trying to cross its central theme of the wild west being tamed and kicked aside at the set time. It would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", but lacks the film's poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen's direction is lax, and the last 30 minutes is a real botch, with an incomprehensible strategy by hero Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a holler if you can explain to me why they set this hillside on fire.) There was something cold about the whole rape scene treatment, and the woman's reaction afterwards didn't really ring true. Coburn is very uncomfortable as the half-race fled the jail for revenge, but all his refugees are underdeveloped (they are like bowling sticks knocked down one by one as the story lurks forward). Michael Parks gives one of his typically shady, stupid, murmuring notions, but in this case, it was expedient when his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological advances can make.
