This is a rip off of the old Frankenstein premise. A recognized scientist is killed in a freakish accident, and his father stores a known brain surgeon's brain. It is then put in a robust body of its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the 'colossus' the impulse to transmit thoughts to movement. The whole project goes bad when the creation goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Special effects are undeveloped. The script is missing. And it is humorous that this is not scary a bit. Well, very young children will believe it is good. If you are totally awake in three in the morning and it comes on .... night, night. The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played 'Colossus'.
