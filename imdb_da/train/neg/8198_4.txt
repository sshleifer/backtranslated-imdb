Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or make any movie starting in Roswell sugar New Mexico. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with everything on the beach, the Andromeda tribe, the classroom scene from the Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to start. <br /> <br /> Derivatives do not even begin to describe this movie. Of course with no original plot wise do they amplify gore and sex right? Nope Gore is a blink and you miss that affair and sex is all right. (James Spader cautiously mentions that he needs a shower and the lovely Leslie Stefanson asks to join him. He turns her down. AGGH!) In fact, if a movie ever needs a shower scene for lively stuff up this is it. I mean, if you want impossible-looking women in white bathing suits that wander around an antarctic research base, why not break. <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of thrill throughout the movie Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slowly goes to a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to life it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly klich√©d work of art and has virtually no screen time for anyone sharing half of the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked as I watched what was happening with Corners children in the space scene. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame, Pinhead of Hellraiser and the Leprechaun have all traveled to space to kill nubile teenagers why not cornfield?) The characters in cornfield dress like Logan's Run extras and I just waited for stems to come live and attack them. However, it would have been exciting and apparently against this film pact. The play is mostly fine, as Spader represents his Stargate role, while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. However, John Lynch reads the entire script and works like the crazy evil guy before the story sets it. Alien Hunter is a disappointingly derived beating that makes me pine for a decent child of the maize in Rum movie.
