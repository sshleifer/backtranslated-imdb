This dates back to the matinee's days when kids with nowhere to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below. It didn't matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it. Of course, the adults will never see it. But they put it on video anyway, along with most other creaky, low-budget "B" horror flicks of the golden age ... of television. This film's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideologies (the "bad girls" harvested to replace the bad Jan's broken body - they had come), exaggerated plot (a mad scientist trying to play God), violently, but conscientious monster whose presence in the hitherto commonly occurring scientist's rural laboratory is never fully explained and which appears to polarize in wood or over-the-top. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, provided your guests enjoy adding dialogue and comment to otherwise abominable movie stocks. In fact, if you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this movie is also available on video in its "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment, where the host and dolls of the cult TV series make the necessary additions to you.
