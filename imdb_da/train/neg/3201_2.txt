Joe Don Baker is okay for good actor in small roles here and there ... he was okay in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villa in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can't do is wear a movie as the lead as he is in this extremely bad revenge movie in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escortes the killer to Italy, but some guys get the plane to lie down in Malta and the killer goes away. The rest of the movie sees Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don is being detained several times, Joe Don tortures a bartender and is interrupted and so on. The movie is pretty bad and you won't find yourself just pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be surprised how many times Joe Don the hero is taken out of a blow and how incompetent he turns out to be. The crowned part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer everywhere in Malta with the killer in a priest's dress and then they come into boats and he chases them all over Malta. This movie also has one of the worst closing lines to finish a movie ever.
