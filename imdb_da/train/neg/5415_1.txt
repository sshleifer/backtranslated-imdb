Dil was a memorable film that brings celluloid to a great instructor like Indra Kumar. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all of which were amazing. <br /> <br /> But then each successful instructor gives a couple of horrible movies along with some hits as well. Pyare Mohan is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Although the comedies are nicely told, then they fail to laugh at the viewer. Comparing with the kind of comedy film being made today is a stupid one. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, don't see this. Because the pathetic comedy only makes you cry. <br /> In short, the movie is worth a miss.
