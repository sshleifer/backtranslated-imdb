This was director von Stroheim's third effort - it is quite raw and shows none of the extraordinary flair for the camera and the editing campaign he would show a few years later with his masterworks, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. In essence, we have a trio of greats, masquerading as a Russian counter and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money on the gaming tables and win a fortune. Part of this plan is for Count (von Stroheim) to insinuate between a visiting American ambassador and his "foolish" wife, betting her and hoping to get some money playing on her weaknesses. He takes the mistake of also taking the life saving of the girl he has promised to marry. When she sees them together, she sets fire to the room (von Stroheim and his prey are on the room's balcony). Here, von Stroheim first establishes his persona as "the man you love to hate." He is thoroughly poor, and his character errors make him a very poor and deserving end. The film is raw in its film and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director. There is a sweet bit - when he first tries to meet the ambassador's wife, she reads a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. This was originally portrayed as a 210 minute movie, cut to 140 minutes of study and finally released in 70 minutes. The restoration on the Kino Video restores surviving recordings (damaged in some way in most scenes) from the alternate previous version to give us a 107 minute print.
