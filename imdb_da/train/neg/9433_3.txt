I bought Unhinged because I was suckered by the gory picture on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All the killings are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look much better in the stills than they do in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's look at the plot. A group of college girls driving to a rock concert (using the deep, dark forests in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) slips off the road. There is no visible damage to the car, but it was probably enough to put one of the characters in comatose mode for the rest of the movie (or maybe read the script and was already in coma before the movie began). <Br /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large, insulated house. By the way, the house is fantastic and controls more drama just by its presence than any of the film's actors. For some reason, this house has no path to it. The only way you can get to the main road is to walk five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting and listening to strange conversations between an old rich bitch (like George Washington in a row) and her straight domestic, sexually repressed daughter. The girls did not seem to be rushing back from that concert, yet they packed more clothes than the cast on Gilligan's Island in the three hour tour. <br /> <br /> As we, the viewers, come to Kill scenes, we no longer like. We want someone to kill us just to end our suffering. Unhinged finally encloses with a rather shocking end that deserved to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the ending, the one good idea in the movie, first written, and then the authors tried to make a movie of it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Unhinged is a boring movie with poor acting, inappropriate control and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry I'm not sure where it came from). You will get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the opening circuit when the screen image for some reason is not explained, turns black for approx. Two minutes, while the characters talk about something worth remembering. Do not waste your time. You just want to feel Unhinged and want your time and money back.
