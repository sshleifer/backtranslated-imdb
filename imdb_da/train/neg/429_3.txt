I was enticed to watch this movie of its star power, but in the end it is all it supplies. It is much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about the city's corruption. The biggest mistake is its predictability and complete lack of excitement. We know who the bad are from the beginning, and just follow as they fall as dominoes. The film for his credit does not waive free violence and sex, but forgot to replace good, pure romance or excitement in any other way. All the taste of a good, flat decaffeinated diet. "Q&A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative as it is "LA Confidential".
