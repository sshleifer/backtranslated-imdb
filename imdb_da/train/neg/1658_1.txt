This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given to the actor / director Roman Polanski. I'd rather see the three Amigos than ever see this movie again. It went straight from the DVD player straight into the trash. My excuses for those of you who apparently liked this movie, but you liked New Coke too. I'm at a loss to see why anyone would have had this movie, it's slow, boring and has no real plot. You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started. I understand this was made in 1976, but it was an era of bad television around. Thanks god disco and Three's Company have joined forces with stop sign glasses and Bay City Rollers. Oh yes my thoughts.
