This movie was amazing the first time I saw it when it was called "Lost in Translation." But somehow, Bill Murray was transformed into an eccentric black man who played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson became a fit Latin woman, played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan became Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence we've had in Translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 items that go on annoying. Instead of characters that were inventive and introspective as in Translation, we get signs that spit pointless advice on issues they have no idea. How can a sign carrying a hundred dollars T-shirts and never been in a Target workshop expect to give advice to a working class woman on how to prepare a job interview as an administrative assistant? Don't think it stops him. If he does not give her garment, he tells her what to eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how they were busy making an appointment, and yet the signs continue to find time to run another thing, whether it was washing the car, stopping at Arby or just lying around the list of their 10 objects or fewer lists of things they love and hate. I stopped shouting at them and said, "Don't you say you had a place to be? What are you doing? A moment ago you were almost delayed, now you eat beef and think of your life!" Until I saw this movie, I never really understood how something could "insist on itself," but I think this movie does just that and undeserved it. The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympathetic ?? with the exception that I felt sorry for both players for signing up for this project.
