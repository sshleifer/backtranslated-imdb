While the actor and director could be claimed to have some profit - the story is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country's name simply changed. At least for a movie to hold some credibility, try to get some pressure on equipment, weapons and tactics. Apart from the limited use as a silly propaganda about the South African defense, it serves little purpose - absolutely no entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Exciting filmmakers - this is not a war movie. Do some research and have some pride in your product.
