The orange tone to everything was just yucky. Oh yes, the protagonist lives in a ghetto that is all orange with orange people. Meanwhile, to mentally escape from this crushing poverty in the body, she plays a full-immersion video game (which sucks no rules are clear and no logic follows the game). She apparently earns an income that plays the game, but she is revealed not to be an employee of the gaming company. Lots of non-talking breaks later draw the story slowly. She uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operational interface that is so visually annoying and I can only suspect a future Microsoft release. <br /> <br /> However, I ask the viewer why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic games when she almost does not have the necessities of life? Oh yes, playing games is fun, but what's the point when you're almost starving? While she is doing her life away and playing some miserable, even more orange-toned, full-immersion video games, she runs the dog (probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention and feeds it regularly) or is stolen from the woman (while ignoring her miserable orange-toned reality). In the meantime, she has occupied some games, playing her gaming game throughout the uninteresting movie. Yawn. So she will be the best of the best, so take them Ash Catchem (to drill us all). Golly, this protagonist also sucks as a human being and has no redeeming qualities apart from her physical beauty (which she could exchange in a way to escape her crushing poverty). <br /> <br /> So she reaches the "Real" level and at least it doesn't suck at all, and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate who mentally lives in the "Real" level. Finally, the sucky boring gentle orange-toned movie is no longer a tedious task to look at, but has the potential to say something like "the protagonist is trapped in imaginary computer-generated poverty, and she is actually in the real world now". Maybe she'll make the murder and live in the real world now? Well, she kills the guy and he disappears into a digital effect. Wow! Thank you idiotic instructor. You suck, you suck so much, director. <br /> <br /> Here, the director had a chance to redeem himself by burying this miserable lama moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twist. <br /> <the director could have said, "the real world is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to do better, it will not be a cruddy orange-toned poverty country." A smart way to make this sigh-tacular movie an agonizingly slow lesson on basic civilian pride (for the 1% of viewers who have not found anything that is actually entertaining to see at this time or are movie-masochists). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to turn this all up by throwing in a spooky digital effect and destroying all the potential for redemption for this very miserable film that was a waste of money, a waste of time, and a waste of the viewer's confidence. <br /> <After that, it ends. Good riddance. I hope the director stifles it. I put this HACK on my "avoid at all cost" list for other movies his name is attached to.
