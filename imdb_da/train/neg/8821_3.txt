Why, oh, why don't they learn? When you have a good, juicy utilization gimmick, use it! Don't go around trying to get everyone deep and thoughtful; You will only look, look stupid. Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who so little too much of Mommy who kisses (Daddy-dressed-as-) Santa Claus back when he was a child So, of course, Harry grows up with Christmas and when his disillusionment becomes too great, he flips out, dress like Santa Claus and wanders the city and gives toys to good little children and maliciously kills anyone whom he considers immoral. <br /> <br /> Simple enough and not a bad place to start. (How many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this movie will be more "Santa, Portrait of a Serial Killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is used to document Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, as I would have been willing to buy the premise at the time the opening titles rolled. You know that a slasher movie is in trouble when you find yourself encouraging the killer to just move on with it already. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry's descent into madness could have been convincing in the hands of a competent director, but, alas, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently this is his only movie and it shows. The action jumps gidily from scene to scene without creating shots or clear views from the actors to tell us where we are and who we see. Even when the movie rolls, we are still being treated to heaping the help of Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. More depressing than scary, Christmas evil is one to avoid.
