The opening scenes move as fluidly as the frozen velvet. Attempting dramatic dialogue only makes me have better control over speed control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy obnoxious creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. I usually count a body count, so there was a cat (who doesn't count) a bum, a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her (whatever it went) and then plotted. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting an apple for a vampire to bite a victim is simply stupid. I liked Warlock, but this movie was just so bad that we broke it off and it was so forgotten that we rented it a year later to just turn it off again.
