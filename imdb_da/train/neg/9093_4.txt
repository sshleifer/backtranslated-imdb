I've seen this movie for the first time today, and I've never heard of it before, probably because of the bad news. <br /> <br /> First of all, the management itself is quite good, the players played well, and CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is magnificent. But that alone does not make a movie. No story at all, no message behind beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or do I have to remind people that art from an instructor is not just your vision but knowing how to tell a story. And that's what is missing all 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple 4 rating.
