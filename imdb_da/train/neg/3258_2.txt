DOC SAVAGE: THE BRONZE MAN (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Terrible, horrible movie ... based on the mass magazine / paperback series of Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a super- heroic adventure hero in the 30s and his five assistants, all experts in any attempt that allows them to fight evil. It was a beautiful hokey series ... but a little fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the 70s, star Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never got the chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on television. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can understand why. The reason and the characters are never dealt with seriously ... it's all in the form of heavy-in-kind and campy ... just like the old Batman TV series ... just without being funny ... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, stupid stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad plays. In fact, I find it a little fascinating in its evil ... what could they have thought of? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumored to be the lead in a modern remake ... but I don't think it would have been much better.
