It's not just that this is a bad movie; It's not just that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers are in this movie; And it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... great time. This people wastes money in horrible scripts. It must make a criticism of Mexican society, but we are tired of this kind of film. Should bad language be fun? I do not understand it. Mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movie continues to play (and is being written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think this kind of movie is well received in Mexico: We hate them and they do not reflect us.
