Being a big fan of the "other" PLANET of the APES movies, I rented this DVD despite my reluctance to do anything about Tim Burton. Once again he fails to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even monkey makeup looks second rate, which is unforgiving given the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg once proves that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I was embarrassed by real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. There was no doubt that their payslips motivated them as it could not have been the clich√©-ridden manuscript. I rented this DVD on a special $ 1 night and I still feel ripped off.
