The French film "Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte" directed by iconoclast filmmaker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial author Michel Houellebecq. He has also worked on the film's scenario. According to British cinema magazine Sight and sound, it is also known as "whatever". This film has been hailed as a fresh air for French cinema because of its not so common theme of sexual policy and its implications for two stupid information technology workers. the film is mistreated by its obvious voice over which introduces us to the protagonist. This causes us viewers to feel as though we are seeing a book that comes with reading. The basic prerequisite for problems associated with loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine, but the film goes out of hand when the hero begins to tell the misery that he and his friend are facing. Instead of sticking to the main subject, the film goes in other directions to its downfall. Beware: some women viewers may find not only the movie but even their two heroes as moronic misogynists.
