This movie was so ridiculous that I had never even finished seeing it. I actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it on the DVD from the movie store. This movie made me sick, not because it was gory, but because I wasted 2 50 on it !!!! It looks like my brother and I went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited the slaughterhouse recordings in it! I'm so ticked off, even though BTK Killer deserves more credit than it wasn't exactly I mean, came on the headline was of course made by the game dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG, I can't even get all the words to explain it DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!
