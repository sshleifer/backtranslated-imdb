This was recently on AMC's lively movie classics, and I had to laugh. I had great hopes for this adventure that goes in the way of "Voyage to Earth's Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed not only in the working credentials, but in the stupid story line that comes from a five-year cartoon. Be sure to see the wires that hold onto Pterdactyl's wings when they understand "Ogar" a half-idiot premodern man who turns to the lost adventurers. The end left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in "People that Time Forgot". Do not waste your time.
