The really sad thing is that this was apparently the highest budget "Halestorm Entertainment" has had to work with. All involved should be fined for waste, as all the cellulosics they spilled are good at nothing more than filling the waste. Not only is the writing terrible and the jokes awful, but the camera's work and movie quality are at best amateur. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptops. The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing. I just think I couldn't believe I actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I watched had actually agreed to show "movies".
