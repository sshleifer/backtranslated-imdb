FLY OF FURY takes the cloak to be the VERY WORST Steven Seagal flick I've ever seen ... So far. <br /> <br /> It is a horrible drilling without any action scenes of any interest, Seagal is not really trying in this - he is bold and his voice is dubbed again. <br /> <br /> The co-stars are no better as they are a rather upset load of 3. Raters. <br /> <br /> The Direction of Keusch is very poor, and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another pair of Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) The play written by Seagal himself is ridiculously unscathed. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb $ 12M was spent on this dull load of old tosh - If these numbers are correct, I feel a big tax spree as nowhere near that amount was used. <br /> <br /> FLUG OF FURY is actually a shot to shot remake by Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this tripe. <br /> <br /> This has no redeeming features at all, Give it a MISS! 1/2 * out of *****
