This is a really horrible movie. The reason (as it is) is completely unpretentious. (I think it has something to do with extortion, but I'm not quite sure.) Half of the dialogue consists of useless clich√©s. The other half is spoken by the various actors in such incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents, which (fortunately) the words cannot be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the only true tragedy in the movie is that such a historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore apparently was in such serious economic or personal circumstances that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
