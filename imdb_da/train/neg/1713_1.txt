If you haven't seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you don't. A contest that "make your own horror movie in a day" might not come up with an entrance than this assault of an insult to any seer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets forgot a story, a plot, a proper dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC shopping talent and the credited lighting designer of course forgot to show up. It seems to be recorded on the most beautiful of handycams, and copied on even worse equipment. Make-up effect consists of black mascara for zombies and yogurt poured over people's heads to simulate their skin melting. This is no more than a home video and also a really bad one. Only fun to look for friends, family members and neighbors who were willing to show up for the movie. I can't understand for my life why this mockery of a product is listed in any serious movie magazine or site - I have home theater weddings that are far better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same nonsense.
