I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig as I attended the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. But I was eager to get my heel out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig consists of several "big rig" drivers who have stated that they deliver goods driven over the US. The characters are all wonderful people, but the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as humans. Instead, the story tells as much as the cards in the film are meant to guide, but never do. At most we are lost. We - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the story of history, but end up without direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The storytelling is sloppy, and the directors' intention to "humanize" a group of people whom they regard as "overlooked" and "invisible" comes across unconscious and annoyingly discouraging. The problem here lies in the directors' perspective instead of the truck drivers. The executives make their own naive assumptions about truckers' forward-looking and then simply editing the movie to confirm these assumptions. All in all, the thrill is missing the story, the film is far too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of "So what" is never answered, and the whole movie is a transparent propaganda that does nothing to further "enlighten" (as the directors claim) the outside world about big riggers.
