Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a huge safety pin ....... These are the words that best describe this horrible movie. I love cheesy horror movies, and I've seen hundreds ... but it had to be the worst ever made. The plot is paper-thin and ridiculous, the play is an abomination, the manuscript is completely ridiculous (the best is the final principle with the policeman and how he worked out who the killer is - it's just so terribly written), the clothes are sick and fun in equal measure, the hair is great, lots of breasts jumps, men carry the carved tee shirts that show their stomachs (diseases that men actually had them!) and the music is just synthesizer garbage bin that over and over ... in almost every scene There are trashy music, breasts and paramedics who take away bodies .... and the gymnastics still doesn't close for grief! All the fun aside this is a really bad movie whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then.
