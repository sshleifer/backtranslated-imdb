Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the protagonist's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make her seem drunk. But just before she is killed, she tells her sister's business partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she hasn't had a drink in 4 days. But the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! And they talked about her being full when she fell down the stairs. Huh? Really bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty terrible in general. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly poor, considering the great cast. Some errors: The writing is not very good, the music is made for TV, and there are no tensions, because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene in the movie.
