I rented this movie for a couple of laughs. I had never seen the SNL dirty, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World it couldn't have been that bad, could it? The answer: It was. This movie was hardly a means of relaxing after a hard day's work. I just kept waiting for a plotline and a fun part, but there wasn't anyone. The highlight was tiffany amber Thieson, and that's just about it.
