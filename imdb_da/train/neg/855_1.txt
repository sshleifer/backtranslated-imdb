Not the best of the movies to be seen today. I read many reviews about Shining and expected it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and the environment were good, but there was no history here. There wasn't a single moment of scare. I was expecting a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. The only scene I was scared of was during the chapter change scene that showed "Wednesday". There are many fragments in the film. Most of the things are inexplicable with nothing to link it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes shown. Can be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
