Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his bossy fianc√©, Kate (Eva Longoria) see last minute events for their reception. It's the morning of their wedding, and Kate is in a frenzy that gives caterers a tenderness about her food presentation requirements. But the horror of horror, the "English" ice sculpture commissioned by Kate arrives without wings. In a subsequent battle with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" girl falls on Kate and sends her to the following. Now a year later, Henry's sister organizes a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have liked him to start dancing other ladies and move on. Still, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) interested in Henry herself, becomes much to her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create chaos for Ashley as she has no intention of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can something be done to return Kate to heaven for good? This is a scary romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan ever saw. No, it's not thrown as they try to get things done. Longoria is beautiful and fun as the indulgent fiance, and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is also contagious. Biggs, a fun thespian, is also completely wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please thank you) he tries hardest of all, and in fact is the main reason for seeing this clunker. His charm, appearance and easy humor go a long way in making the movie bearable. But nothing can make a thoughtless script and terrible direction to a winner, absolutely nothing. So if you are a colored-in-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over the money for this. Even though free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near death experience for those who love love and laughter cinema.
