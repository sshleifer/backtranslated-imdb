I think I saw this movie, but I do not quote as I might have fallen asleep to see it as it did not "grab my excitement and imagination". I know at least I saw enough of knowing that I won't see it again soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about lame ... Really lama. Totally lamb. It would not even appeal to a six year old. It basically had no worthy dramatic impact. Zilch. Nada. Just shlock turned into a drunk. Comedy? It should be comedy? Ya coulda fooled me-ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if foreigners had been insatiably carnivorous as in the movie "Critters", we could have made human characters do something a little more deeply than being excessively smugly cutesy ... like shouting and screaming and running for their lives so they would not be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than seeing paint dry. Don't bother to see this. It's not worth it. You can find something more interesting to do. Like to see paint dry. Or fall asleep.
