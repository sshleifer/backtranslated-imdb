So I had heard from a few people that this movie had brought them to tears in the theater. As I saw it for the first time, I was expecting another romantic, tear-shaving Barbra Streisand movie; Something like the way we were. I was definitely wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was non-existent, making it impossible to attach the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic addict who could not sing a single note without making me fast forward. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman, and she forgives him about. five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the movie seemed to pull on and off, and I kept asking myself when it was going to end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was quite obviously foreshadowing his ruthless behavior early in the film, and when he died, I didn't feel any sense. It wasn't a tragic accident, he was basically an idiot. Not to mention the whole movie, I was distracted by his fate beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this movie worth seeing are Streisand songs. The end of the movie when she sings "With One More Look at You / Watch Closely Now" was my reason to give this movie a huge 3/10. The 7 minutes was the only part of the movie, I actually felt a different feeling than irritation and anger.
