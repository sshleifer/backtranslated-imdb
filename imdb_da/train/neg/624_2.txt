In the Bag-the-Scenes feature, the director says he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically dedicating this movie to the big directors is like giving your mom a piece of sh * t for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. CAST PEOPLE WHO CAN DO. Also don't throw a person who is 40 years old to the role of a misunderstood 18-year recluse. That's right he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions of people as they see their lovers get their hearts skinned out are entertaining. Or as a part when a guy gets stuck in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it) and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh .. my .. God?" The bird scare itself is right in nature. Make flip off cars and call people losers. <br /> <br /> The movie has a redeeming factor ... Oh wait, no it doesn't. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely want to watch this movie, just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a real gnarly song guy.
