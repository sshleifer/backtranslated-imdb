In some ways the concept behind the story was a rather interesting mix of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. No point in this movie was so obvious that it didn't deserve bad close-ups. I felt as if I had been beaten over with the so-called mystical explanation of the disease that killed humans. The writer just seems to lift clich√©s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. The actors did not help. No chemistry. I suppose they should develop some kind of attraction if only because that is an essential element of these stories. But the authors did not work very hard to develop chemistry. Of course, they are both attractive, but if they are attractive to each other, it seemed to be an open question. <br /> <br /> Confidence Turner's character shows in Sabato are developed too quickly and without special reason. Sabato's character must be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character in "Independence Day." Usually, that kind of character should show any kind of talent or shine. Sabato's character does not. He is Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic abilities of a magical eight ball. He seems to be right by chance chance. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are comical. Every actor really tried more than a little too hard to demonstrate the pain that was inflicted on them. The symptoms looked like bad claymation, like the video from the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
