Well, let me start by saying how completely HILARIOUS this movie is, I simply couldn't keep from laughing at the sheer stupidity. Don't make me wrong, it's acting well, especially by Bassinger, but the script is just good, the mind is really boggled. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is good and until Della actually testifies to the murder, it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill. Halfway through the film, the protagonist pulls out of his toolbox and, of course, instead of lobbing it on the guy's head, she decides to pull a screwdriver, car jack and finally a flare (as for a sinking ship) to kill her victims. <br /> <br /> Then there is the final line that I promise if it doesn't have you in stitch, then I will eat my own left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to those who just want to laugh at some good old-fashioned, scary filmmaking. May I also suggest that you watch the scene in the scrap yard with the guy who falls from one foot's high shovel, gets me every time.
