The last song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, it's all positive I can say about this Western movie. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there are more than 8 lines horrible in this western. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a spoof. The hero and villain of this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all. Many of the supporting actors in this movie were so authentic, but shooting scenes was a joke. A former commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot on President Bush. This was not a democratic or Republican Western. It was just a poor western movie to be sold commercially. I wonder if it made any money. At times, I thought I saw a movie made by college film students. If so, it was a great movie.
