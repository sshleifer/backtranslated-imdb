A sentimental school drama in Denmark, 1969, "We must overcome" offers a pathetic Danish practice of American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a floral gas obsession, naive 13-year-old, goes out with half-ear hanging from the brother's sister Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding) office. Lindum-Svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant, has the local community in control. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far this time, and with her father, who has come back from a mental breakdown (surely there was not enough drama already ..) and far too stereotypical hippie music teacher Svale ('Hello, call me Freddie') , Frits stands up for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell you what. It is so convincing, over- (method-) acted, and then followed by misery, that as a "family" image this grotesque-filled with clich√©'s excuse for a movie does not fail to convince the non-Scandinavian audience. Sorry, friendly Danish readers, to collapse like this in your sentimental travels. But it is certainly not a tale of a "boy being a man fighting the system". The boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eye screaming face. If you call a church of small-proofed small-towners, led by a dictator like the comic character "system", I regret if I lack something. <br /> <br /> If you are into family photos, please see Happy Feet instead ..
