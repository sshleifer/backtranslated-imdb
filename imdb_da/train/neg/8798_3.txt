I like a movie that at least has a history story. This does not happen in this movie. It is a series of vignettes without context. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blonde pearl never removes her sunglasses. This woman shoots at other people at the start of the movie and we never find out why. She disappears completely after approx. 30 minutes. There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes at a fast food collection where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is pretty much overplayed (I used to like the song). The dialogue is mainly affected by food (pineapple, chef's salad and ordering of drinks ??). I suppose most of the actors won under this movie because much fast food was used. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is supposedly a romance - it's not such a thing. I just wonder why I didn't hit Fast-forward. I kept waiting for something important to happen ?? It doesn't. Perhaps it's the only consolation for this movie - scenes shifted so fast that it tricked you into assuming there would be a revelation for all nonsense.
