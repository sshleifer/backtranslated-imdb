This movie is a modest bet by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this movie. Get on the bus while apparenly anti racist, do nothing but berate white and break down the black status quo. The basis of this movie is about a group of black men traveling on a bus to the Louis Farrakhan's million man's march. The bus has every type of person you could imagine: gay, Muslim, gangbang and uncle Tom (he is thrown away from the bus). There was one white person on the bus. He was accused of being racist the moment he got on the bus to drive. Despite being a Jew and the fact that he explained the situation, he ended up being racist and leaving the bus. I hate to say so, but movies like this need to realize their own hypocrisy and rationing of steroids. This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment. You may think I'm racist to write this, but I mean well. Better luck next time Spike.
