If you want to see a movie about two completely unsympathetic characters, this is the one. The action is fantastic, both from John Cassavetes as the crazy paranoid, who, as I said, says they really are getting out, and from Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns to rescue. Big mistake, but since they are both amoral mobsters and misogynist bastards to start, it is difficult to determine who will root for LESS. Only author / director Elaine May could have gotten away with this. I thought it interesting that in a longer interview with the producer Michael Hausman on the DVD he stated that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the manuscript, that the director was almost impossible to work with that director of photography had impossible demands from him that the crew was constantly angry to be made to sit waiting and so on. This mood of a large, highly dysfunctional family is evident on the screen.
