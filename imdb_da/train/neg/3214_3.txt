First of all, I would like to tell you that I am involved in comics, animations, animations and such things. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. I want to be objective. To begin with, the story - it's okay. Follow the line of history of the comics as far as I know them. But the animation ... Well it's actually not terrible, but it's certainly cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and adhere to the original cartoon style drawings. If we pretend to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightning strike, you may know that the film is made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell of a lot better! Besides this, the talents don't make anything remarkable, the music is nothing special. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I saw it, but I can't tell I really enjoyed it. It just doesn't catch you. There is plenty of blood and violence, but it doesn't impress me at all. Perhaps it will be shocking to anyone who has never seen more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is anyone around?), But I don't think it's the audience for this movie. So they could add some nudity and spice to it. The chickens around Lucifer were pretty tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death myself! There are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better, you might want to take the original heavy metal, heavy metal torch 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
