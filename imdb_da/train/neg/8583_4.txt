The Americans have a fruit flight's excitement, and if nothing happens in a typical trading market, we tend to lose interest really quickly. <br /> <br /> I found out an exciting fact from this movie: someone has to paint high voltage toolbars and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they really want to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). Surprisingly, when I was sad to see late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this movie, I found that sign to be interesting and very engaging. <br /> <br /> I usually do not watch so much late night television, so I cannot recommend this movie unless you see paint daring is your idea of ​​an exciting two hours out of your life.
