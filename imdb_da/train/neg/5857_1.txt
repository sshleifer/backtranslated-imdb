WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was among the worst events in 2001. Perhaps its biggest mistake was the fact that it did not follow most of the previous Survivor Series. There was only one surviving series battle. And the Survivor Series match lasted 45 minutes. In addition, anyone with a functioning brain will know that it would end up with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock that apply to his team. And don't get me started on the pre-event before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one was going to die. There was no need for all the meaningless hype. Whatever the story, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of the fighting: The first match was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast paced battle and it was good to see a heel win a fight fair. William Regal vs. Tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. The Edge vs. Test was good, but nothing good. Tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. The fight Royal continued for 10 minutes and no one was really worried about who would win in the first place. The women's title fight was not great. No, not at least. The main event must have been the most hypocritical struggle in history. The Alliance lost but guess what after 5 months every Alliance superstar returned. The fight itself was poor. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. The rock was also trapped with his play to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who threatened the whole fight. If I wanted someone 2 eliminated at first, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker just fell down guys. 7 games are not enough for a Survivor series. If ever there is a Survivor Series as bad as this again, I will
