This movie only got one 1 because you can't give a zero! IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE TODAY, THAT ALL DO NOT SEE. expensive rights people you do not want to see either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witness it happen! The only cool parts are the case and the fact that it is a true story. It's really really super creepy that this guy was working on ADT while killing people! Still Feel Safe When You Turn In The Little Code? I dont do that! He had access to any code in Kansas !!!!!! I hated the movie, it wasn't scary, it was mentally scary! Do yourself a favor and don; t rent / buy this movie i think it costs about $ 20 to make it including their OVER paid actors !!!!
