This movie is a mess. I'm surprised it even has a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video. It's badly written. It is badly directed. It's worse insult is that it has taken an interesting subject and reduced it to a ridiculous and vibrant thriller that has no excitement and no excitement and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the film enters a series of ridiculous sets. It is so over the top that the audience I saw it laughed at it. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it's not exciting and there's no excitement - in fact, the movie's really worst offense is that it's just boring.
