Before I watched this movie, I could already tell that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanted someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs). MJH's name for a movie would typically turn me away (uh, can we say GROSS?!), But I still wanted to try it. <br /> <br /> From the start, I was a little interested. The action is absolutely horrible, and I shot myself by almost every reaction from the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even the worst, but I continued to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end was the biggest joke of them all! I was seriously in shock thinking "It was the end?! Is this a comedy?!". I thought this pile of shit was more fun than the "Scary Movie" spokes, and it really says something!
