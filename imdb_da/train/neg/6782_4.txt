Not one of Keatson's best efforts, this was perhaps a blatant attempt to avenge the family, he married in - Talmadges. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences lead Buster to a marriage with a large Irish woman who (with her father and brothers) rarely treats him until they believe he can be a heir to a fortune. Misunderstood identities exist in the surface - gags are created, but for the main fail to pay. <br /> <br /> This Metro card has at least two real laughs - Buster carefully throws his lack of dinner using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate. The other is a family photo, where the whole group slowly collapses to the floor, as the stand in the camera loses its stability. The Gærøl River could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built on gags, but stops short (for the whole construction) of the development. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Busters best efforts, but worth having a little laugh.
