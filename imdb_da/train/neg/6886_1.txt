John Heder was horrible in this movie. I felt like I saw a poor college kid act for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was the couple for the course, not good but not terrible (plus she is sweet). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (although it was also badly judged by his side). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will always be stuck in the typical role of "dorky kid" unless he does something SERIOUS work on his plays.
