Although the start suggests All Quiet on the West Front, this stupid and superficial version of war falls far away from its much better contemporary. This shows the funniest war ever fought, with the first and a half hours devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see some kind of blow, it's the lamb: An enemy plane flying over? Shoot it down (in a shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he gets a shot. Enemies soldiers in the forest? Don't worry, surrender them with pleasure. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, Turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
