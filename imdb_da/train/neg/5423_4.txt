I've been using IMDb for a few years now, but have never written any reviews before. However, this movie disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing), which I could not keep quiet anymore. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so disturbed by noise pollution that he assumes an alter ego as a vigilante, "The Rectifier," and vandalizes any car he finds with a car alarm. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the movie is a mistake. Although there are one or two cases of other noise sources being treated or mentioned, our main character's only true focus is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the film tries to attach other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to make a profit for the actions of Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have the inner urge to take a baseball bat for a screaming vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and just about the fact of selling this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly constructed sexual relationship (including a completely inevitable triangle), which is, of course, being thrown in for the movie gates that need such things thrown in to enjoy a movie. It's really eye-rolling. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very short in the movie, becomes completely incomparable. It seems less he does not decide to stop noise anymore, and more so by focusing so much on the noise he has started to lose his hygiene. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, car-based guy in this hero of the little guy, The Rectifier. However, the transformation does not take place. He just renames himself. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social comments come in now and then to add to the movie's pretentiousness, and the self-satisfied smirk that never completely leaves Robbin's face doesn't help either. All in all, I think it is very obvious what this film is trying to be, since it has largely pushed down the throat, but in my opinion it fails in a big way. Just a guy's opinion, toast.
