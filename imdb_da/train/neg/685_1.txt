My wife and I thought the movie with this cast and instructor should be worth the least. We were wrong. In fact, we gave it up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British, but talking to American accents, was impossible for me to pass by - hard to believe, it's England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to repeat an earlier comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love to each other for no reason is ridiculous. There is no need to worry about any of the characters, so we threw the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that the Hawks instructed this as none of the actors spoke with the Hawksian rat-a-tat brand. So save your time and skip this one.
