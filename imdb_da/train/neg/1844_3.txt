Personally, I think this show looks pretty cheap. Some of the actors are terrible. They over do it & seem fake. I can always tell how it will end within the first 10 minutes or less to see because they make it so transparent. It is also not very well written. I love to watch it laugh. You know the saying "It's so bad it's good?" Well, that says apply to this show. I also like to look just to see if I'm right when I guess how it all ends. So far I have been right every time. It's like a little game I play. It's nice when you're bored and you want to laugh at something.
