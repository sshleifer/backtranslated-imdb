This film is made for Asian / Chinese market, targeting especially fans of Jay Chou, one of the greatest music stars in Asian. Jay Chou is a very talented songwriter / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he appeared in several major budget productions ("initial D", "curse of the golden flower"). Amazingly, he won both Golden Horse (Taiwan) and Hong Kong movie prizes for "initial D". <br /> <br /> The support supports are very well chosen, which largely appeals from China. Cast with many famous film / TV actors, singers, even sports commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). But they didn't have enough time to show their talents. The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both director and author position. He has a reputation for making superficial and brainless movies based on non-coherent scripts. With his bad direction and lame story, the entire talented cast, fancy visions and tones of production money were wasted. <br /> <br /> But the horrible movie was successfully paid over $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asian, making this one of the biggest box office success in Asian. The bottom line is: You can only watch this movie if you want to see how money and talents are wasted or if you are simply accompanying your children, fans of Jay Chou.
