This film deals mainly with Inspector Gadget's arch-nemesis Doctor Claw, which after many years has returned to the now peaceful town of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to fold the gadget once and for all by using a newer "cooler" crimefighter to help destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without Don Adams voice as Inspector Gadget, it just doesn't mow; Dr. Claw is not only visually less intimidating, but sounds more like a strangler than his original scary self. Permitted this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (the sky forbids I mention the animation) that it pales in relation to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny to bring her up to two decades, she now has some quasi-punk rebellious clothing style and doesn't play half the role she did in the television series. The gadget mobile, as well as include a plot angle that focuses entirely on talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show that has grown up, but I thought the live-action version was more painful than I could carry, but now they go and spring this complete watering of the quality TV series on U.S. It's more than I can take.
