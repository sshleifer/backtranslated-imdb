When you get your hands on a British movie, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; This movie does the business. It is made by highly trained craftsmen. It alone can give you a fun one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you will find nothing. Besides making you feel good and advocating drug trafficking, there's really nothing there. The scripture is mediocre, the plot is predictable, and the end must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all, it's English beauty, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea, except to make money of course.
