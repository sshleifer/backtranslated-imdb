Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. A pretty good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly, but got speed in the way of having a pretty good finish, as the anchor woman changed to a cute werewolf that was only shot down on the camera. Yes it made it an entertaining horror movie to be sure ... well, forget about it, as this movie has nothing to do with that movie. Oh, they make it clear that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is out to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they have to fight evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee did in this movie, but I read trivia here, saying he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still reading the script before taking a role. Perhaps you could have got into "A US werewolf in London" hell that could have been possible. After all, it was in London. Hi, werewolves do not seem to count much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie was for me when one gal began to speak loudly, and one of the guys' ears began to bleed.
