It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw dropping in, how terrible it is. Turning off the DVD player was not a sufficient action. I want to find the people who are responsible for this disaster and turn them around the face. I will never get that time back. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and soulless movie? I couldn't think of a course of action that would alleviate the tedium. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful piece of cinema. What more can you say than repeat how truly horrible the play is. Please avoid.
