I found this a good movie to pass your time but not without any chance of any historical value. The depiction of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The fact's twist is ... fun! She gave birth while she was feeding her people!?!? O please ... A pregnant queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother going from one room to another for that reason! They tried to make her become a saint for God's sake! And how they tried to justify her murdering her own sister ... beyond the description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based on anything but her feelings and morals. She did everything for just two reasons: Power and self-preservation! She was carried in a family where she had to choke to survive, something she did very well. Everything that was going on was either murdered (her brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill and also ... gay gay. So, he was her end ...
