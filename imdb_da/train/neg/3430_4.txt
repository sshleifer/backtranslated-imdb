A bloody lunatic with cannibalist tendencies rapes a woman. He has been shot by two police officers, and then he has risen from the grave because of a kind of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by a vicious heresy. Hunting for women continues with this zombie demon. The victimized baby returns from the grave and wants madness again, but only with the help of the police gets it right ... <br /> <br /> A bloody 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies, doll -babies, S & M, corrupt and winding police officers, reverse heretics who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three text screens at the end of the film explain to us what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we should know!) ... Two decent disemboweling shots can't save the situation. I've seen worst horror flicks, but this one was pretty bad too. Recommended only to the very bad fans of the genre.
