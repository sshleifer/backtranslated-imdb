I've been a fan since his first album. This movie is a bad service for him. The performances, with the exception of one of Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply awful. <br /> <br /> Those of Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even the McGarrigle sisters were destroyed by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I have never seen my wife stand up and leave the room on a movie before, and I quickly found relay through performances to get to the few interview segments which were also difficult to see due to of the bad camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many who have been able to interpret Mr. Cohn's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville, and Willie Nelson who come to mind, but the people chosen for this show were just awful. Hopefully there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen on films that will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
