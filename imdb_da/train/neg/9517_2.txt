Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet me in st. Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I await this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is the scene after the stage of nowhere fatalism. Sinatra is a sad bag, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing floozy hang on him living in disappointing tombs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. The film has a great dramatic finish, where a disappointing villain is associated with Sinatra and MacClane, and something disappointing happens. The sequence is meant to be voltage-filled, but Minelli is not a Hitchcock; he is so distracted by beautiful colors, he does not notice that the scene is a hissing clich√©, and the characters are so thin and poorly developed that we are not particularly aware of their being shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real filmography in the project. Otherwise we look at constipated signs standing around bars and living rooms to get on each other's nerves for two hours. Hell is other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to repression and indifference after World War II is handled more gently in 'The Best Years of Our Life'. And one of two Inge products, 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being caught in a blind city with much more poignance.
