I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman on it, so it seemed promising. And that was until Justin Timberlake came on stage. He's a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he's one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no feelings on any of his lines. Why the hell was he thrown to Josh Pollack's role? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in the Se7. It may sound cool, but believe me, it's not. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's play is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. However, he has some really nice lines. <br /> <br /> However, the story was good, although it was a bit clear and exaggerated. I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing happened.
