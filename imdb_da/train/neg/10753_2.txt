Share - "You're the stupidest smart person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in the rewrites." <br /> <I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed. In the books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists to think through a problem. Here she is just a lady in need and waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are references to Asimov's Robots Laws, but they are an afterthought for CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith likes as he is in most of his movies, but honestly, the story isn't that good. You will find out long before these genius characters do.
