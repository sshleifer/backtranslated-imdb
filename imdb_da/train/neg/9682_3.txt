To overcome his wife, an old man does what anyone in his position would of course do (at least in a Peter Greenaway movie): he and his son populate their home with eight and a half (you don't have bones) women and start a sexual odyssey. This is a Greenaway movie that is full of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and the son share a bed that sleeps naked. Gross. Besides, who will see an old guy full frontal? For those who are not in the gay-erotic scene, one of the women may like to make it ugly with horses. There is no story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
