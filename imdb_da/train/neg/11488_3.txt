It is hard to imagine that anyone could find this card their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts, but I know that humor is very subjective. I've seen all their sound shorts (by far the best of their IMO stuff) and I found this one of their weaker efforts. This year, this was made (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and a function. They were extremely popular, and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of keeping them constantly. In addition, this was a time for experimentation for the authors and Stan. I would say this was an experiment that didn't really work. As someone else said, it doesn't play their strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. The best part of this for me is the largely impromptu sequence with Stan as Agnes girl and the great Thelma Todd talking about "girl" stuff. <br /> If you really want to see the boys on their most creative and fun check out Blotto or Brats from the same year. They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for exhibiting some less than a pair of shorts. They made something like 108 movies completely. Very few (except for those made on FOX) were direct errors, but there are some. County Hospital, Me And My Pal, The Live Ghost, Fixer Uppers are going to think of as essentially weak. But other than them, I find something wonderful in almost all their shorts. Totally record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed all of their other shorts, check it all out, but I'd be willing to bet this was less than memorable to Stan and Babe.
