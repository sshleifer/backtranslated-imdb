Originally sent as an ABC movie of the week. This involves two young innocent female college students who are the railroad into a prison camp in a small southern town. They are not allowed to make phone calls and nobody knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, stroke, humiliation and degradation, leading to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV release was (for its time) gloomy. No nudity and beatings were pretty tame, but the overall sense of blurring bore one down. The non-classified version is even worse - there is ample nudity, the violence is extreme and in a particularly obnoxious order we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard "uses" her. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with exploitation film, but one just goes over the edge. You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy getting these poor women tortured and degraded - all this is pushed into your face that you should enjoy it. The unnecessarily scary end doesn't help. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because the play is good - but it makes the movie harder to see. A sick, sleazy movie. Not recommended.
