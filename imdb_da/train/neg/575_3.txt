This movie is not very good. It's boring and not much blood for a horror movie. The reason is just in spite of not much event. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters, as it shows that she has lighting as reflexes. But when she has one of them blocked, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to the cable. FINAL VALUE: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie. You are a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
