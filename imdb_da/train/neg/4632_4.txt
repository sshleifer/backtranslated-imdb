Maria Bello does not seem to like what people think of her choice in film roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in. Perhaps she needs these movies, to get out of sugar-coated (aka "Hollywood") those she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3). <Br /> <br /> Although I do not think that achieving what it is supposed to do (I do not want to spoil it), Maria Bello is as big as in her other independent / small films she is in. her performance raises this movie. This combined with the weird topic made it almost for me. But in the end (and although I try to overlook some errors, such as poor pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long
