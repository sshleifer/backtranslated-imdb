I often comment on the utmost dirth of really scary movies on the market, and unfortunately, White Noise only served to reduce my belief that the film industry is still capable of such action. I was surprised to find myself growing more fatigue when the plot was on and my statically induced headache increased. I found white noise to be confusing beyond our best efforts to suspend disbelief. Even after witnessing the miserable trial maintained by Michael Keaton, I was completely unaffected by his death. Until the credits I waited diligently for something - something - to connect with the characters' history, but such relief never came. Of course, there were occasional cardiac arrest moments, but only because loud noises tend to make it the throbbing seer. <br /> <br /> While the play was paralyzed, Michael Keaton may have played his most responsive role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the amazing architecture of both Keaton's residences. Overall, White Noise leaves one with the morbid depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows, trying to trick living into following the dead into their own graves.
