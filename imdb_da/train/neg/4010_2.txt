When I first looked at the show, the first episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire, and Sookie introduced himself as an independent woman. But the show went downhill from here, and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the protagonists lose their original personalities with their plays. At episode 5, Bill's embroidery eyebrows are so low that his face only consists of a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than his vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her, and she only reacts to how comfortable it was to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the protagonists sleep with each other too early in the show. The way they tormented each other was something that had me connected and easily rented with a little more. As soon as Sookie loses it, she sticks around like a total ditz, only thinking of Bill's libido and the size of his follower. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just gets silly. His actions are never really explained unless he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is never immersed in if there is any love. So far, it just seems to be sex that is at the heart of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires usually respond to sex, but come back. Every five seconds I see some kind of humping going on. It was not so much surprising as HBO always tries to pass a soft core porno as a decent TV show. Bill popping out of dirt and just getting it on with Sookie for no reason what's so ever? I laughed so hard that I almost throw myself. <br /> <br /> The reason is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into detail about anything. All the events that happen are usually inexplicable. The only thing that is constant is gender. The only thing I can say I like is the little characters. Tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I continue to see the show is for the development of the smaller characters. <br /> <br /> Smaller sex and protagonists show would be much more worthwhile.
