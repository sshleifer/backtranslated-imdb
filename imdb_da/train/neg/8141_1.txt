Seeing it, living at night, lets you wonder just who in the world green-lighted this crap. A newlywed couple is playing on their honeymoon, being attacked by bats and the man is starting to run around in his pajamas that attack different people. And where are they exactly? They are in the desert, so they are skiing, so they are in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff who likes to see and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy. The ski church is run by a real groov guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic excitement and the end will leave you full of anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this movie. I think you should start somewhere.
