At first look at the plot tagline I figured it could have been a decent movie. Could I ever have been more wrong? At the start of the film, it looks like a bunch of freaks came together and decided to make a low budget film. In the first 10 minutes you will not notice the cheesy play, horrible sound and godly special effects, but then it gets worse. About 20 minutes in that I asked myself, "What was the plot again?" I could only ask that question since I was not busted out laughing at the glorious lameness of this movie. The main actor has an attitude to emotion, and he sticks to it throughout the film, even though he should undergo love and hate and everything. The feedback scene almost made me vomit, because it made me live an extra minute of recordings from earlier in the movie. Now we hit the middle of the movie, where of course they try to tear Morpheus from "The Matrix", even though he is just doing a terrible job. The actor talks about "Star Wars" and fortune cookie phrases are almost unbearable. Now at the end of the movie, you don't realize it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is developing. The "Morpheus" character dies, the only good thing about the movie. He speaks a few words and the credits roll. What is this? No plot, bad acting, cheesy everything, it couldn't get worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
