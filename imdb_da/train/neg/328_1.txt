I am a huge Adam Sandler fan and one day I saw the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and then 'Going Overboard' and decided to go and rent it. So I went out with a couple of my friends and rented it. We put it on, and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who didn't hit puberty yet, he looks like he was 12 when this movie came out. I couldn't even see 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle or even smirk on this movie, actually the only time I grinned when I saw how horrible this movie was. I couldn't believe how hard he was trying to make viewers laugh in this movie ... and it didn't work once. Although I could not hear from this movie, but because I had heard the horrible camera angles and heard the disgusting script, I understood that it is more than anything that has ever sucked before. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie ever made, .... EVER!
