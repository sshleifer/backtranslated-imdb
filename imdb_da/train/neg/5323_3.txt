I can't believe that in the 34 previous comments, no one mentioned that this movie is a blatantly rip-off of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring an apparently silly blonde to the demands of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever. Gangster is left in the lurch. But Yesterday's birth was an intelligent treatment, while only so much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is regrettable. Natalie Kalmus rolls over in her grave. Check out the paper girl. Declare him? But it is historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is Ewell's introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at that time.
