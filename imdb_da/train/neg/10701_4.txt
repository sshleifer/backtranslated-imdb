Merry Madcaps in London is a treasure hunt in which a young woman unintentionally sets her married politician father with a strong, independent lady-flier who has never been in love. Exciting early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn who plays an Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix who has been for the self-indulgence to pass on to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view, but why were all the old clich√©s kept intact as frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the kind of simmering, scary wife who goes to her bed when things go wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another bummer. A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate watchers. ** from ****
