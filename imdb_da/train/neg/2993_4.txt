I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a good scary movie. When a terrorist's body infected with a stolen chemical is restored by the US military, the body is then cremated and releases the virus into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon they will be infected locals to meat-hung zombies, and a group of holiday soldiers will stop with a group of tourists and endeavor in an abandoned hotel as they try to fight for the aggressive living dead. I didn't find this movie as good as the original movie, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror movie with some good actions. I didn't think it was one of the best in the series. 4.10
