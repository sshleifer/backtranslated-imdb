I happen to be the director's nephew. It has taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this movie, and I can confirm that it really is one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle didn't even have a copy of it anymore (I asked). I look forward to bringing him a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently, the movie's average rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, it should put it somewhere in the mid 30s of the IMDb "bottom 100", but with only 206 votes , it is not yet laid. It's boring that movies don't even respect a bottom 100 title. <br /> <br /> In any case, I give copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best / worst gift ever?
