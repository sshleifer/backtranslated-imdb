I saw the omen when I was 11 on television. I enjoyed the Trilogy. So when the chance to finally see one in the cinema came around, I didn't get it up. I went into the cinema and knew that what I was watching was not a cinema release, but one made for television movies. But being a fan I couldn't resist. But this Omen movie, which I saw at midnight, does not bring chills, it caused laughter. Risible Dialogue as "it is written that if a baby cries during baptism, they reject that god". What nonsense. Not decent put pieces. Faye Grant so good in V is wasted with this script from hell. No surprises and no fun. But I laugh out loud several times on our bad it was. Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
