Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) Head of BBC3 must make programs aimed at various audiences for BBC1 and BBC2 to retain license and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his unfunny friends up. <br /> <br /> 3) Head of BBC3 snaps them up, completely ignoring the fact that they are not fun. Worst of all, it's probably a racist, which all characters play up to bad stereotypes. If a white person did this kind of thing, there would be rebellion! <br /> <br /> Trash.
