Many royal fans hate this because it went from the book, but movies are another medium, and books should be changed when they make the jump. In spite of that, the film doesn't fail completely, but it fails entirely on movie terms. I'd like to sneak the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I've asked, silent. Occasionally someone, with the loss of a decent scare (there is no ...), names "grape juice-shoot-out elevators" shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe you're slightly scared. I have just rolled my eyes and see these z-grade horror ideas play out in this obscure, incoherent movie. One place it derives from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to Overlook to kill him only; with the stupid member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor, that it takes Halloran FOREVER to go down. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and good choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more "off" draft in any movie ever made? <br /> <br /> I consider it a miracle that I could eventually bypass this turd and agree that Kubrick's 2001 is a truly important movie considering the enormous 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie and the cult of fawning, but naughty Kubrick fan-boys who could not describe an idea at work with each movie resource in the congress library in front of them. <br /> <br /> Fight in the grotesque overactive of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of stupid lines in tense moments, and the nominal Razzie performance of Shelly Duvall, and you have a very crappy movie.
