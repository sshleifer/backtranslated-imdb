This movie is AWFUL. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie that was inadvertently fun for a long time. Leno should have stood up to get up and late night television. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie itself was the stupid movie I've ever seen. it is pathetic, the play is terrible and the plot could have been written by a 4 year old. don't understand me, jay leno is fun but not in this movie!
