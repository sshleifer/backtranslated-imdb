I already know that critics and some audiences say it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, the names refer to some other names, etc. It may be. I can't realize such things (I won't do it anyway) because I'm not interested in I'm interested in 'cinema'. Regarding the film itself, it is said that the film is smart and dramatically strong. I couldn't see anything we didn't see in monster movies except the scene that takes place in an office in the second half. Yes, that scene says something about humanity, but it doesn't make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mild) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. With regard to the film's biggest mistake, it is visual effects. It was just shocking, I couldn't pull myself together for a while because I was expecting a realistic monster because it's not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it wasn't. It's like you don't think there's a monster, you can't care about it. If you agree with me, I highly recommend Cloverfield, who is extremely realistic. The monster's design is not interesting, but at least planned there is an effort. Dramatically strong criticism. Some critics talk about it as being a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically strong. I don't want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I'm trying to mean that the host doesn't do anything that other monster movies don't. That way, some people can call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's it.
