I wanted to vote zero or lower. I loved the comment. It's the worst movie ever made, and 'indelible' is the perfect word for it unless there's anything worse that Roget never believed in. I am also unable to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best thing about her is that she is consistent.
