This movie tried to be too many things at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values ​​promo ... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably for all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off at the end. Although I appreciate the spirit of WAR, INC., It pushes me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken off its goal to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than just the bad writing, direction and production of this film. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism about the corporatisation of war. But poking fun in this way reduces the true cruelty of what happens. Reminds me a little about three kings who also trivialize a real cause for concern.
