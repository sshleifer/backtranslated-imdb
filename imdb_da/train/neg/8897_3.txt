I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, I had listened to the original Broadway recording of it, and I really loved it! But when I saw this, I was just like what? This movie lacks many songs from the musical to cry aloud! Who decided to do all that ?! I'm really a very big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he has ever done! The movie looked more like a Hollywood set than Scotland's beautiful Scottish Highlands. And who the hell decided to cut all My songs out of the movie? <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they watched this movie, Lerner and Lowe probably wondered, "Who in the world decided to make this our masterpiece?" Now they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry that Hollywood turned their big musical into this rather shiny movie. <br /> <br /> Singing and Acting Mr. Kelly, you passed audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that lacks much of the text. <br /> In short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
