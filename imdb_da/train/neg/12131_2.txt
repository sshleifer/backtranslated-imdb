Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately management is not his forte. I had high expectations for the movie before I rented it and that is why I didn't like it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that is mostly in a small setting, but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the movie boring, boring and stretched out. The action was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious of most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but it was one of his first films (I got a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered, and the camera moved along the line and past the wreck. But that shot was very "unusual Suspects" ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from the previous movie of his (which is very good mind you). To watch a fabulous movie taking place in a small setting, watch Hitchcock's lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have seen it before filming this.
