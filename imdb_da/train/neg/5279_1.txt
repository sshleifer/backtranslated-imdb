My friends can usually put up with many hopeless movies, but it was too poor for us to see it at the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the "hot" girls staring in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was just predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The action was sometimes good ..... but several times bad. The most annoying sign in the whole movie, which you just wanted to die for, should be the protagonist's best friend. The more I saw him, the more I would smash my screen. (You know what fat ugly child I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The reason has been done so many times before I think they should be sued by other film companies. OK, that's a good idea, but that's all this movie had. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can only be seen if you save yourself abuse from your friends. Or if you absolutely have nothing better to do.
