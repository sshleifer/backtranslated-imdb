... but the keyword here is "normal". I have been known to love movies EVERYONE thinks to be stupid. But in the world of B-rated movies, this one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. What I respect for most of my favorite B-rated movies is that they don't take too seriously. The filmmakers in this kind of film treat the film easily, even though it is a heavy subject. However, I get the impression that the producers of this movie took themselves seriously, as if they were composing a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at exciting lines and stupid camera images. In spite of all this, I still gave it 4 out of 10 stars, as I am prejudiced about movies like this. If you are a B-rated fan, however, I would try too hard to find this one.
