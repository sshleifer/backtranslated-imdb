I can't believe I actually sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst action since Killjoy. Here's a brief overview of the plot: The movie starts with Jojo and the other chicken sitting around the beach throws over a shiny blond-haired beach "hunk" that looks like he hasn't been in the gym one day in his life. Somehow everyone knows him, and every chicken in the movie wants him. Oh Oh! Here is the competition! The stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends running a nasty pink car. We soon find out that Jojo's mother got the job of life in Australia, which means Jojo had to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'm going to cry). A big storm comes and fills their swimming pool with unpleasant water. Somehow, without apparent cause, the little chick falls into the pot and comes face to face, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the "story" really goes. Basically, they will make the mermaid fall in love with "hunk". <br /> <br /> This is a preteen flick to work so badly, it makes the 80s look like the top of Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the clich√©s possible ... the best friends, "hunk" who everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitch friends, the scary old man ... you name it, it's in there. I took one to many people by seeing this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice for you. Please do not watch this movie. Don't do it, so I suffered in vain.
