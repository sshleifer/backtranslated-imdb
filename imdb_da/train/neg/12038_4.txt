Do something on the whole in this movie. There are only the bizarre short scenes where I didn't know what the hell was going on, so it doesn't count. This movie is so boring it hurts and it comes from someone who likes it when movies are about making movies. Confused? Yes, I was after seeing this crap. What was Donald Sutherland on because he missed it with this hero. And what about the "pedophile" scene at the start of the movie. Can put someone to sleep! 4.10
