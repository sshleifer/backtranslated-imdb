This was a horrible movie! I gave it 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and another for the beautiful Porsche at the beginning ... Except that the story just sucked and cars that drove through cities were not so new in 1970. Happyend was probably what annoyed me the most , rarely seen anything so constructed!
