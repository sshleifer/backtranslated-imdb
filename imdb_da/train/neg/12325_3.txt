I remember that show. I still remember that kick singing fun song "America's Funniest People." Frankly, it should have been the title of American lame or unfunny or even obnoxious people. Dave couldn't save this show, nor could Bob Saget or AFV's replacement hosts come later. The jackalope segments were fun and yes Dave could make some good voices that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people filed. It also evolved as something of a selection of lame guest stars, including the Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in the lead before they started picking the chilling ugly as mind babies who win. Did I say the videos were disgusting and paralyzed? But the theme song is still rock!
