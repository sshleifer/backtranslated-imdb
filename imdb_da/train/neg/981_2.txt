As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I finally had to see this very boring picture. It's Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the world's most beautiful blonde is red-haired! Poor start The story is a huge drilling that involves a topic that drills myself drill me rigidly: religious guilt. (Who needs it ???) Suffice it to say that all of Dietrich's films (and I have seen most, including "Pittsburgh") are the only things here, even where her performance is hardly worth seeing. Color photography is OK (this is a very early Technicolor release), but without reason. Ridiculous casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (probably said?). All that is not at all interesting is John Carradine's foreign caricature of a performance "The Sand Diviner", which advocates everything that will happen. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever perceived. Yet another example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good movie? - apart from one?) And to a final annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with volume levels apparently randomized. Very unrecommended.
