Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were awful, and sound editing was whacked. Most of the movie that everyone can here is the crappy kicking effects, with muddled talking in the background. I had to turn my volume on full blast for her, what was happening .... and what should I hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can't believe that people actually have anything green for this movie. It makes me think I could take a nap in a box, send it to producers, and then get them to fund a movie for me. <br /> <br /> Dolph, was a regular, Dolph. Nothing else has to be said. The bad guys were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was a stinker. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, managing, or editing a movie, watch this!
