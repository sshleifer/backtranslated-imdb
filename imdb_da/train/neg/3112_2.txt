Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too many spoils into this. Usually I enjoy Robin Williams movies, but this gem was not one of them. It was billed as an exciting thriller. The night listener was anything but. To be dumb there were 6 people in the opening day of the theater, 2 went out for good reason. The film was, in my opinion, poorly written and directed. The action was okay, but again there was nothing to work with. The film is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying child. But * spooky insert here * no one can verify kids existence. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, but all he gets is headache and excuses from the boy's caretaker. There it is, that's all. You wait about an hour and a half, and the movie ends. It had as many tensions and chills as a dental office visit. The gay undertones or overtones really had nothing to do with history, and the movie had a slight shadow, but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and had little meaning. In conclusion, I really can't write a decent review on this movie because nothing was so captivating to see paint dry. I gave it a 2 because the action for what it was worth was okay and it was not directed by Uwe Boll.
