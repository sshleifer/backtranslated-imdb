it's incredible! Fidani (as he was also a spiritualist) was one of the cheapest instructors in the world. This movie stole the original title of Leone's "Duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (the unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). Everything is bad and crazy in this pelicula filmed into the dear landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not able and ingenuous at the same time. In the story, there was a kind of crazy illogical thing (like the discussion in the sheriff's house and Butch Cassidy's demented look!?!?!?!?!? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd portraits, illogical plot, bad acting and a bird's appearance of one of the most rewarded anchorman in the history of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Oh, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes it is big and awful, but I'm sure he was in it just for money one to play with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DO NOT MISS !!!!!
