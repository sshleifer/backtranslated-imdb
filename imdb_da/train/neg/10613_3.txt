The dance was probably the only attentive thing about this movie - and even that was disappointing compared to some other movies. Min gawd! For me, it's the worst kind of movie - one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the film-as-art prisoners. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and excitement of the dance that the film apparently surrounds. Tango is a tease, it's hot, it has drama, it's obedient - just what this movie is not.
