From the horrible death scenes to weapons that burn without making sounds to a character called Fiend. It's all tiring, slow moving, imaginative drive. It was ok to see the guy with the jacket and the hunchback lurking around. Visually, it was scary and probably recorded the movie, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a movie like this. I was just waiting for something to happen, when people were standing and talking and acting like they were in an office picnic. And then there are the bullets as previously mentioned commentator. Perhaps the best thing would have been to look for a water plate on a person's trouser pocket.
