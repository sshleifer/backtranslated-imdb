Unfortunately, more downs end ups. The reason was pretty decent. I mean nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. The other good thing was thrown. I'm not saying the play was good because it wasn't, but every actor / actress was warm and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the downsides is that the movie only gets exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another down (or you might consider it one up if you want) is the exaggerated nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their push for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but it was a horror movie, not "The Dreamers". Unless you're very desperate to see some guy take out his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a drowsy fan of Debbie Rochon than this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
