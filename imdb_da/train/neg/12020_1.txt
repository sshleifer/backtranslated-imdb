This was such a waste of time. Danger: If you see it, you'll be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and raise it through the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur production: horrible, repetitive, vacuumy dialogue; paper-thin plot line; wood performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetic hackneyed. <br /> <br /> Seriously flawless story, absolutely incredible characters. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The reason "twist"? Outrageously simplified and obvious - like seeing a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies. It doesn't even solve correctly. The evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please kindly - do not look at this even if it is free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue.
