** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs Keaton, probably with your Annie Hall philosophy and hats. <br /> <br /> This flick is just too much like Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who could not be reached on the phone at the start when she was in the bag with her companion and had pulled out telephone jacks, grieves in a new way for grievers. <br /> <br /> She retires to summer lands where all Sara's friends are staying. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to reveal things that were better not to be revealed. It seems that sweet Sara slept with her boyfriend and the guy who eventually married the latter. Besides, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now put on this blame. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find the unpleasant diary Sara held. She also hopes that girlfriend Adam, who is a playwright, will not include all this in another game. <br /> <br /> Once the diary is found, it has been written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D in this language. It's not so great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a Japanese chef into a Japanese restaurant. All in all, everything seems to end fine. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time Mother and Sara wanted to talk, they would both pronounce Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that is not enough, during this bizarre extravaganza of grief, Keaton says Adam is not another Woody Allen in his movie, Interiors, where he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Mrs. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, people, can we realistically believe that someone in his right mind could mourn like this? <br /> <br /> Fair to mediocre best summarizes this movie.
