After purchasing the DVD in a commercial box because of the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I put it in the DVD player and everything looked great. Nice animated menus and a lot of extra features ... but when I played the movie myself, what a disappointment. It's the worst I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the movie here at IMDB is actually from the people who made the movie. So don't believe it unless you like to waste your money!
