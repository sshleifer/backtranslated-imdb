Pathetic. This is what happens when the instructor comes to work just because someone is paying him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great places and settings for a movie of epic proportions. But the show, fucking! I swear, in some shots, you can see extras on the background staring in the camera or watching the actors because no one told them what to do when they hear "Action!" The battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people real? They could have done more harm just by hugging each other. In slow-mo scenes you can see people on the battlefield walking around or just standing and waving in their hands. <br /> <br /> Only foreground action is somehow highlighted. But what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems to random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even that. The dialogues are stupid, the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong's action film. <br /> <br /> With a budget of $ 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the ultimate result of all this huge effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin deck located on shelf in video store.
