I rarely write these comments, but I felt compelled to save others the pain I continued to see this movie. It's so stupid and incredible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government scientist turning around in a new Porsche and serving with his team in a restaraunt similar to a castle overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. That kind of life on a state wage? Hah! It only gets worse. Towards the end, when the bad guy starts killing the good guys, the latter group seems so stupid that they want them to die to clean the gene pool. Special effects are pretty good - every producer's money can buy it - and leading players have been good at other films, but the manuscript and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered if there was any intentional intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's former facial stupid movie (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie was supposed to stop the wonder. He is simply poor.
