<br /> <br /> This movie sucks. Ridiculous "school" atmosphere, incredible students who are very poor and behave like criminals, but later after the good teacher, Nick Nolte taught them that they were as good and as quiet as kittens. <br /> <br /> If this works for you, don't do it for me. 0 out of 10
