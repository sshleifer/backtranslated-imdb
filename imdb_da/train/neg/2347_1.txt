Let me first say that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; therefore I was curious to check out here, her debut role. No argument that her talent is clear and her performance outstanding. I also think I can see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I think movies are meant to entertain us, and this is where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> At halfway, I thought to myself: "How much longer will we be bored with the shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the goods? It seemed to continue forever! <br /> < So, maybe I thought it might be one of those films where the instructor is trying to put the audience in a relaxed state before hitting them with a dynamic event, no such luck. The movie continues it's boring, boring, inevitable story to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm an action junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br/> < br /> Add the fact that movies and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home videos. Depression! <br /> <br /> I just don't understand how anyone liked this movie. Zero entertainment value. life. <br /> <br />
