This movie is remarkable for three reasons. First, apparently exploiting the success of the two Superman series, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters that marked the initial appearance of George Reeves and Phyllis Coates as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow land' that allows the 'Mole-Men' to reach the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Other, unlike most fifty-fifty SF invasion films, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in the proclamation and enforcement of tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregation vigilantes. No 'mild mannered reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and confident, takes control of the situation ("I handle this!"), Even assisting in a hospital dress in the removal of a bullet from a mole-man! As Superman, he is milder than Clark against the feudal lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance when he shines against vigilantes as "Nazi storm troops". <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flight of Superman in the two series to "live action" flying in Superman's Adventures was not yet made.
