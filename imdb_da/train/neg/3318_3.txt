How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... too badly she is completely out of the role. I haven't read the book by Jane Austen, but I can't believe it's so superficial, and the characters aren't much more than caricatures. It was not certain that it was easy to reduce during the 2 hour show about 600 pages of the book, but I had expected more than just seeing old furniture and teacups. I was needy every time I saw an actor who didn't exceed the overactive mark (a couple of times).
