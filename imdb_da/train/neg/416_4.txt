(some spoilers) - as if you didn't want to know how it would end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good advertisement, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every prerequisite for a fantastic movie was completed. Unfortunately, these things have no significance at all. The film was very much week without excitement and horribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It's about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the animal test, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. When he is invisible, he completely changes and understands the benefits of not being seen. From this to murder there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. It suffers from the disease that many new films have: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have led the producers to a great tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven destroys everything that only focuses on special effects without confusing the real value of the movie. I have to admit, for example, is great, probably the best I've seen since the Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. In fact, it's the problem with the movies today. Like Verhoeven, most instructors only care about spectacular scenes - and no more. The exceptions are very few, and probably Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines amazing special effects and great plot. <br /> <br /> After the Starship Troopers, Verhoeven is disappointing again. Instead of a big movie, HM cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1. Special effects 2. joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not spoil this moment for you ... ) <br /> Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not tense at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. You know from the start who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only worries about the effects. <br /> <br /> Very many clichés. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the bad guy wakes up a couple of times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- As in any low-quality cloud, the first rule is to let characters separate as much as possible. Each time there is someone alone in the laboratory, perfect victim of Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: Bacon should initially scan your finger to enter the laboratory. After he is invisible, how can he do it? <br /> <br /> --- The end: Terrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly without looking back. Is it normal? Then Bacon rises, attacks them, they "kill" him again. And then Shue screams "I heard an explosion" (happened a few minutes ago) and they suddenly run inside. Didn't she ever hear that explosion? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene where you can watch the microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So it's about Hollow Man. What was to be a good movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Reconciliation: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
