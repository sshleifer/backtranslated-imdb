There may be something poetic about seeing the dentists. A little they do in this boring, really terrible movie, but they also get the audience to suffer from the pain of the non-dental variety. If you ever see a movie full of screaming children, barfing kids, sick children, lots of long, long meaningful looks, a deadpan wife and a worried man: this is for you. Drilling, slowly, it stands out as one of the examples that cries out: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with some really good songs. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
