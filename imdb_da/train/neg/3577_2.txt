This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a well-known Harold Robbins formula: ambitious main characters in decadence while pursuing the way to the top of some randomly selected but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. But even though it's so formal it is completely predictable, this movie also manages to be absolutely incredible. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress must be charitable) never convinces as a writer. One would expect a film about film making to gain some insight into his own industry and creative process. But the manuscript gives her none of the qualities that make writers interesting movie characters: adherence, skill with words, a love relationship with her own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And it's just a taste of the incompetence shown here. The kinematics are so scary that sometimes it is difficult to see what happens. And the scenes never really connect together, so everything looks like a series of random moments on bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
