This movie is probably the worst I have seen. Bad play, bad script, bad everything. Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from about the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more robust in both history and direction, and yet it is Albert Pyun who has also directed these two! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly because of an environmental catastrophe or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood, and there is the story ... The Cyberspace needs to get many people to fulfill that "prophecy" and humans need someone to stop them. A girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creators of cyborgs has been designated by fate to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the director tries some Hong Kong stylish fighting situations with the participants flying high and leaping far. Otherwise, the film fails in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for the sole reason that most people will get a new "worst ever" movie to relate to. And for fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg" as I think it is a very undervalued movie with a quite entertaining factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme then check out "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
