If in the first 10 minutes of this movie you are not aware that the protagonist who writes a life counseling column must have the tables - so narrow and learn some valuable lessons for yourself, then there is probably something wrong with you. The setup is so predictable to destroy the movie, even though the rest of the movie was good (as it is). There is virtually no chemistry between the managers and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not fun. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character would have any interest in him. So in the end, it's all packed so wonderfully, and everyone lives happily ever. Isn't the great America!
