One of the worst romantic comedies (no, worst movie) I've ever seen. Boy (who acts as a phone psychologically!) Must pretend to be homosexual moving into an apartment with his dream woman. Hilarity does not follow. Boredom, light gay bashing and horrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crazy dialogue, you will like this movie. Be smart. Avoid this. If you see it, destroy the copy.
