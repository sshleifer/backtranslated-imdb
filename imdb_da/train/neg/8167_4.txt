The forest is not only your daily standard slasher / backwoods cannibal fare, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural items too. The story is about two couples who walk into the forest on a camping trip. A hollow dwelling, cannibalistic forest people and his dead wife and two children ghosts soon terrorize them. There's something you can't see all of them slasher. Director Don Jones gets an "A" for action, even though the movie itself is flattened at almost every level, the play is simply average, except for Jeanette Kelly, who plays the actor's dead wife (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful shots of a few walks through a valley and into a forest. They realize too late that a person stalks them. They are both sent in typical slasher fare. Our killer uses a trustworthy hunting knife throughout the film, except during a feedback when he implements a hand saw, planer-cooled, and rusted saw blade to send his cheating lover. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story line, but the movie just doesn't work with it, I found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting. 4.10
