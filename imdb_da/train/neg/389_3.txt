I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore were pre-negotiating in advance how many episodes they would be willing to show up in. Is it not just designed for Gene to switch to the ladies' team and then throw it on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was it to "look at me, I'm rat!" double episode crap? All that clich√© mafia treasure - come on! The big names voted from having already received money for their charity and got a tailor-made tailor-made exit. Hmm ... This is not reality, but staged drama! Mark Burnett's second show, "Survivor" has also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay's departure, as he clearly had a short time before his child was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
