This one is a little better than the first one. It still relies on a lot of humor that almost says the old Bond movies were not realistic. It carries thinly for so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this. <br /> <br /> There is a huge amount of total gross humor. Hopefully one day real comedy will come back.
