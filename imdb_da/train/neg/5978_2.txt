This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and for repeatedly entertaining older children. The film's message - about dealing with losses - is undermined by the young girl's father back in the film's credits. Team Rocket gives some pleasure, but they are not really part of the little plot, so they do not appear very often.
