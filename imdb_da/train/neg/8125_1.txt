"Bat People" is a really bad movie that deserved the MST3K treatment as well as the other movie "The Creeping Terror." In this we are in a kind of mountainous terrain filled with bats. We see many things happen, like bats flying out and attacking and things, driver hunting, accidents in the emergency room and much more! All this plus the cheese mediocrity in the 1970s (hello, think "Mitchell" here!), Which makes "The Bat People" one of the very best of the last "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes in the series! Moviewise, it's terrible. It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow look with you. "Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
