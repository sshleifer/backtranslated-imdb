... not to stay in Montana and especially not to stay there in the late 1800s. <br /> <br /> "A river runs through it" is certainly a well-made movie from a cinematic stand. Great landscapes, Redford works well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, history is bad (if there is a story at all). <br /> <br /> I was sorry the narrator / author, who is as daring, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is back to see his brother, who is also in the cage in the urban environment, and loses his life. The author never even comes close to avoiding his brother's motivation, but at least realizes that he lacks the smallest amount of homour / fun. All that is is fly fishing, where he himself follows an old man's father's style. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it can be seen from the beginning. <br /> Absolutely NOT a must-see (3/10) <br /> <br />
