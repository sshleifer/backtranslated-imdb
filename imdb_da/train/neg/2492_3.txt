I think I've seen worse movies so I give this a 3, but it's a fight to remember what they could have been !! Possibly Xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly Creep (just blunt), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man's Under Siege staring an even poor man Jean Claude Van Damme. The only solution was to watch Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this site, he has been stuck in television movie hell .... Casper, be more selective .... thank you! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just turned around and there is a half decent movie on the called criminal law ...... now I'm starting to get really disgusting over the last 1.5 hours !!!
