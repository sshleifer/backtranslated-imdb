I went to see the Omega Code along with a group of other Christians totaling about 15 people. We all expected a good piece of Christian filmmaking. What we got was a terribly painful, pronounced and rather boring attempt at a movie. It has great production values, but also has little play, a weak script with miserable dialogue and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it and some people in our group put this movie as reeking of more cheese than "Anaconda." None of us could believe the movie lasted less than 2 hours. Blinking effects and sharp-looking movies can't save this bad, bad movie. I would give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is only so high because I rented the shameful "movie" Werewolf (1996) the night before I watched this movie.
