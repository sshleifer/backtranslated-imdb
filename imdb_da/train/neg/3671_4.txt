Boring, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated with a chemical substance (Weller) going across the country just to find his former wife and children; in the meantime he kills everyone in his own way only by a single touch of his hands. In his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film has a non-original origin, but even though it could be much better. The final result is just a movie with no excitement or hasty moments. Even the good throw is completely waste. I give this a 4 (four).
