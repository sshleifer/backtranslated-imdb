I watched this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with the great Dr. Uwe Boll present. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply set, very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Ball "so bad, it's actually entertaining" way, but just pretty bad. The reason relates to a man who leads a terrible life (due to a past criminal record, apparently), cannot get a job and with a terrible 900 pound cheating wife. This man turns to his cult leader's uncle in a plan to steal a toy truck containing bird flu. Al-Qaida also has the design to steal the toy, and what follows, lies just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. The action is horrible (apart from Dave Foley who really tries after all), the jokes never rise over kids being shot in the chest in slow motion, and people taking a poo. It must be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think "Airplane!", but done by the creators of South Park and without jokes.
