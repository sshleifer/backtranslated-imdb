Guy Richie's third real film (not counting the God-fearing "Swept Away" is a complex action thriller dealing with games, gangsters and chess. Fans of Richie's past efforts will probably hate Revolver as much as I did with his words. Richie Stalwart Jason Statham plays Jake, a recently released ex-con, to avenge the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha (an excellent OTT Ray Liotta), but is instead anchored with a few other disadvantages, one of which is Other 3000 from rap outfit Outkast. ) who throws him and us the audience, a series of red herring throughout the film, all of which become extremely boring. The highlight of this mess in a movie is the bite in the restaurant, where the dialogue turns down in favor of an excellent shot, slow mo shootout set to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. All in all, Revolver is a flawed job, not quite terrible, but far from Richie's best. It would still be Lock, Stock. If this movie was a school homework task it would be graduated 'must try harder!'
