ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> Image ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> While searching for one ( literally) ghost town in the middle of the sky, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving fleshy zombies known to haunt the area. <br /> <br /> An ABSOLUTELY waste of time, from the beginning of Haggerty's painful amateur-efficient performance in a key role. Even worse are the two stories that make up the bulk of maturity, complete routine, worse of indifferent notions and lack of direction by Brad Sykes, formerly responsible for CAMP BLOODs (1999). This is not a "funny" movie in the sense that Ed Woods' movie is "fun" (at least he believed in what he did and was sincere in his efforts despite the lack of talent); Sykes' homemade films are in fact aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel quite angry and cheated by such imaginative, ill-conceived junk. The 3-D format is completely wasted here.
