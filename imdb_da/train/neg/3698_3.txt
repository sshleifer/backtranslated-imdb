There is no need to clarify what others have written in other reviews - here's the summary: <br /> <br /> * Much of the embedded animation work is actually beautiful - the colors are amazing - would love to have it done in silk as a tie <br /> <br /> * The story and performance are a total snooze - it was quite difficult to stay awake at times <br /> <br /> If you are students of art, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so on - have it. This is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you want an exciting, entertaining MOVIE - look elsewhere - it's a failure as anything but an artistic statement. <br /> <br /> Vikings did not have horns by the way ...
