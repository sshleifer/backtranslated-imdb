Very outdated movie with horrible clich√© ridden and mawkish dialogue and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk constantly monitor. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total drilling, filled with histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is horrible. Camera movements are without imagination, like the building of characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. The actors are constantly smoking and we see beer drink commercials. Very cheap, yes. (an exception: Down Beattie's good and simple way to play the hit man).
