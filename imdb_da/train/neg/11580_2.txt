If you want to see a mystery, don't see this. Although there are elements right out of the Elmore Leonard area, it gets closer to an episode of "Dynasty" as the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - that is, long boring conversations between silly and non-involved characters. Some people can make fascinating films without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in it.
