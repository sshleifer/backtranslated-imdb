This is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. This makes "Requiem for a Dream" a Disney movie. Although technically reasonably well made, trades, movies, music, management etc. Are good. However, the final banner scene is the most horrible and violent thing I have ever seen, and I really wish I hadn't seen it. I'm afraid it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think someone would find the movie extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends became the victim in a very similar way, and I really didn't need an explicit reminder of the horror they experienced. I watched the movie at the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX, and none of the cast or crew was present. I would have liked them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their films, which I felt was excessive, free and unnecessary. An earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they apparently sought, but without rubbing your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence. This movie must have a large WARNING label on it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned.
