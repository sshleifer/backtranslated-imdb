After watching this on the MST3K episode, I wonder how many movies this movie borrows from. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point, I really expect Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes are in the plot. like the fact that although there is no gas enough, there are plenty of it in abandoned gas stations, and the stations are close together to keep an F1 car on the road across the country.
