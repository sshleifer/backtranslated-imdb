They would probably have called this movie The Map, because most of the stupid movie is turned around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring pictures of the card are. The only thing they show more than the card itself is the weak beads that are constantly building on the protagonist's forehead. It was, of course, the way the filmmakers show us how incredibly excited things stand up at the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on now, could they not have shown us just one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about how everyone on the map empties like flies, but we don't see anything. Some how I bury Living Manged to keep my attention, so I was pretty generous with the rating I gave it, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with short or sweat, I recommend hiring a better movie that I spit on your grave or I drink your blood.
