I am a christian. I have always been skeptical of film made by Christians. As a rule, they are "know-nothings" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. But they did a terrible job with it. The act was horrible, and unless one is familiar with the Bible somehow, one could not have understood what the film was trying to get across. Not only was the movie terribly made, but the people who did it themselves had some facts wrong. But in this "criticism" these facts are irrelevant and too deep to dive into. In short, the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I don't recommend it to anyone except comic relief from everyday paints. .
