Where is it written that followers should suck? Scream 2 did not! Others didn't! But it certainly did ... problems are horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could trade in the whole movie), bad to write (you'll never understand what's going on and I've even researched the idea of ​​Nephilim before), and just awful choice for casting. Eric Roberts does the stupid archangel Michael I have ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague unless you're desperate to see Christopher Walken. If so, just go to the parts where he is in the movie and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
