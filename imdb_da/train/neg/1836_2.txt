How can Barry Levinson possibly collect white hot comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black, beautiful Rachel Weisz, old pro Christopher Walken and still deliver such a humorous stink? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends until the latter discovers a spray to make the dog mess away and becomes a conspicuous consumer multi-millionaire. The premises are thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been the stepping stone for some big bitches between the two stars, but all interested overplay each hand every chance they can. <br /> <br /> Silent and Black are simply not fun too far too much, Weisz looks sensational as always, but is criminally underutilized and with the exception of Walken as a splendid barfly calling on character to avenge It turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce.
