Scary .. Yes scary !! Jam pack of nudity (from fat people to skinny people), Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie two years ago - it's safe to say it made one strange subject discussion in school the next day. This movie was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This movie hit its low point with one of the newborn characters staring down between a girl's leg. <br /> <br /> Girl: You're not gonna find God in there! Guy: Nah, but I think I found the sky. <br /> <br /> Cut off from this unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics like farting, adultery and the process of superlguing one's genitals together. AVOID!
