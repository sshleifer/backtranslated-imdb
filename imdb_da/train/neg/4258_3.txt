I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time ... When I saw it for the first time, it was just what you could expect from work not based on the director's artistic abilities but on the idealistic, or I'd rather say idiotic habits in our (Kazakhstan) government ... It's a shame because 'Qazaqfil'm had the shoot film great, as it was not honored by the name Shaken Aimanov, but it actually ran out him. The films like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after Mr Aimanov's death, the production of quality films fell almost dramatically in 10 years, as there were very few produced films. But in the late 1980s, "Assa" was shot, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the great country, a year later Rashid Nugmanov shot another movie with co-staring by the same actor / singer V.Tsoy at that time he was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend. The movie is called 'Igla' (The Needle or something). It was brand new. Someone called the period as a resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately, today we have no quality film, our directors are shooting films on the French and Japanese financial support, and so movies are not public, but for the author's professional critics, some of them take a prize at international author film festivals, but a few of them becomes a commercially active product ... And again back to our 'nomads'. Such films are usually unpopular due to large aspects. The same effects were with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, who were also shot at parities with foreign partners, I think they were French or perhaps British. Nobdy liked it, even in the Russian public it becomes a main theme for comedians and comedy exhibitions as 'KVN'. IMHO
