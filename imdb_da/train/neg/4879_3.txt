Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor? The answer is yes; one that does not generate any interest in the whole picture. The prerequisite is not that bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but it is a pot boiler with a bad manuscript and manuscript and just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which includes several well-known faces from the 30s and 40s, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always reject Richard Cromwell as the weak who got Gary Cooper killed in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer ", so I didn't count on him). <br /> <br /> Can't recommend this and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal.
