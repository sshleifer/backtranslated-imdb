This movie has got very bad press from people who do not understand what it was supposed to be. One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously. It's camp, just like "Army of Darkness." AoD was stupid, but fun and bad in a good way. "The Dead House" fails to be "good bad". <br /> <br /> There are qualities inherent to good campyfilm, the most important of which are credible fantasy. You have to believe in what happens in a movie to see humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without limits, the film becomes absurd. HotD lacks any credibility. <br /> <br /> Even worse, HotD does not bring anything new to the genre and repeats the same plot connections and sign reactions that many horror movies inevitably begin to exhibit. Too often, horror films fall into the trap, where the protagonists find love among gore and destruction. I don't know about you, but when I am being chased by zombies, I want to make a hot chick. Believe it? None? Then you probably won't believe it when the characters begin to suck each other's faces into this movie. In addition to the obvious problems that plague this movie as so many other horror films, Uwe Boll chose to add scenes from video games of zombies being shot at random, when a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already incredible plot. In addition, there are frequent and many examples of bad acting, and apparently no attempt by the director to control the actors' reactions to events ... leaving the film without redeeming qualities. Avoid...
