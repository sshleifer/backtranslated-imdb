Judy Holliday beat gold in 1950 with George Cukor's movie version of "Born Yesterday" and from that time on, her career consisted of trying to find material that was good enough to allow her to beat gold again. <br /> <br /> It never happened. In "It would happen to you" (Certainly not think of a mixer title), Holliday has another variation on the stupid blonde who may not be so stupid, but everything about this movie feels warmed and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I think was his first movie role, can't pick up enough energy to experience this reused comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end almost from the beginning, so most of it is just about waiting for the movie to come in. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're enchanted by Holliday, you'll enjoy it here; otherwise I would not disturb. <br /> <br /> Degree: C
