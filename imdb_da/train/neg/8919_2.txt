I first saw this as it was chosen as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. In addition, I am a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it started with the look of his 30-year-old cartoon. With both of them, I thought it would keep my interest. I was mistaken. Just a few minutes in, and I had the fast-forward button down. I ran through it in 15 minutes and thought it was. Then I read some of the other reviews here and figured that I didn't give it enough of a chance. I recorded it again and saw it through. There are 75 minutes in my life, I'm not coming back. <br /> <br /> I can't believe there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think that is because it is difficult to get to the 10-line description minimum. How many ways are there to say that this is a waste of time? The film comes across as if it was made by a couple of junior high kids ready to surrender the world and think they can with breasts, godliness, and fun jokes. The signs are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is the lame, which mainly cobbling the melody, goes through A - E, and hits the obvious profanity an "F" and has no idea where to go. The trip through the intestines to the expected landing does not work the first time, let alone the following. <br /> <br /> Across the board, the whole movie is what you would expect from anyone trying to "out-South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what's and isn't fun. It can be fun if you are tall. Otherwise it is not.
