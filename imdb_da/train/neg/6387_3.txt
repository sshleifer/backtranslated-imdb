When I first chose this movie, I was fascinated by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and love it when merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this movie was all I enjoyed. Although it has to be said that the performers' performances were excellent. The visual appearance - including the animation - gave a wonderful unpleasant air to it. But this was the quality of discomfort lost among the overblown images, both visual and in the manuscript, that you were almost hammered over. Most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. It seemed that the plot was shaggy at irregular intervals, giving a stuttering effect that massively degraded from the flow of the slice. Voice overs from Felisberto - especially one at the end - felt very much like a desperate attempt to fill the gaps in the plot, which had been ignored for side issues like the whole bog (and even it wasn't properly addressed). I'm afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a "reasonable first try" by a teenager who spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from spicy movie makers at all.
