I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment that says this is Sidney Poitiers best movie. Poitier had just returned from over a decade's break in film-making, and he is clearly creaking here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and they do not include this. 5 of his films are on AFI's list of top 100 inspirational films, again, not with this. Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker out to hunt a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border with Canada. Some of the experiments on comedy in this movie fail clearly, and Berenger and Poitier's binding was cringeworthy and awkward (not helped by a completely gentle script). Kirstie Alley (as the hostage) was underutilized and was almost excluded when she was on the screen. Some attempts at excitement are made, for example, when you are trying to guess which of the 5 men on a fishing trip is the killer (all are type-fed villains). I understand that this is the whole appeal to most fans out there. I guessed who it was and I didn't try really hard. <br /> <br /> If you are a Berenger fan, see Sniper (1993), you will even see Billy Zane strutting his stuff. That is much better. All in all, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring, and it's just too straightforward for me.
