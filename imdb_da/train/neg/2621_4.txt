I wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this. With puppies dangling out of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's scary laughs to name some of the events, there is far too much excitement for a young child. The live action gives a more vicious feeling than the cartoon version, and there are a few unpleasant moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, many tense moments that will worry and maybe scare young children. <br /> <br /> I don't know what Disney people were thinking, but neither the story nor the play was of their usual level. Puppies are cute But this movie is spotty at best.
