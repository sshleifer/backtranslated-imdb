We all know that a movie never completes justice to the book, but it is unusual. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were mainly mushed in the same character, most subplots and the main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance became extremely dimmed, which made her seem like a much lower grade than the one I was told in the book. In the book, we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people, which in turn was a key element of family life. In the film she was no more than a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (the Tercero third is, by the way, the son and thus comes after the Segundo spirit) and its connections to it between Esteban and his grandson from Pancha Garc√≠a (not the son he also recognized) is chopped in half and its meaning dimmed. <br /> <br /> One of the most basic things about the book is that the film is everything but cut off: this is called "the house of the Spirit". Where's the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family must revolve around the "big house on the corner", a line listed so many times in the novel. The house is fundamental to history, but the film unfairly transforms it into a simple background. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book before, I'd never guessed that such a juicy, shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
