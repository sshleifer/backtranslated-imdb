The eight Jean Rollin movies I've seen are also perhaps the strangest; The fascinating plot (as it is) initially seems to be too flimsy to maintain even its trim 84 minutes, but somehow it seems to be immensely muddled as it goes along! A true female vampire (tailored, as promised by the title) is held captive inside a remote castle and appears only to "feast" on the blood of willing victims (who apparently are members of a suicide club) As if unsure of where all this wanted to lead him, has the author-director ultimately the human villain ?? actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father ?? ludicrously revealed as a mutant (?!) from the future! The clever pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultures use hoods and animal masks to hide their properties from the protected girl) is, of course, typical of both the film maker (this coastal setting of {anti} climax) and the "Euro-Cult" style as it is the sharp nubile beauty on the display. Personally, the most entertaining thing about the whole of the visually attractive but intellectually unfortunate affair was to look at the famous character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six latter Luis Bunuel films) who occasionally blows it up!
