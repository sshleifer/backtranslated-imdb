I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. It moved very slowly and was just boring. If it had been on TV, it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer worked on a faulty foundation. If this is solved based on the director's life, why didn't he get anyone to see that the writing itself was "loose". Then he steered it in a snail that might have been the source of a few people nodding during the film. The music stretches, but for another movie, not this .... for soap opera saga possibly. There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I wasn't alone because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. Why can't Hollywood make better movies? This one had nugget a great story but was just badly executed.
