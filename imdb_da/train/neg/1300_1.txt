This movie should never have been made. Honestly, I must admit it before I saw it, I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, although she made a lot of movies in the Netherlands, and the young woman who took the body is a television personality with a constant smile on her face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other part, I recently saw in Bride Flight, and although that movie is better, he didn't convince me. To start with the story I have not read the novel on which it is based, but the script that supports the film is something that might have been done with in mind that children have a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, no one of the same age as the director, who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing was the over-elaborated dialogues, it was most talkative. The greeting goes to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something about it. It's a shame that the movie has been edited miserably, if not, some scenes were probably more credible.
