I just finished watching this movie. It wasn't ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed with it. I'm not really sure why anyone would make a movie like this. It was marginally entertaining, but I feel that the people who did it had many disagreements about what they were doing. Monday, the author was responsible; Tuesday, the director Wednesday the guy who gets the coffee, etc. It almost seems that they really wanted to make a few different movies, but only had time and money to make one. Anyone else commented that the play was really good, but I would have to disagree. So again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face under the film, they might be better actors than I give them credit for. The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery ... something in keeping with historical law and order or national treasure. It starts like that, but then it doesn't get out of nowhere toward a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or ... what was the second show that wasn't so good ... A bad episode of the outer borders. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint about the movie is that it's just like the game. There is the evil guy with nailed white hair. There is love's interest, which, when she first looks, blows the wind actually through her hair. Seriously. When you realize it's a Christian movie, the end is also quite easy to see. <br /> <br /> The camera was poorly executed, especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward. It wasn't terrible for most of the movie, but there were occasionally ridiculously bad shots of an old lady, praying, arms up in a dark room, while lightning strikes are striking - the kind of thing that just makes you a little embarrassed by the movie.
