this movie was a terrible excuse for ... a movie. First of all, the casting could have been better; The Katelyn protagonist looked nothing like her TV mother. <br /> <br /> The plot was also pated. It was extremely cliché and predictable. The finish was very disappointing and cheesy. (But that's all I say about it). <br /> <br /> The nail in the bag, however, was a scene when Katelyn (Jordan Harris) was to cry, but the girl couldn't cry on command! There were no tears flowing down her face, just a few incredible snows. she is not at all a dynamic actress. she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire (sp?). It was when the film went from not so good to just plain. It looked like she was acting. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie was really bad! It was a bit of a mixture of every cliché kid movie from the 1990s that everyone is sick of - only worse! I give it a 'F' because it was just so much fun to sit through (b / t / w, I was a kid's walk when I saw it). <br /> <br /> But you like it if your 9 or under. ;)
