This movie was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances from "the next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the artists themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding but cautious presence, wisdom and humor. The rest is too busy trying to canonize him like St. Leonard or as some old testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or bland under-results. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got a striking distance from Leonard's own versions using a little restraint. Annoyingly small pseudo-avant-garde movements are sprayed throughout the film - which out of focus overlays red bullets over many of the concert and interview pictures, blurred camera work, using digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what to be said) and an eerie, pretentious low drone under many of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?). For the right thing, see the songs from the life of the documentary produced by the BBC in 1988.
