Here is a movie with a good cast and nice looking work, but it just doesn't. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better was his PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes. This movie should be sped-up if anything. This horse's foam looked so terribly fake for me and the obvious tire in the desert tracking moments - just lazy. sloppy work. Too bad. The actors made it ok, but I've certainly seen them all better. However, Ben Johnson is always a joy. I first saw this flick almost 30 years ago; was disappointed and then stayed at second view 30 years later.
