I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that a movie based on the book was going on. But I was seriously disappointed with the movie when I saw it because it didn't catch what I loved about the book - the absolutely ridiculously fun Erica and the interesting way she sees the world. <br /> <br /> From the start of the film I realized that things were weren It is the same as I had imagined in the book. So I just went together for the trip. It wasn't that bad, I think. Miss Belmont was quite different from what I had imagined to be! I didn't think she would be one to smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays her, is fun! <br /> <br /> On my own, I thought about the movie, and it's actors / actresses in it did the good job, but unfortunately, I'm such a fan of the book (one of my favorite books of all time) that I couldn't help but feel disappointed = P
