What a bad excuse for New Zealnd Movie Making. I am ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (August 2006). The casting consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship is in fact one of the island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even the company's logo (a dolphin) still has the whole set, including on the ship's funnel. The ship must be a cruise ship / ferry between the United States and Mexico. It has clear signs of rust and old age everywhere, but must nevertheless be a luxury ship on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow-capped peaks of New Zealand's southern island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, the play is weaker and the new Zealand / American accents just don't work. I expect New Zealand taxpayers to contribute to the production cost of this movie, and it was a waste of money that was better spent on real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with marking on it and they are stuck on a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the signs are over the top of the label - they think they would have noticed it in the props before attaching it. I'd like to move on, but it's just not worth the hassle in any way.
