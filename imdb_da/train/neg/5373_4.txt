This is a classic example of a growing problem with film. Why are background noise and soundtracks dramatically higher than the dialogue? What sense does it make? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do it now. For 2 years I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV, and there it is again. Background noise that could take place a city block behind the actors expands the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting in this movie, because in the English version the woman still mumbles constantly. I hoped Jean Reno would say "Sorry, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth." If you watch it on DVD and you even have high school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 because Reno was so good in Leon. People raved about the landscape, but I saw it on a TV and I lived in the Rockies for a couple of years, so "Enh".
