I've read some of the other comments, and I have to agree with those who didn't get the end. I thought it went pretty well. It kept you running and splitting. I didn't have clue what went on in the last few minutes of the movie except a complete mess. It's as if they ran out of money to come up with a good ending, so they improvised. First, they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear as they had a guy talking about area 51 (which makes you think of aliens) and then went to shed. I thought the actors and actors did fine, just the script went sour. Anyways, if you see this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end.
