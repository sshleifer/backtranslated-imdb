To be honest at the time I first heard about this show, though, it might be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on themselves, but that's the exact opposite. I realized that the show doing so can help people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like this in reality, it doesn't mean it's a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype. By looking at the show, regular people will realize that even though there may be bad Muslims, it does not mean that we are all bad, we just try to live 1 day at a time, as it was difficult for Amair to come on an airplane and how he used words like "blow up" or yaser, we say we will blow away from the competition and people took it in the wrong way. Being a Muslim, I know that things like this usually do not happen, but they do, and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq. These are not real things that are not. People will see how we are being poorly treated by seeing this show and it can make them think about how the action is. I'm glad a show like this got on the air. There are many shows that piotr Muslim people as terrorists, many people find them fun for my opioion, it's okay to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of, who are we to say you can't get the fun of it unfairly, but it is often done and really gives the Muslin people a bad name.
