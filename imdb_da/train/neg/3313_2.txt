How can anyone say this movie is a comedy ?? If I hadn't gone, my finacee would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was as if she had the wrong set. I like most chick flicks, but I hated it. It is the only time I saw so much clevage and was not turned on. These outfits were way exaggerated. No one speaks that way any more, and I don't think they did it then. The dancing part was horrible. My earlier said to me later ... "Didn't you like that? Didn't you think it was sensual?" I said yes only to save her feelings. Now I know why we never got married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
