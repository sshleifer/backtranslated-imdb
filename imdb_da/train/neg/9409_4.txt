I liked this show! I think there was nothing wrong with that! Only the Spidey doesn't stomp anyone, but only for that does the show not suck! Some people just think that this show is bad because of it. The story was amazing and it was fun when other heroes appeared as X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! To bad Sandman never appears, but I like it! Best Spidey show ever !! My favorite sections are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot that was embarrassing to see. And I don't like Morbius and Hydro Man. First of Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I don't like vampires. And it annoys me that he was almost the biggest villain in season 2. Of course I must mention Hydro Man! He was horrible! I see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I don't like Spidey as the Man spider! <br /> <br /> But I suppose anything but this was bad!
