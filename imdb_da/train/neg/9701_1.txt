A really bad sequel. Part 1 had many fun moments - part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and of course made to squeeze money out of the fans. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only slightly entertaining moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who apparently seems to like the other characters. It's quite easy to identify with him ... The screen is sloppy / non-existent. The director should do everyone a favor and finish his job immediately. The action is worse than a 2nd grade school game. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is also horrible, but who can blame the filmmaker / sound that had to work with such an unsigned instructor?
