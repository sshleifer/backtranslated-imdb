Let me start by saying that this does not seem like a movie. It seems that there is only one other TV show on popular girls and boys without any real film language at the top. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told that the simplest way is to never publish link with it. This film leads us to where no movie I've seen before: to a realm where the movie theater becomes a hot medium that gives the public any element of interpretation. Too obvious. The big screen is used only as an enlarged TV, from which we can see all the attributes of these women in a greater way than life. <br /> <br /> It seems that young executives are compromising on the art of making movies for sale. This is very scary. The industry is wasting the art of film. We must educate ourselves and our children about what films and its languages ​​are really about. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate on emotions, passions and even culture. Not as a launch platform for young divas and jocks.
