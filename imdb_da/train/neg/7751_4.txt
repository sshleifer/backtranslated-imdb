First, CGI in this movie was horrible. I saw it during a marathon of bad movies on the sci-fi channel. At the end, when the owner of the park is killed, it is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have seen myself. Although the living dead had better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie had almost no reason. Why were they especially on the island? Well, it wasn't set in the movie. And why should the people get into the cat's area? It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a "B made for TV movie" movie, the play was very good. Parry Shen stood out especially. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.
