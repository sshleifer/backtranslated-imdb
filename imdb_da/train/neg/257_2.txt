I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see. <br /> <br /> I went out of this. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit it may have had something to do with the two medieval white women behind the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie turns on a door! Hi Hi ! "), But ... This was just so incredibly annoying. There couldn't be a persistent camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in your face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point it's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, you showed too many lines, you came to many you have heard before, and too many "hard guys" lines ... and I don't mind that kind of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. In fact, it is virtually all the support support just sucked. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx and I think he is really fun and I thought he was fun in this movie ... but not so much fun for me to endure anything else. <br /> <br /> This movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera pictures, more emotions, more emotion and more Jamie Foxx. I gave it a 2.
