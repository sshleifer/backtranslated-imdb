A film about a bunch of filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new form of surfing in haunted waters. As an absolute fan of movies, including some kind of evil animals or monsters, I thought it could be my kind of movie ... it wasn't !!! This should be a guideline for not doing it! It has a lot of unintentional humor in it, and the evil animal is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the protagonists * rolling *, the feet are obviously waving in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh yourself. If only the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassing silly dialogues and the hilariously silly crocodile, it would at least be an estimate, but it will be worse: I guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak It was so, even though the old idea of ​​"sex seller" ... I totally mean for no reason that one of the greatest actresses shows her breasts to the animal. And somewhere in the beginning there is a kind of meaningless "makeout". This is the last ingredient that makes the movie absolutely garbage for me. It's amazing how people actually spend time producing such nonsense! If you are looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
