It has been said several times - not least of me - to see an Eric Rohmer movie is like watching paint dry; It seems that Monsieur Rohmer rejects this (he does not deny it, but how could he just disturb it) so much that his new movie, which may also be his last, Allah, is set so far back in time that it is like looking dry dry. The wonderful people who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already mentioned it as one of the best movies in 2007, so it should give you an idea. The reality is not high on Rohmer's agenda, so in the 5th century France, at one end we have a castle that would not be out of place in the Loire Valley, while the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut. The story involves nymphs and shepherds, and he has often thrown it with unknown ones who are just passing by, so the overall effect is that the annual class game at a school for Special Needs students was accidentally caught on film. One is almost tempted to say 'Come back Godard, everything is forgiven', but even this incredible production cannot make me utter these words.
