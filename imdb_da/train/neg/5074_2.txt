I watched this movie two weeks ago at the "festival des nouveaux images du Japon" in Paris. Although I did not expect much from it, I must say that I have been disappointed like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to sum up how I felt, I would say that I have compared it to Princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end. Of course it is stupid. But I couldn't help it. The stories are quite different, but the depicted worlds are very similar. And from this point of view, "a palm tree" can certainly not be compared to the Miyazaki masterpiece. Although it is quite good technical, boredom remains ... in the end, the complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to dislike seeing it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a bit hard, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
