I don't think they made this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was okay. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not for a television series that was already a successor to the first movie. This film feels like a soap opera. The script is so bad, it's quite simple. The wit doesn't come over, the play is flat, it's shot like a soap, it lacks any direction. The first movie had a good emotional spine behind it. Each character had a small curved shape. It was very simple then, but somehow it worked and I could see the profit of that movie. But this time there is no coherent history line. The characters are boring stereotypes, and nothing interesting happens. A good thing: The Brazilian boy playing Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well thrown. It was their moment of creative success on this movie. I hear they have already shot another TV series as a successor to 'Team Spirit 2', but please God, don't let them make a third move ...
