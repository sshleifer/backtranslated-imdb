I just want to be vague about my potentially damaging comments. There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it is essentially spoiled. <br /> <br /> This movie draws a few ideas from a Southern classic, At Kill A Mockingbird. I guess maybe TKOM got his ideas from some source .... At least after you have seen this, you will say, "Oh yes it's a ripoff". I think the really entertaining thing about these McMovies is when you have identified a plate element, find out if they want to stick to the original or try to twist it around. Not many twists in this.
