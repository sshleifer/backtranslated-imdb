There are some extremely talented black directors Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and a number of others who bring a well-deserved credit to the film industry. Then there is Wayans Brothers, who at one time (15 years ago) had an extremely fun TV show "In Living Color", which includes: launched his career at Jim Carrey. Now we have stupidity to replace humor and coarse gags (toilet humor) as standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those depicted in 'Little Man', they couldn't be. A baby with a complete set of teeth and a tattoo accepted as only months old? Baby comes with a five-eyed shadow that he shaves off. It is clear that the child has sex with her nursing mother behind her husbands, Darryl, back. Oh, it's just fun. As a master criminal 'Little Man', the stupidest thing on the planet is Earth. He stashes a stolen stone that is just as large in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by morons." Based Without Credit on a Chuck Jones Cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny. This is too stupid to be even extremely fun. A clue as to how bad this movie is, Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the second night before the BAT awards, and he didn't, even mentioning this horrible movie. When Will Hollywood Stop Green Lighting Waste from Wayans Brothers? When they come across their white husband's sake most likely.
