What a disappointment! This started with an exciting mystery and interesting characters. Admittedly, it moved with a snail, but I was still caught and watched. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones was good prospects. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalized with possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then Morrissey's character was turned off and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring and boring. It all turned out to be very small beer, and it was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours in my life for that? My advice: look paint dry instead.
