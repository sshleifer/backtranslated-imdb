I give credit where credit is due and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard drink actress who does what she wants. She is brash, sassy, ​​rough and very sexy; she is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's it. This boring excitement movie is a fragmented mess that immediately tries to be a stalker thriller, a murderer, a story of loyalty and treason and a steaming erotic thriller. The movie, my friends, is not exciting at least. <br /> <br /> For example, who was thinking of casting C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man? He is not ugly, but to cry aloud, it seems that Fiorentino's hard cookie goddess gets it on with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the screen presence to fill in the leading man role. <br /> <br /> The writing is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There are no tensions, as Fiorentino's character becomes scary phone calls, there is no mystery about her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the movie. There is no sense of liberation when Fiorentino gets Wimpy Howell to lose his inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting but poorly finished cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and a really great sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides that, my first impulse would be to put this sad piece of waste and rent something else.
