OK ..... This is the third in the series of carnosaur. Lets star with the dinosaur dolls! At the start of the movie you can't see Dino's cause when the body count starts, you can only see Dino's eye vision, pretty smart to hide the bad dolls! And maybe for 16 minutes ahead of the movie a special force with Scott Valentine who leads Rance goes the team into the warehouse and then they begin to find body parts and dead bodies after the Dino rampage, after a while comes a big box failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream, pretty scary !!! and then a black girl goes out and now there is a blooper! It pops up a raptor hand and slashes her face, but if you pause when the raptor comes, you can see that it's just a guy with a hand puppet! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks, some trucks cause them. It washes some weapons in there. 2. Those where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons of raptor and a huge t-rex in there! How does t-Rex fit in there ??? 3. Rance and some geeks will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a stupid blonde girl has told him to catch one of them alive = (4. Holy Jesuits, the raptors have wheels on their performance!) 5. Dino is now on a boat in the Pacific. 6: Oddly I didn't know that t-Rex had a weird thing on hoarse neck ??? 7. END. The movie is good if you want a good laugh.
