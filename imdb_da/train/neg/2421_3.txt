With this ABC family experiment of hit blocking "cheaper by dozen" comes an unpleasant amount of corny dialogue, superficial plot lines and cheesy comebacks. With about two good actors among many will-be, this film is a big disappointment. It's a Hollywood wannabe dito of an already bad plot. Then, because they needed many actors, it meant that they would probably be easier. So the action was not five-star. The plot moved quite quickly, and the turns were bad and had horrible timing. The cross between the sign and the "end ratio" was also too mushy and clich√©d for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
