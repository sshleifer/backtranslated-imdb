Mediocre and downward degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale lacks only the charm of his ancestors, but lacks any talent whatsoever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his terrible performance, which is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did, but he had to stop acting together. He is so annoying that you will put the blur out of him if you could jump right into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen very bad movies this year, but it not only takes the cake, but it is undoubtedly a worse movie ever made.
