Why take a show that millions of us saw and loved as kids and do a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood doesn't make the money it used to. Because they put out trash and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL boys come out on top. It was not away with the wind, but it was fun. This movie is a bin! Hollywood can't make anything original so they take something that was good and destroys it for some $$$. I just hope this movie makes 10x less than it costs to make. The only thing is to have fun with this crap, they are there to run General Lee. The audience is the victim. <br /> <br /> Can't see it, watch the TV show instead. They still hold 20 years later.
