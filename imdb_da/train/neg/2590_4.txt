American Pie has gone a long way from the first. First, I think the actors have no idea what they are doing and instead it is just a remake of a college party that has gone nuts. History sets out as two freshman college guys (with the young stifler) set dreams to attend college just to experience late night parties, sex and of course liquor. The plot is stupid and comes along the road away from the original pie. In fact, they don't even have an apple pie somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent for free. But remember that it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex movies with absolute nudity and crazy drinking. I am a teenager myself and I think Evan Almighty would have been a better choice instead.
