How can Disney get you? Preppy rich girls work like idiots, buy a lot of things and learn a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to himself? That maybe, while you buy everything, it might still be human? Whatever the psychoanalysis, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they need their wealth to get the dairy factory (yes milk) to hire the workers. They keep it floating until Dad comes home. And the man in the beginning, who seems to be the one who takes the money, is the one. But the end is stupid. Webcam on the Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time ever again. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "D"
