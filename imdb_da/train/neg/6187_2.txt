In short, this was a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terribly clumsy; I could not feel any sense behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too fast and felt quite out of place. They might as well have been quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and looked at an American Rochester strange strange. At least he could have tried to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but it just didn't work. I felt I saw highlights from Jane Eyre, where the most important pieces of history were randomly composed without taking into account the flow of history. The scenery and music were very nice, but I couldn't feel any of the passion and love that had to be between Jane and Rochester, and the movie left me completely untouched. <br /> <br /> To see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest watching the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these are two brilliant adjustments.
