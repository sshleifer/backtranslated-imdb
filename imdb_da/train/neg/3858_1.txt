What a horrible, horrible movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, all "A guy meets an eccentric woman whom he likes, but he is already involved with someone who is not entitled to him ....". I was expecting something predictable, and I didn't mind it. The films are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this! Every joke falls flat and the "romance" makes me throw up. The title character is one of the most "please kill me" characters that I have ever seen on my television, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, more like quirky and annoying. "The other person" is the most sensible, mature person in this movie, but it also happens as annoying. These movies flatten out sucks, there's no way around it, don't waste your time.
