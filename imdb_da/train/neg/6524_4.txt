The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> Like "The Man From Planet X", this is a bizarre science fiction story deleted from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still cursed near the same. Meaning, we have some very ridiculous special effects and violent pseudo-science-masking as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" released in high-quality transmission with a sharp image and a sharp sound - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's certainly all the time our space occupation is on Mars. (What did you think, "Angry Red Planet", referring to Neptune?) Before that, some poor-sized crews aboard a spaceship, within which they smoke and throw around sexist chauvinist teasing toward the "dumb woman" member of the team. It would be somewhat offensive with today's standards, if it wasn't so much fun. But Mars is the right reason we look at this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars screams bloody red. It is filmed in this bizarre red plasticy shine that gives the evil red planet an interesting look of overloaded blush. It really is quite a sight as they (ha ha) aliens viewers are witnessing. The best thing is "Ratbatspidercrab." Do you think it's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It is a giant chimera (little doll) of a thing that combines features of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It borders on all puppies and scares it out of our "heroic crew". There are other odd, and badly imagined, aliens should be seen, but it takes the cake. Eventually, the sexist crew controls their "ship" and returns to the planet from which they came. This is not for everyone. Science Fiction movie buffs & curiosity seekers, and some general movie buffs. Fans of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with this (if they never got it on the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
