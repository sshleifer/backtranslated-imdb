I hated the movie completely. It was so retarded. They need some plays. No, wait, it won't help, because the naked brothers are delaying people. You know why I'm here, even though I'm a Naked Brothers Band hate? To warn people before they see the stupid movie so the NBB doesn't get any money from it so they can't make more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the song texts retarded, they are singing badly. Okay, I'm kind of getting out of the movie here ... yet it was boring and they acted horribly. It was not fun at all, even though they tried really hard to be. I think they deserve some credit for it ... Now the movie is not worth your time. Just look at its assessment. The film (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who even has a half brain. Seriously, if you liked it, watch movies where the actors actually work and don't chatter their lines in a monotone. I'm at the drama club at my school and some people are actually better than the night and Alex guys. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I don't even know why I went through even half that movie. I don't think it deserves to be called a movie ...
