Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (like Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico "Border Cop". He serves as a father figure for the young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero) who wants Mr. Savalas must be the best man at his upcoming wedding. Savalas is tough, but chief Eddie Albert (as commander Moffat) may be harder. Tough is what you need to stop smuggling Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Alliances can be in flux. <br /> <br /> If you find the opportunity to hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" expressing repulsion, you should be free from "The Border". If not, you may not have the stomach for the "realistic" cow slaughter scene. Although it doesn't end up being very worthwhile, De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** Borderen (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
