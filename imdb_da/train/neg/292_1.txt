I saw this by chance showing on the cable I wanted to like it as I thought Sandra was quite funny from what I remembered. The only facial movement I had throughout the film was that the jaw fell stunned over how horrible a movie I was passing through. <br /> <br /> The person who said this is one of the most fun movies from all the time, so pay attention to a line, just a scene, it's even worth a chuckle. <br /> <br /> She's a much better singer than I remember her, but I didn't want to see a lounge act. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie that's hard to suffer because they think they should and don't see it objectively.
