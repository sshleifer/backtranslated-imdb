In spite of lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes, this movie is a task to look at. The Murder mystery plot is only a means to mount musical tracks, but it often causes the matter to staggeringly stop being very involved. Although of course there has been a lot of money spent on them, the numbers are poorly staged and poorly photographed. This is, of course, a pre-code movie because the girls often wear very little clothes and there is even a song that sings praise for marijuana! The performances are all one-note, although it is nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as a police lieutenant, looks like the seventh time in the quest for clues, you might throw in the towel or at least forward to the next. number. Too bad the patrons caught in the cinema on its release though!
