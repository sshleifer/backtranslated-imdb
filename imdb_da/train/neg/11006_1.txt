This movie stars, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly names that scream out "quality". And with such uplifting sketches as "Supermodels that take a dump" (a real one sounds it), a guy who robs a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (with a guy scooping what should be out of a jar), lots of gay jokes, a shit about a giant phallus that is a superhero and forced abortion. The sketches are painfully unfunny (like "Batman and Rhymer"), the play that is not good enough to be considered amateurish, and the movie is raw just to be raw ... and stupid. I really think a group of 8 year olds could have made EASILY a more fun movie with the same budget. This movie apparently resulted in a trial of "Slap Shot" Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I would not know who to mess with this case !!! Apparently, he claimed that Scientologists somehow destroyed his reputation and sank this movie. No matter the movie is off-putting unwanted from start to finish and 99% unfunny (for comparison, Ebola is more fun) ... and that's the best thing I can say about the movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing a diaper and participating in the stupid fake porn movie. It's great that his career could overcome this.
