Do you know when you look at your collection of old video footage and realize that there are some that you have only seen once or twice, and you cannot remember whether they are worth taking the time it takes to see them? Alibi is / was one of those films; I didn't find it long ago and decided that I might as well give it a try. I'm not quite sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the movie is really, really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... yes, you get it. The reason is predictable and is not original in any way. Pacing is bad. The play is bad, but it's not really surprising since the two leads are former soap opera stars ... they are used to persuading. The characters are badly written clichés. The movie even manages to screw up the easiest awful way to impress me (through film): right scenes. Even those do not evoke a single feeling for or against any of the cardboard signs. The movie has no real redeeming properties at all ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clichés that it's ridiculous. And that is the only thing that elevates this to a 1/10 rating: the (nevertheless unintentional) comic relief of the many clichés and stereotypes. I didn't pay much attention to the movie, but almost every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. One final note: I was considering using the line "Tori Spelling can't act" as a line map, but I think everyone knows it so I chose the current one as it is more informative. All in all, a thoroughly bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs if you can sit through it. 3.10
