Was it supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama? This movie begins with a noisy teasing between three women. Lived. It moves into a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Lived. There are a few reasons between them. Lived. But when the plot becomes thicker and eventually turns black, I began to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film. It continues in this vein for a while until it finally tries to return to the original light heart. But now it's too late. It is difficult to see why these women will still talk to each other and the final is not convincing. Really a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make movies. It's hard to see how manufacturers ever convinced this movie would work. And the cashier office turned out to be a real flop because I had never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after the release).
