Foot most, this movie feels like a "made-for-TV" effort. The direction is skin-fisted, the actor (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwhelmed and soapy. Denise Crosby especially delivers her lines as if she is cold to read them from a cue card. Only one thing makes this movie worth watching and it is once Gage comes back from the "seminar". There is something that interferes with seeing a young child murder someone, and this movie can be more than some can handle just for that reason. It is absolutely bone cooling. This movie does just one thing right, but it knocks one thing right out of the park. Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.
