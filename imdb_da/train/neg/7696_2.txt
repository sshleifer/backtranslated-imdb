Yes stupidity! I just finished watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too much unnecessary "addons" to a story, to very stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to achieve comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Shame on destroying one of divine stories from "Arab nights" like this one. Childish, naive (both in a bad way) and with many magical mistakes, I don't think it could hold a child of five for more than ten minutes. Princess is lovely, but should be cumbersome because actress does not know how to play a role. The rest of the throw is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Shame that the "good guy" is not better. Only light in this darkness is of course David Carradine, who unfortunately goes deep below his level with this, but at least keeps his actor / "fighter" skills at the top. I'm still sorry to see him in such a kind, but glad I had something to see in all the charade, thank you David. Only for him I give this 2 stars this fiasco ... I would give more to him but it would increase the end result to the whole movie. The rest is so bad I might want to grade it, but there is no class lover then 1 here and I think it would be too much.
