and forget it. Complete. If you really need to see the Madonna act, hire the "Evidence Body", Willem Defoe is in one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialogue. You won't miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is so terrible it gets entertaining. Why should they slaughter the original movie in this mess, I will never know it; guess they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, is definitely not. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie from 1979, you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually work. 10.1.
