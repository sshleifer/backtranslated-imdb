I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing more than continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to watch this movie because the star Zoe Vibration of the second "Demon's Night"; and i would like to see her play any normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script hardly begins and goes nowhere, as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews on the landscape and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
