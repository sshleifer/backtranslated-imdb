One of the worst movies I've seen sloppy camera work, crappy filter use, movies was grainy, script was terrible, I think came how predictable was the big battle in the end ..... <br /> <br /> some the battle scenes were okay, I guess .... some scenes were so bad, it was comical ... as Sorbo got the horse and riding at the end ... LOL I really mean .. a horse? Oh, can't forget how the bad sneakers roll around in the same vehicle throughout the movie. One would think that after killing key witnesses and federal agents, they would have been tracked down. ETC, ETC really doesn't bother to see it ...
