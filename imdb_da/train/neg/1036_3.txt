Ho-hum. A deadly biological weapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly, his son (Luke Perry) has been working on antedot all the time. Enter the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo, and the cat-and-mouse car and the shot begin. Also in the cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to break through this mess, definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.
