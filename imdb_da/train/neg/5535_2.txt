I think the biggest missing thing may have is to be boring. Poor is actually better than boring. This thing has no breathing. It has the interesting fact to take place in Cambodia. How many American films from the 30s take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict is a little difficult to figure out. Even the troop's movements are a bit confusing. What draws it to a resounding stop is the love story. Why the two guys are so completely transfixed on the dippy blonde, I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his zombies (as they are) and forget about her. The movie just goes together. The perfect microcosm is where one of the basic characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphs (or whatever) explaining how to turn people into zombies are kept. I thought they would never get there. A guy takes two steps. He stops He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad actor and insipid dialogue. Actually, I have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is inadequate. That way, a more appropriate title would be the hypnotized rebellion.
