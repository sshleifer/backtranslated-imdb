Dude, really !!!! Where have you been for the last 20 years, it's shocking in all sorts of ways, horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being a low budget, but it is a laugh. If you want to look at the classics, Tod Browning's freaks, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, The Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener Golem and the Ghost Train passengers, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad plays etc. In all the waist of money and leisure you have seen a lot of movies, as horror is my all time favorite, I am really speechless, have nothing more to say, please do not make an effort to see something so bold, please understand
