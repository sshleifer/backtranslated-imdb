Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I would have a few hours of my life back. I'm honestly suspicious when I see that a movie's director also wrote it. In this case, according to "credits", the same guy was "writter and director" - unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were a few interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminiscent of her early comedy routines that exclaimed Judy-ism), which led me to judge these two stars one by one. These moments, however, were few and far between ... and I could hardly see them because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in their violence. I admit I went back to see that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out when I saw it all. No, though I at least recognized who the characters were, which later turned out to be important. The "spinning camera" technique was overused and essentially meaningless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What?!?" or "for goodness sake, come on with it!" Not recommended.
