What a bad, bad movie! I tried to see without quick forwarding ... It failed. After approx. 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I don't think anyone can get knocked down by being hit with a fluorescent bulb that is much less cleaned by one !! The funny thing is, I saw the "The Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box explicitly says "More blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than the theatrical release!" Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all these claims, I was only wondering how lame "UN-Killer Cut" was ??? If you want to watch a great movie about the world of life and the world of the dead, see some of The Night of the Living Dead Series !!
