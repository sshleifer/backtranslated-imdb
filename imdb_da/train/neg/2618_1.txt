... because it was simply terrible. 101 Dalamater was fun, even though it was formal, but it is no more than puerile drivel. The same plot except with the story carved from it; The world's most intelligent and terribly annoying ara Tim McInnerny proves he can't really do comedy (always remembering Percy in Blackadder, but it was his highest spot - it has all been downhill since then); Direction so poor that if a group of college students had done this, you would throw it in the box and tell them to do it again - right this time. Ieuan Grufford goes back better to Hornblower sharpish, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should go in store for several years. Maybe I could be too hard; after all, I did not manage to sit through the whole movie. It will be 1/10; only because I can't give it 0.
