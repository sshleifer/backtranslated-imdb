I would like to clarify a few things. I'm not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai movies, and I'm very familiar with the art biography; I grow up in the 70s by Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. Art film was then really ART; similar paint. People did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried about other people understanding anything. They were out of commercial values; just see some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian Way Bian Yi Duo Yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It is an opportunistic film aimed at fooling festival judges and critics, playing many things without saying anything. History makes no sense. The lack of water makes the government promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in desperation steals water from the public bathroom toilet. There is also a porn start (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress, he doesn't seem to feel comfortable with. There are some romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The Red ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked about, but I think it's less provocative than you can see in the American Pie or History of Violence. The two main characters never speak. Sometimes a musical number 60 style appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in the sculptor. These video clips are very welcome, because the previous scene, without dialogue or only music that looks at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even several minutes, which in movie times is too much. <br /> <br /> There are also a couple of "difficult to make sex without love", "the selfish mind of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It's obvious this movie's purpose (get rid of it) to trick festival juries and critics. It has a few pseudo-shocking scenes (within the scope of Taiwan censorship) and many subjects are open, but nothing is complete or goes anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks, the movie got a few (disputed) prizes at film festivals and made the movie an undeserved commercial success (I see the movie in France and the theater was packed). <br /> <br /> Please do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a scam to the public. Boogie Nights (which I didn't really like), Intimacy and 9 Songs are far better movies.
