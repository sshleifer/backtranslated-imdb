Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, trying to steal a leaf from a news bench and craving a young young man he meets train station. And he's totally in this obscene movie that's all dressed up (except for crab in at least one scene for many), but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple, but is drawn out for almost two hours before reaching a meaningless conclusion. Verhoeven has a good visual flair, but puts on scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas.
