This movie had so much promise. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, at best, it was ridiculous, painful at worst. The acting styles jumped the gamut from real, really, flat (angels, wife and daughter) to over-animated (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience rather than real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the stage of "bug". It's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out. In defense of that scene, however, it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie. I had read that they spent a lot of money traveling to different overseas places. Too bad they didn't need it. I didn't feel like I was being transported to exotic places. Anyone could insert stock footage of the Colosseum in Rome. But to conclude with a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics shown on decoding computers. That is my opinion (and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor had been much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased, this movie would have been good.
