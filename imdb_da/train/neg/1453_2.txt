I'm not sure it was the language or the poor, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and false. <br /> <br /> Having seen Der Untergang, this is a huge disappointment. There is no connection between different scenes, and the play is so incredibly poor, I couldn't even believe that people could make such a mess on something that had great potential. <br /> <br /> Above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound to it, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me think it was improvised on the spot, characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that might have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
