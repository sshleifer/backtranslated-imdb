This film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin, who will visit a boarding school because of his miserable characters in Math. He did not do the best experiences in life before and had serious self-esteem problems. After a tough start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff. <br /> <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you don't already like this storyline, save time and see something else. If you do, be aware of the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he makes it terribly wrong, and then he goes to self-pity all the time. For me, he wasn't the kind of "charming loser" that you can feel sympathetic to and laugh with. Instead, he and his behavior have really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind that I hardly could see. <br /> <br /> 2) The film almost doesn't try to be realistic and the story seems to be, but from my experience the characters are just not (except for Janosch maybe). And yes, I know this movie is based on an auto biography written by a 17-year-old - but I have some experiences with German schools and German youth myself, I don't believe him. <br /> <br /> Showing the sexual awakening is really an important thing for a movie with this topic. But I doubt that teen boys do an "Ejaculate on the cookie" contest, where everyone has to cook a cookie with their sperm during mass masturbation in the forest, and the loser must eat sperm whitening afterwards. Although it was a little fun for me, it is not fun either, nor does it emphasize the serious attempts of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a signature on Benjamin's family and his father betrays his wife - still I don't know why it's there and where to say it. It just bored me. I personally hated this movie to have the Benjamin character, to be without a message, concept, scheme, whatever, and it fails attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can see that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked "The Other Sister" you will probably also like this one. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys should not write an autobiography, and if they do, it does not seem to be the best idea to make a movie out of it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
