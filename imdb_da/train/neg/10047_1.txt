I have now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at first is completely abandoned when the credits roll. If you look at things that they never really wanted to amuse you ("let's check out the basement!"), Then this is your show. Except it's not entertaining or entertaining - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The extent of the virus has never, ever been shown. I can very much overlook the fact that it only affects men, as the resulting situation is very, very scary. But then things deteriorate when daughter lets OBVIOUS pass father into the home and eventually dies to his hands. The woman flies north and runs into a couple of snow situations. Then some kind of spirit or stranger or something appears and saves her (things that make you go HUH?). Or something. Then she's huddling too hot. The end. <br /> <br /> Awful. These directors send in this tripe.
