Admitting having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough shot for a heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Perhaps it is famous extra something that everyone is talking about and making a star a star. It crosses the barrier. It draws you in an unknown sensual and emotional area. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very much recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has unambiguously redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theater to watch "Troy" If you liked epics in the "Jupiter's Darling" style, enjoy this. But if you don't, go the same, we'll keep Brad Pitt in business.
