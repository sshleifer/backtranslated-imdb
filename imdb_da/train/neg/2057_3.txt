Sorry to go against the flow, but I thought this movie was unrealistic, boring and too long. I was tired of seeing Gena Rowland's hard fight with herself and the crisis she experienced. Perhaps the film has some film value or represented an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment value I would wish I would have skipped it.
