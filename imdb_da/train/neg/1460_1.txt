If another Hitler ever emerges, it will be a great deal thanks to nonsense like this movie that propagates the absurd notion that he was visibly confused lunatic from the start. Far from following such a person and choosing him to the highest office in the country, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would be dead in a ditch, nameless and unknown. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading the accounts of Hitler's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for example - will be hit by the fact that people found him a friendly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a glorious mayor, and the fact that his speeches are overwhelmed and ranting to modern ears ignores the times when they were made, as strutting pomposity was common in political speeches. It was the exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was neither a central plank of the early Nazis - which were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual at present. The film makes it look like Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> To identify the next person who will cause millions of millions of people, you can ignore the fleck-lipped ravens life depicted here. Instead, look for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speech inspires the whole nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama's than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I hoped a lot here and got nothing but caricature. The fools who made this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical answer to 'Reefer Madness'.
