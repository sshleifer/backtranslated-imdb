I've seen this movie recently on DVD and I have to say I wasn't impressed. I know it is taboo to knock independent movies, but one felt a lack of entertainment. The principle was interesting, but the execution was short. I found myself thinking "okay, they just get into what the story is coming soon". Before I knew it, the film was over and the story never took off. I can't say I found it real too. It was pretty bad. Not the Star Wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad anyway. I'm not sure what the running time was, I assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the movie was finished, I felt as though I deserved some kind of recognition for the willpower I exercised in not stopping the movie and going away halfway through. <br /> <br /> Again, I was thoroughly unimpressed and eventually bored out of my wits. I am not one of those guys who require quick actions and explosions in a movie, so don't join me as this is a reason not to like it.
