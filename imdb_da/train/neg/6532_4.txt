The movie begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost, but just drifted into space near out the planet. When retrieved, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a recall of the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a large number of very stupid bug-eyed monsters. Strangely, while the sets were pretty good, monsters were among the silliest I've seen on movies. Plus, in an odd attempt at realism, production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation has only made the movie look pretty cheap since they were on the surface of Mars, and the intensity of redness almost made my eyes soft - it was so bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film had a somewhat interesting plot and a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre it is worth seeing. For others, you can just find it all pretty silly - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> With today's standards, this is not a particularly good sci-fi movie compared to the films made at that time, it stacks well. <br /> <br /> PS - Pay attention to Dr. Tremayne when you watch the movie. He looks like Dr. Questing the picture of "Jonny Quest" comic book! Plus, he sounds and works a lot like him too.
