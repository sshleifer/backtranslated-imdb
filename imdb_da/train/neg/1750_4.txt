Priyadarshans HERA PHERI was a nice situational comedy This film actually lacks a story, but it is quite fun, but illogical. <br /> <br /> In fact, they're not a real story, but somehow it manages a good flow, but it's not good <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 fun scenes like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for a lunch and another when Paresh enters. <br /> <br /> The first half becomes boring slowly, but the other half is more fun, even if they are not script. The forests are fun, although you wonder how they never hear every person's voices from inside the rooms? <br /> <br /> Climax confusion is treated as a stage game, but it is quite fun But the movie suddenly ends <br /> <br /> The direction is okay The music is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar excels in his part, which has now become his second skin, but it is his movie completely and he overshadows everyone else <br /> <br /> John stumbles everywhere and fails in comedy Paresh Rawal is fun Rajpal is okay The girls are e high at times and awkward for Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu seen now) are good in parts but screaming too often Manoj Joshi is okay
