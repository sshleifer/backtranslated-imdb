Unless the title should be a kind of spoiler for the wife's transformation (the enemies! Destroy it for us). In any case, if this movie was not Made-For-TV, it should have been, it's so remarkably low-budget, signed, underacted and hit every 70's clich√© except the disco. No one is sympathetic, and you can careless what happens to anyone in this. Prominent are forgotten except for the bad, bad performances.
