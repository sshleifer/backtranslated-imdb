The action is bad ham, ALL jokes are superficial and the target group is clearly very young children, provided they have below average IQs. I realize that it was meant for children, but it is also Malcom in the middle, but they still throw in adult humor and situations. What should we expect from a show led by Bob Saget, the only comedian who is less fun than a ball hitting a man's groin, which is probably why he stopped hosting America's Funniest Home Videos. Parents, don't let your kids see this show unless you want to save money in college. Expose your children to stupidity and they will grow up dumber.
