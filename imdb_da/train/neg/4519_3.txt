Three Stooges - Garden Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature length movie to star Stooges and it's pretty bad. It makes the three tribes around the world in one day (from 1963) resemble a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooges are caretakers at a rocket site. They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus. They meet some things there, including a talking unicorn, they call "Uni", which they bring back to Earth with them. "Uni" speaks like an average comfortable person - "Oh, hi. How are you? Lovely planet here. Hope you like it." Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes just go over and over again. <br /> <br /> Stooges comes back from space and the movie is over as far as history goes, but none told that film makers for the image continue for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens. a brave little song about their journey Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another author mentioned the fine musical score. two classic tunes - I take ROMANCE, and it goes again in song, both played at the party, and * it * really is the highlight of the picture - music from old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The tall sexy blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> Awful - a brand new VHS video from 99 Cents Only Store.
