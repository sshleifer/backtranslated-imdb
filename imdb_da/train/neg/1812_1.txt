Go straight away and rent this movie. It will be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and covered with dust. No one has touched it this year. It can even be a $ .50 special! It's worth ten bucks, I swear! Buy it! There are not many films than can be compared to this - the celluloid version of the goo that forms the bottom of a trash can after a few years. Yes, I gave it a '1', but it really deserves much lower. 1-10 scales were not designed with things like this in mind.
