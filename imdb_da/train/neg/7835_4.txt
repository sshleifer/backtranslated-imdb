Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I am starving for some good television, and I welcome TNT to give these "opportunities". But unfortunately I am in the minority I guess when it comes to cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as the king's writing, the irony is that it simply does not translate well to the screen, large or small. With few exceptions (very few), the King's experience cannot be recorded with the same effect that the stories have when they are read. Many people would disagree with this, but I am sure they will admit in their hearts that the best filmed King story is just a pale memory of the one they read. The reason is simple. The average King story takes place in the minds of the characters in history. He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their feelings, and their sometimes broken or unreal views. In short, King takes the reader places where you can't put a Panavision camera. As the audience sees the filmed king, we are left with less than half the information that the reader has access to. It is not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a sign of a royal story they are reading while being limited to small feyeurism of the same character when filmed. As long as King writes, Hollywood will try to shoot everything that comes out of his word processor, regardless of whether they should. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but pulling the unpleasant Stephen King adaptation that works does require an incredible amount of talent and care. The task is akin to transforming lead into gold, or some banal Zen championships. Oh yes, better luck next time.
