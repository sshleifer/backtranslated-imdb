I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each of them further and further from the books. This is the worst yet. My problem is that it doesn't follow the book, it's titled in any way! The directors and the producers should have named it something other than "The Abiding Joy of Love." The only thing about this movie that looks like the book at a distance is the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Children's names / age / sex are wrong. The whole story is not where in the book. I find it a big misconception for Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, it may be. It's clean. Don't look at it if you hope for a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie of this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I would wish Michael Landon, Jr. and others would stay closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and if followed closely, they would make great movies!
