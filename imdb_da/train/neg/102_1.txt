My boyfriend once brings around Zombie Chronicles for us to see as a joke. Little did we realize the joket was on her to pay Â£ 1 for it. As I watched this movie, I began to come up with things I'd rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These included: <br /> <br /> 1) Drink Bleach 2) Rubbing Sand in My Eyes 3) Write a Letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American Civil War 5) Tax Returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was kick a door down (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a movie had so many mistakes in it. My boyfriend left it here, so now I live with shame to own this piece of shit. News right in: Owen Wilson saw this movie and tried to kill himself. Facts. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE
