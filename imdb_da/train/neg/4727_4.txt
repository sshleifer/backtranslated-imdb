This movie is really something of a curate egg, good in parts. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main error with it is the inability to draw in the viewer's interest in the characters and plot. I got through it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the band's dynamics, but if I had to evaluate it purely because of its merit as a movie, I would have to give that thumb down with a few reservations: Jason Behr is good at John Livien's part and quite convincing as a rock singer; The story of his childhood trait is unclear, though we are afforded in Livi's well-behaved relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre for the viewer (which it should not be). Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using a stage person to solve internal conflicts is interesting, although not novel or fully explored as a theme in this movie. The allusions to John Lennon were annoying, but I admit I'm not a Beatles fan. At least Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derived from them. Another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting - albeit intermediate and high-school - philosophical musings of the protagonist, but left threads of his thinking there to pick them up only in the middle of the movie very short when Livien says: "Before God there was music" (ever seen the ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "Before the time there was Tia Maria"? That's what is always in mind); It looks like an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he reached it, but he is entitled to it. Fortunately, his bassist and friend played, as Dominic Monaghan was able to recognize, that this thinking was wrong when he responded to "You Don't Know". In total, the limited forces in the direction and the foundation can go either on future projects, to a meaningless banality or in an interesting and more mature perspective.
