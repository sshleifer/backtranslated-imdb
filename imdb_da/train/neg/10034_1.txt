If there is a movie that is the worst of this year, it is TASHAN The first promo showed that the movie will be a dull Dhoom 2 style movie, and at first I knew it would be a bad movie, whether it be because of it is a Yashraj movie or maybe see the osteopremic promo But this movie gave me a shock, it was even worst than Dhoom 2 and what I expected first Saif's introduction is boring. Then meet Saif-Kareena, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor Oh god, what is he doing in such a strange movie? What is the role? What is he doing? His first scene is okay, but then his action is repeated and he overcomes. Then came Akshay, who gave some nice scenes, but then the movie became more boring and with all the obsolete things Childhood romance, overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The end is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have made 3 movies more to lead if this movie had worked, that is the strategy of yashraj, only money, nothing else. So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the movie as a fresh fresh air, in fact he gives some exciting moments Saif Ali Khan is annoying , Kareena is just as bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and destroys the show even more The rest is okay
