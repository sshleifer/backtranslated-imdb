Clich√©-ridden story of an impending divorce - or is it? - through a 6-year-old child's eyes. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no payout, either emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> Is no creative writing more? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you can't create any kind of satisfactory insult - just finish the story. I'm forced to ask, "What made you think it was a story worth telling in the first place?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted, debuted by children's games Anthony De Marco - the rest of the casting was at best forgettable. And they are wondering why no one is watching movies! This is ninety minutes of my life, I will never come back.
