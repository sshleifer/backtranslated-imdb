When I heard the plot for this movie, I simply had to see what I think whole cities are being destroyed by killed tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is just as fun as it gets. Led by detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes his SCUBA outfit off and Lt. Finletter, who is never the picture without his parachute behind) 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' is a parody of B-Movies, especially Japanese scare in the 1950s. The movie begins with a standard size tomato discovered by a woman who washes up her kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime scene when the tomato has probably murdered this lady and let me tell you that it does not get any remedies like the movie is progressing! To be fair, there are a few fun moments, for example, when Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks that his voice is called in an American accent, or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes' hello, can someone please pass the ketchup? . Likewise, this film was probably much more fun in 1978 with the whole thing so bad that it was a good concept. Unfortunately, for 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' haunting film like the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series, this kind of comedy has been released much better. The play is terrible; There is zero continuity in editing and it just feels real slow and lacks energy. In order for a parody film to work, you need a lot of things at once, one after another. The song in the movie seems meaningless, and the advertisements for the furniture store, which blink over the screen, are cursed just as bizarre, even for this movie. In the end, however, you can see why this movie is a cool one; I can't see many people care about it. Unfortunately, terrible would be the way I would sum up.
