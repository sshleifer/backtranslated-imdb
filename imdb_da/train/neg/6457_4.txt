I think I've seen worse movies, but it may be because I'm so spoiled by how standard these bad horror movies are. Killer monster stuff is really really bad, basically it's a guy in some kind of green body clothing. There is much worse deals as far as B movies go, but do not think for a second, it was some star, hell no. It actually had a plot of fabric, but was still pretty stupid. Basically, it's just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, it sucks it here The blood looks really fake in this movie. The only complaint I have about all the horrors of the new mill, low class doing, looks stupid. A good cruel death scene with really false blood is so stupid. At least there was a lovely shower scene
