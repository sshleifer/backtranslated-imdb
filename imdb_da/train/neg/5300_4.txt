I am one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and have just seen this, the episode that started it all on British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think about what ran out of this so-so movie, and I can only wonder who looked at Columbo's massive potential and added all the little details that make it such a fantastic and classic series. That said, this movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing last episode & the patronizing British episode). If Columbo had been made as the original "pilot", it would certainly not have been very long or been seen and loved the world over. In this movie, Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, runs a normal car, has a partner, doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive. There is also no cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and the "villain". Watchable, but only for the news of seeing how Columbo started.
