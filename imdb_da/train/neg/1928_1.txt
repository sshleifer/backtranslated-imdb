How Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake made with humans, was the cartoon just perfect enough, what is the purpose of this movie? But it also seemed a little strange for Jim Carrey to be Grinch. I mean he is a great comic actor, but he like Grinch? It just made no sense to me. His performance was just over the top and accidentally ridiculous at the moment. Not to mention some of the added dialogue, it was a little childish and not comfortable. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over finished and was not needed. They really just destroyed the story, the period. <br /> <br /> All those who are in Whoville get ready for their best Christmas season, but where everything is destined to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about Grinch, who lives over them, and that he's not going to be as good at a Christmas as the other one is. He kicks her out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that he really just has to steal Christmas together to show who is what his version of Christmas is about. But soon he realizes that who may know that it is a little more than what is the materialized version of Christmas. How Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and was a little over the top. I really recommend you stick to the comic for the simple fact that this is a rather disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the whole movie was just over done, not to mention how The Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be like a comic instead of a Jim Carry version. But at least this version gives you gratitude for the Boris Karloff version, which is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
