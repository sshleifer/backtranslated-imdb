I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but it was too much. The action wasn't great, but it wasn't the real problem. The question was the sinking feeling I got in my stomach for 20 minutes in the movie. These signs were hollow. They had almost no depth, and the little they had was devoted to the cruelty they appeared to each other in the fate of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give these characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cuts. These signs were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
