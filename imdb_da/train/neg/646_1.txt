I saw this movie by accident and this movie was an accident ... well it must be. blonde women are stalked, the villain appears and disappears to come from one place to another every minute, then disappears and resumes, hides. He wasn't a superhero, so I don't know how he did it. He couldn't scare a cat, and it's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> The old "mirror in the bathroom" just isn't scary anymore, in fact it stopped scary years ago. you had the police on the villain's trail, another cliché (played by idris elba with a very convincing american accent he is from London) the director did not have a clue and made a movie full of clichés and makes "scary motion" which was comedy look scary, pathetic!
