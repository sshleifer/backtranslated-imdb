Based on a self-serving novel by one-time girl friend and group of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the clubs Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck continues in shameless profits as a powerful, full-bodied or spoiled alcoholic; unlike the gentle and soft spoken Scott Fitzgerald. The focus on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing time, at the end of his life, the high-hardened author actually lived a quiet life and effectively fought for his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to reuse his flapper stories to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a used Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different from what was portrayed in this movie. Almost every 20th-century Fox movie made under Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as Almost every movie directed by Henry King was an expertise. Beloved unbelievers were the exception.
