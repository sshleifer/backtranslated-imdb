I was of Puertorican descent, had mixed fillings about this "documentary". First, I was offended that Mrs Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. Also just a fact, Mr John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent. His parents came from Columbia. Whoever examined this was not very accurate. I feel our race is progressing on education. This message should have been resounding throughout this movie. Education is our way to freedom and power. I believe that future efforts at this production team should make this their focus. In my opinion, this film swung against an anti-American mood.
