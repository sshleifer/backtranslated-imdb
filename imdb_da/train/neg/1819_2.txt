I searched this movie for a reason - Al Adamson. He is among the worst instructors all the time - right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horror. However, I was a little disappointed, because even though the film was really bad, it never came to the attack of some of his former schlocky movies. Because of that, this movie was not very fun to watch us bad movie fans. Now I was wary of watching this movie, as the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie - something I wouldn't go through on IMDb. However, this movie seemed to be this at times - especially the first 10 minutes. But one could tell that the manuscript went through many changes since too much of the movie is no titulation at all, and at the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where it is violent and certainly not sexy! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is equally good. For example, as a porn video, it shows the surprisingly small, and it is incomprehensible why they would put a 71-year-old guy in some love scenes. Sure, for a 71-year-old, Livingston met quite well - but he was still an old man, and no one wanted to see him get it on with young nymphet! So when the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingston becomes a Rambo-like guy! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is not much to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the movie manages to be quite boring even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses".
