It really doesn't matter that Superman comics are incredibly naive, and their goals are ten years old. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a question for you dear readers, how many of you actually think that Superman will be defeated by Bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Like I thought. No spoilers here. So let's get to some big problems right now. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks like commercial (scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinks Budweiser is just the scene that looks as it should). Imagine commercial for Superman, two and a half hours long. Let's be serious, it's not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You actually feel that this movie is too long. And special effects are not so special by the way. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenario is stupid. Sometimes, although something is acceptable in comics, it just looks stupid in the cinema. And so it is. Of course, dialogues are disgraceful. I can't believe anyone took money to write them. How many times will we be fed a villain to speak? How many times will the law of physics be raped? (Jesus, it's not just about the strength of the Superman, but also the resistance of materials he's dealing with.) How many times will Lois Lane be fooled by Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers search for a story in a creepy cartoon? Since it's hard to make a good story, why have a weak story for a starter? It just doesn't work. Guys, grab it. Try harder, thank you. Or just be on this strike forever, who cares. I have the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike. No offence. I do not question the lame money they are paid but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case, there is no quality at all. (At this point you can ask yourself: is it so bad? Yes it is.) Third, the action is weak, which is quite a surprise when Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects) controls. Kevin Spacey has fun, but he's the only one. The target audience is rather not in the mood for jokes. Thing is that the cartoon hero can be developed into true personality with clear motives, but also with doubts, fears, depth. In this case, no one has done that job and characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole creator of creators makes this movie parody. The other unit is so bad that attracts attention as there is nothing interesting going on the screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the more fun it gets (but it doesn't laugh, you can expect). Final conclusion? A word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular movie, ladies and gentlemen, is camp. Don't waste your time and play your money too. Stay home, read a book.
