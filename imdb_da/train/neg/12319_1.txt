I want to have just seen a snus movie .... a beautifully acted, exciting, exciting and horrible thing! A two-hour liter perversion in the most basic and all-inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, beheading, incest, corruption, live burial and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption at all. And I was entertained. I couldn't stop seeing. What does this say about me about the people who are doing and acting in this kind of thing, and a world that has been so desensitized that ultimately real snus movies will be the norm. And I am neither puritanic nor humorous, I am not trying to hide from the existence of darkness, and I certainly have not led a protected life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see that my British cousins ​​draw the subject of sewers as my own tribe does. It doesn't have to be cozy, but does it have to give way to usual sadism?
