This must be the most stupid movie I've ever seen (spoilers in front)! First, the plot is stupid. The baby is strange and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find out that the child has a gift, "Shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything except to make the baby look cool. Then the movie becomes boring and boring until the man finally gets mad. He goes on a rampage to kill the child and his wife because ... well, he has it like that. Why else would he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a dead body, which is completely disgusting. Somehow a black man comes into the hotel and is broken with an ax. Then the child and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes with hypothermia. Most movies are not a waste of time, but they fall into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except for Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the end is very predictable, the story is slow, dull and boring. This movie is extremely overstated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I am surprised that such a high rating has been achieved on IMDb.
