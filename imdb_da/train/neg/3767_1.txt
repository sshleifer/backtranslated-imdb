Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk. The effects are crap. The action is shit. The only thing that could have done this just tolerably was a little cheap T&A, and it gets ruined in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only equally redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity. It was as if they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never been cursed before. Hats off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some guy in a bad suit, just go back and look at old prom pictures. The only way for a Bigfoot flick to be good is to have a big budget and some actors who do not come from the Frogball Community Theater.
