This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie starring Kevin Costner.) Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this movie and his supporting actors didn't even look as if they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this movie, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, avoid it like the plague. Going does something constructive and more interesting than seeing the weather channel or seeing paint dry on a wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give it a 2/10! <br /> <br />
