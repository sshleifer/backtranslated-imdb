Please don't hate me, but I have to be honest, see the movie, I had fun. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with stupid throws and stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original One Holi .... well .. it was OK! Because of the tradition, each movie got one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Very UNEDEDED silly song jee Le ... Looked like a Playboy Song Dum song ... Other than songs. The movie was OK This was Ram Gopal Verma's customization ... If you think you like this movie <br /> <br /> Just this movie. Depending on the viewer and, in his opinion, whether he / she believes this movie is a total copy he / she would like to hit her head at the cinema or if he / she thinks of the directors themselves he / she would be relaxed and look at this movie < br /> Anyways I looked in both ways, I would congratulate and abuse Ram Gopal for this disaster that he made ... Well, some other things that bothered that CAST were incredibly bad <br /> < br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own movie Remake Fun, what was the director thinking) Ajay Devgan Like Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol Could Have Been Better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek Was For This Role Despite making a Special Appearance in the Mehbooba song) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was Right Tabu was right for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would have been great) Mohanlal Like Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so sweet .... Oops Sorry, huh hehehe, he was ok, i couldn't think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The Movie would even have FAIRED a Listen if Cast was ok <br /> <br /> I wasn't even thrilling, the movie was just ok, just to see <br /> <br /> Overall rating <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I got him some credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3 / 10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 Unnecessary in the movie, could have been better, Easy on the Ears being played on PCs and iPod and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
