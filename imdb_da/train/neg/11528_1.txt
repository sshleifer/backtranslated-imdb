The one who wrote the "nice" post about this must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for backyard crossing. In fact, it's not even backyard crossing, it's a couple of guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Each guy is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this. It's just some bored children who even give the yard a bad name, if possible. If you want to see some entertaining backyard crossings, you need to retrieve backyard a pleasure for pain. It comes from the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have actually gone since yarding it and were professionally trained as "real" pro wrestlers. They went legit and got better. I recommend checking out these 2 guys. MDogg is crazy and out of the hook. So don't play your time or money on this crappy DVD, there are "better" backyard videos out there.
