What can I say. A Kamal Hassan movie is horrible. He seems very good, but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction. In my kind opinion, the director Gautham Menon has to stop running. There are a lot of tragedies throughout the film. Apart from that, you just can't believe how true the terrible crimes were. There was no practical in the movie. Gautham is just running out of stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika work really well. The bad guys look too ugly, even though their performance was not bad. I don't think it's a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that you can see with the family. You can't sleep watching this movie !! But Harris Jayaraj did a good job again and therefore I have given this movie 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is soulful and soothing. Apart from that, good filmography. On the whole, it's just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hassan should have rejected this film.
