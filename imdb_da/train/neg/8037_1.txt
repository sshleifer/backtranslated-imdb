OK, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid slasher movie. <br /> <br /> We got your stereotypical teenagers in a house that went. We have an FBI agent who has seen Dirty Harry once for many. "So what's the secret .... punks?" We have about 4 different small camera shots and scene that makes no sense at all. "Hey man, I'm fixing the sprinklers" ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there's a preacher tied on a couch that sees home movies he's being killed. <br /> <br /> They follow the killer in the middle of nothing, without the police. Suddenly she is in a church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear that this is the stupid slasher movie I've ever seen.
