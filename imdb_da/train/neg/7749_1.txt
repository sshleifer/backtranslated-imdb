This movie should never have been made. From the poorly finished animation, besides bad acting. I'm not sure when the people behind this movie said "Okay, it looks good! Let's do it!" I was in awe of how really horrid this movie was. At a time that may well have been the WORST point, a computer-generated saber of gold falls from the roof, sticking the cat fighter's creator into his mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The movie's villain was a paralyzed sabretooth who was killed within minutes of its first appearance. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before they are burned and shot down. Then there is a coincidence waiting for victims in the jungle ... who scares me for a single reason. Will there be two? God, for man's sake everywhere I hope not. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure waste. From powerpoint, credits to the slideshow save ends.
