Well, I hated the beat up, I despised 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a worthless piece of garbage game. Do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit, I do not like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the cover of the DVD, I was like "I didn't like the movie" but after his insistence, I decided to try it, unfortunately . <br /> <br /> About Two minutes in the movie I struck it off, I was so offended. it's just disgusting. Any decent person would be offended by filth in this movie. Call me old-fashioned, but push your pussy juice-covered hand into your friend's face so he will know that you "have some" over the line of decency, in my opinion. Yes, this is how this rugged little movie begins, and I can only imagine it getting much worse from there. another real winner for Mr Rudd. I bet he is proud as a blow. Imagine if you could only get worthless roles he gets, would you stay in movies? in spite of the salary, I would not. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; next time I want to.
