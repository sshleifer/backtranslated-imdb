I will spend as much time on this review as the authors did on the script. This is easily the WORST sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance GOD-AWFUL, so everyone was elses !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The manuscript appeared to be written by Mongolian monkeys using the pen's name Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to squeeze out such a weak cinematic excrement is beyond me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talented buffoon. Director Michael Schultz was ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want the 96 minutes in my life, I spent watching this famous memory of a brilliant comedy back so I can try to judge everyone involved in this cinematic cruelty.
