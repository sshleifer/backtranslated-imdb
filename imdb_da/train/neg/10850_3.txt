This movie has a few things to go to just outside the bats. Having Dani Filth as a leading actor will automatically make some people like this movie. Admittedly, I love the Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I saw it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and gives good leadership. The independent film in the film is great for the scary factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. To be low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways people died were very creative and nightmare. <br /> <br /> Now to the disadvantages. There is very little to talk throughout this film, which makes it very small in terms of character development. It's hard to fear the lives of slender, static signs. As there was little talk, the F bomb was plentiful and popped up in random places. Yes, I understand people swear, but it seems a preteen boy wrote this and thought coolly to include all the language. The story of what I could do about it was pretty good, though many parts are left, and the lack of conversation often leaves you wondering what is happening. <br /> <br /> Finally, Cradle of Fear is like a porno to people who love sex and violence, but as a porn trying to draw on a story, it just doesn't work for good. However, rent it if you are a morbid person seeking to put your blood and meat appetite.
