WOW! Why would anyone make a sequel to an already rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least one had an idea of ​​what it would be. HPD2 has no idea what it will be. It only exists on the screen for reasons I cannot explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison, where there may be a box filled with gold stones buried. In prison, a riot breaks between rival inmates, one of whom is shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez is planning his escape. During a conjugal visit, Twitch's fiancé and Burkes (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and held in an execution room. Burke reluctantly turns Twitch and they end up in trouble with the idiotic inmates as they find out that Cortez has their loved ones. Opinion: This is the most unnecessary successor since Universal Soldier: The Return. The scripture is horrible, the play is terrible, the dialogue is a joke, and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was a low budget film, but it's not an excuse for these guys not to take action on what they do. No one in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. No one in this "movie can be taken seriously as an actor." Kurupt was ashamed of himself. His character "Twitch" is basically a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time making up while being hit by Burke or the other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sucking the whole movie as if he were to take a PHD (pretty big dump). The fighting sequences are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when an action happens! Don't let anyone tell you that this movie is decent. It stinks and is a primary reason why people despise Follywood.
