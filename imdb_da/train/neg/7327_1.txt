Powerful moralism. Authors use signs as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable, plodding plot points (say it five times fast). A child's imitation of Britney Spears. This movie has all ear tags for a Lifetime Special Rejection. I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set up to create a thought-provoking, emotional movie on a hard topic, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that who is a criminal per. definition, is not necessarily a bad person, and that there may be mitigating circumstances, especially when one first sets a child's welfare. However, their seriousness ends up being channeled into preaching dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot together. The decent production values ​​and interesting use of documentary film recordings are not enough to reach their goals when the manuscript and play fall flat. Logic is often compromised to create excitement: Soid first tries to challenge Pablo to join her documentary instead of helping them escape, so in the same breath, he basically does not tell you to trust her because she does not help them out of altruism. Oh, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is too swayed by a temper tantrum. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he escapes capture and imprisonment or expulsion for her, but he is willing to risk everything to appease her when she does not want to travel to Mexico. Right. Talk about over-permissive parents. Third, when Pablo's employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright, is she remarkably unprofessional, especially considering her seniority - did she really think she was convincing? Oh, yes, I would have settled in. CCH Pounder's Detective Wims could dry the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be fair I would like to list the things I liked. Um, I liked the midget. And I liked that the midget is called Sexy. There is cross-dressing, always a plus; juvenile cross-dressing, no less! Harry is infinitely shorter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie should be when Cristina kicks Detective Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that in a strong minority cast (which I greatly appreciate) the black character is the racist. It's wrong, it's just thrown out there and no longer explored. <br /> <br /> There is a characteristic, unconventional score, but nonetheless, it is generally context-specific, does not enhance mood or excitement in any scene, except the pathetic, horrible complaints every time the protagonist is in anxiety as if they think his play does not show it enough: "Only if you were not sure, he is sad, and we have the musical signs to prove it." <br /> <br /> Silent, cliché dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtitles; everything must be spelled out in dialogue, even when the body language has been up to then convey it just fine. For example, every spooky speech, Pablo, and Mrs Knights' regret is that her child will not crawl into bed with them in the morning. "Papi, tell me about Mama again" - what shameless, blatant exhibition introducing the generic dead wife! (She's always the most beautiful woman the widower ever saw, the best he'd ever met. Why can't we see a man crying over a woman like Shakespeare's - she can be fat, ugly, unpleasant, but his love for her is deep as oceans, now it's a story that would move me.) Police always literally a step behind them gives many scenes the excellent feeling of the French father. The most boring foot ever hunting - Light and Light are so out-of-shape and lightly fooled (he's certainly not quick as lightning, and she doesn't feel like spelling things out). Any guy who pulls together with a young child running out on a bike race, complete with macho cyclists who choose a fight, but then fell off by a child? Quoting Margaret Cho is so sad. Will we ever see this on 'Cops'? Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: As an employer, would you really refrain from checking out his green card just because he can quote the author of inspirational sayings on a poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> Plus, several scenes, including the above, threaten to turn to porn: "Well, I'll do this service for you as long as you do something for me ..." I can almost hear bowm -chicka-bowm-bowmen. <br /> <br /> When the parents see footage shot of Pablo's remorse, the mourning mother's freak-out is the most real movie feel. her emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic, a more ambivalent look would be more convincing here. dead girl grave. And why does the mother not recognize her face when she saw him before he drove away? "" You seem terribly familiar ... "<br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the completely unnecessary, little free scene with Soid and the artificially improved bartender? Tch too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary features that never went anywhere, Detective Lightning says skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio showing how little he really knows about the occult. And I don't think faith in destiny fully qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright keeps Pablo as he dies - wait, why does she care now? Her character is as inconsistent as Soid's. What should she shoot him just because she said 'Stop or I'll shoot'? (She's worried about her integrity so far.) He was unarmed. There was no need for deadly force. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's childhood acceptance of his mother's death has given Dr. Knight's peace over his daughter's death - so forced. And the fate of the family whose child was killed became Cristina's new family ... It attacks me that she could be a "replacement" for their little girl. It is also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. I'm not saying there is no generous love for people who would do it. I'm just saying that the characters here have never been developed far enough to believe they would. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements in moments that do not grow sentimental in a way. <br /> <br /> Co-author, co-director, co-star Nebot himself said he had too many hats during this production. Too many cooks can destroy the broth, but a cook alone may end up making a post-school. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the movie's title has less to do with history and more to do with feeling of regret, helplessness, and loss that accompanies the revelation that you will never see your money again.
