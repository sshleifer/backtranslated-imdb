I can't remember going out of a movie theater except this time. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, characters made of clay, violence without significance. I didn't care when the good guys died; It didn't matter when the evil guys got it. Fantasy and magic were laid thick as liver pudding, and there was no connection. In short, good entertainment if you happen to spend an eternity in hell.
