From the first time I saw the film cover on the film and the extensive photograph, I thought this guy, this friend of "Scwarz" must be like 6 feet or 6ft 2in. <br /> <br /> Not 5 meters high. It's not his fault. <br /> <br /> In every review I hit the movie a cool evening in Tucson, out on the second story deck with a good cigar and let it roll. At that time, my wife had an affair and things went down the hill for me so I needed a good diversion. But just as bad as the movie was ... I totally enjoyed it, even with a bottle of Merlot. <br /> <br /> I have really seen this movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not that it's trying too hard to be cool, or that 'It's so close' to hit the mark for an action movie .... It's boring. And so really clueless. So hectic again. It's the best of the best when it comes to a slow-speed hunting scene. Wow !! I have never felt safer in my life. Warm and happy too. I was grateful that they preserved the gasoline during the hunt, due to less production in the summer months ... anywho the direction was "uninspired" the actions and fighting sequences that were to be choreographed, or re-choreographed and tightened, the sound was from delivery not hit You, it just kept going, the other way. The locals in the village they were in, the town was rather 'off cue', they also didn't seem to follow what happened very well, it would see and even 'stare' into the camera lens. As a deer in the head, only some of them light with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because the 'Columbu' I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own compatriots. <br /> <br /> But "Baretta's Island" is very blunt and incredible. I still like it a lot. My now x wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, I'm pretty discriminatory when it comes to movies I like or even 'love'. All in all, I like Franco. So there it is. <br /> <br /> As a movie adding a supplement to this, if you like to kill a couple of hours of really fun watching, just for video B movies or 'bad' movies for your little library collection so if you can find it, check out 'The Big Sweat' (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar. You know the big guy from 'TANGO & CASH'. 'The Big Sweat', a bomb of a police history without real plot discovery and acting that is so boring, it might as well be 'on crutches' and at the end of 'The Big Sweat' I think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just put it on fire and let it burn under the credits. - Good fun. <br /> <br /> But all in all, not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave it a '1' and an overall rating of 'horrible' for horrible good B movies. I am waiting for the successor, perhaps as 'Baretta's revenge on Montazuma' (Franco takes a Mexican holiday and gets sick on the water and declares war on the water queue.) Or 'Baretta's powder war' where he would stick out a great master of his land and chemical genetic engineering and creating a hybrid super insect (insect) that will be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eating cola and by passing it through the bay it constitutes a chemical reaction that turns coke into pure powdered sugar. Then another successor would have the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could get a larger toothpaste company to approve and part finance the project with careful product placement in the function. Right?(*)
