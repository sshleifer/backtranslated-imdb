The thumb idea is not such a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. First of all, I think Mr Oedekerk had much less to work with in the Titanic broadcast. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has not (yet?) Been a cultural myth, and there are far fewer references to be made that will resonate with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the gaps are filled with even jokes that don't really seem to be related to anything. For example, the hero's insight that the heroine is not clean under the ship's "jump out of the end" - is not fun. Instead, you think of yourself, "Have I missed something in the original movie?". There were too many of these types of basic jokes (cf. Arachnid). In contrast, the sending of the fancy ship designer had importance and was fun. It was also very fun to broadcast the block in the movie that wanted to go "faster" as a madman runs around demanding * everything * be "faster" including the ship's sight and even the first to die. These kinds of jokes meant something in the titanic context and lent meaningful humor to Thumbtanic. The thumb "media", the faces and the voices are still entertaining. Props and sets and CG animation are appreciated. All in all, though ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone will not work, this filmmate still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end.
