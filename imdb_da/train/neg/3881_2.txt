A few days ago I looked at a documentary called THE FIFTY WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME, and this was where I first heard about the INCREDIBLE MEAL MAN. Being a lover of schlocky movies, I make it an attempt to find some of the films from the documentary - not just the INCREDIBLE MESSAGE MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since then and I have to say I'm a little disappointed. Although it really is a bad movie, it does not come close enough to include in this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before I have seen the documentary, I have had "bad movies" ever since I read the book "The Femogde Worst Movie of All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book came out long before the documentary film and documentaries decision makers credited Medved with the concept. From Medvedbogen I have seen about 35 of the 50 films, but have come to a dead end - the rest of the films are just not available on VHS or DVD. So I thought I'd try the movie with the same name. The reason I was most disappointed with the INCREDIBLE MEAL MAN was that there were a few good things for the movie. First of all, the special effects of melting pine were generally very tough and obnoxious. It is obvious that a professional (the famous Rich Baker) was involved in making this look realistic. However, I also point out that there were more than a few cheap and cheese-efficient effects - like the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut off - you could see it "wisely hidden" under his clothes ! As for history, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrate Saturn's rings without being crushed. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is - as we see close-ups of it. This is strange as Saturn is so far from it - it should NOT look like this - it should be a big speck. Whatever the case, the scene changes immediately and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, it's anyone's guess. Soon after, survivors survive and engage in a murderous rampage that the whole body melts. Now, are they considering a psycho that runs like a melting popsicle, would you think the government would pull all the stops to find and stop him, right?! Wrong. A general engages a single doctor to find him !! No army, no police - just a dopey doctor. Even after the organs start stacking, the doctor or general does nothing to organize a meaningful search or backup. <br /> <br /> Now, in view of the stupidity of the movie, you won't be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the merchant runs around the hospital, the doctor gives his wife a strong soothing and leaving her in the house. <br /> <br /> When a cute old couple runs late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to pick fruit and get killed. <br /> <br /> When a woman looks melting guy, she barricades the door to protect herself. This would be smart if she didn't have the back door to the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and fleeing, she just waits! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take snapshots, the guy takes his assistant and yanks from her top. Why? Well to give the audience a cheap excitement and make it a rated R-flick. <br /> <br /> When the melting guy is finally placed and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him - even though he now knows the monster had killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the movie is teeming with silly record elements. It's a very bad movie. But given the occasional good special effects, it was just not a horrible movie I had hoped for. Sure, it's good to laugh, but not how close to PLAN 9 FROM Outer Space in badness and never should have been on anyone's worst movie list.
