"Smokey And The Bandit" wasn't exactly Shakespeare, but then no one would be. It was lowdown slapstick, but it had brains. It had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. People came out of the theater smiling. "Hooper" does not give any of this. There is no need to smile. If it were to be a tribute to the Hollywood Stuntman, it made them look very lazy by giving nothing but badly choreographed combat scenes and one of the most compelling leaps I have ever seen. It all looks fake, badly filmed almost intentionally. Bad Sally Field (as a boyfriend who twists his hands on the sidelines) gets his weakest role, with not a single fun or smart line ("If you make it leap, I won't be here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds keeps a look at the camera and blinks, but joke is on any audience sitting through "Hooper". * from ****
