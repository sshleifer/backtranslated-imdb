Oh oh! Another gay movie. This time it shows the black side. Bet your last dollar it will get an unhappy ending! But why? With only less than half a dozen exceptions, ALL homosexuals must end in death or an "addio" final. It is like all European Film Noir releases in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The management ... man or woman must die or drive alone in oblivion. Why in the name of God do writers, directors and producers have the audience leave the sense of theater depressed? After all, it must be gay ... not glum. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' movie. A large percentage of homosexual relationships make the last one, and the couples join together in the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows the lower side of gay life and gives the wrong impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves me. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here comes another gay movie! It is wrong!
