Most of the episodes in season 1 are terrible. There is no comparison with Twilight Zone or External Borders, as the programs actually had decent history lines. Most of the amazing stories are well boring .. not great at least .. Do hire or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard Season 2 in this series is much better .. also for some reason on the DVDs cut out the Ray Walston parts which further reduce this compilation. The one cool thing is watching actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... However, most of the lines of history are very predictable, and the series could have been better with terms that left you wondering ...
