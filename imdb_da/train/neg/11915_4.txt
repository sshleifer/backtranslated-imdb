This obvious pilot for an unpublished television series has the young Canadian actor Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some rather incredible powers to be used for when a man-turning demon is lost to the world. CGI is a couple for a television job, and Appleby is OK as amnesiac, but hard to swallow as superheroine. The well-known television face Richard Burgi is together to run as Appleby's mentor, but he can't do anything to raise this killing over the mediocre level. We look too much out of the cartoon-like flying demon right from the start, a bad sign. Also, the scenes where Burgi coaches Appleby for battle is actually ridiculous. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
