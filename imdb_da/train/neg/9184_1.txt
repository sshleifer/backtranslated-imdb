F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrible movies in my time, but it takes p * ss! Honestly, I can't express in words how bad this movie really is. In addition to the plot that is not there, the comic scream that works, the hilarious excuse for zombies; You know what I could do all day. Every little thing in this movie is either stupid, meaningless, shameful or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ... not! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say I have this on my rack. It is tucked away just by the god-damned bottom of the huge pile. I couldn't even give this horse sh * t excuse for a movie away. It's so bad it is.
