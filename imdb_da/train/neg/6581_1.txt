I rented "New Best Friend" and hoped for a movie that looked like cozy teenagers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The Crowd" where there is no excitement and the play is incredibly false. "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events under the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
