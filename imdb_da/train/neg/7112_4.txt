Now I have to admit that this was one of my favorites as a child, when I used to watch it on a home projector as a super-8 reel. Now, there is not much to recommend it, except for the intrinsic camp value of actors being "scared" by copies of human skulls. The special effects are rather stupid, consisting mainly of skulls on wires and superimposed "ghost images". But there is something to be said about the sets. The great manor house where it takes place is pretty scary, especially since it is mostly unfurnished (probably due to budgetary reasons?). It inspires more laughs than screams. Just try not to get giggles when the wife (who does more than her share of screaming) enters the greenhouse and faces the ghost of her husband's ex.
