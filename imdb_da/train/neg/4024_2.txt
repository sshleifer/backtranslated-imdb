This movie is just plain horrible. The bad John Savage had to bend this low to be in another movie. He comes as a rare type of vampire to help a lady who looks like a lash and thrown in the streets dancing at a local strip club. Unfortunately, she tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of the rare vampires as they are carried away and pull out on the changing room floor. Savage is then awarded by a short leader of this rare vampire race that resembles a cross between 80s punk rock and one of Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just gets too crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider upside down, also one of the rare ones. He quotes Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante, and I just had to laugh. This only gets rediculas. And so are the most brutal special effects they can come to mean that Corri throws his organs and pulls them out of his mouth. And you can tell that everything is falling. Her son does not know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object object. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me I do, but I just heard this. Even the shooting stinks in and out blurs with the camera shifts this way, and trying to make it look like the vampires are moving too fast for the camera to stop and then the camera gets too bright in the Savage scene following the son of Corri around until he blinds himself. Avoid this!
