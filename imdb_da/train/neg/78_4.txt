The annoying mouse and lullaby really came to me and really had nothing to do with the story ... It was something I would have done my 1st year in the film school. Very sad. In addition, the story just seemed to draw on for no apparent reason ... there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with history, making me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just it should have been shorter ... which would have been a blessing, not a crime. Having just seen all the episodes up to this point during the last week ... I had to say that this was by far the worst and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
