This movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for Christmas. It looks very much like the first Gozilla movie, and as that movie, scenes with American actors have deployed without any real reason. An interesting thing about the deployed scenes is that there is a war war pension depicted between America and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rage all over the world, attaching great importance to Tokyo because there is no great monster movie unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, it's an okay movie. Some of the scenes involving Gamera, especially the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you really get a kick out of this. I give it a 4 out of 10. Had this been the unformed Japanese version that I saw, it would probably have got a 5.
