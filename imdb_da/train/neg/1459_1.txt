This is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of Adolf Hitler's early days that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but throwing him as Hitler is simply wrong. To cast Liev Schrieber as Hitler's long-standing friend and help, Haefengstal must have published screams of despair and anxiety from Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W plays a Nazi supporter, bad poor bad casting. This was not an enjoyable family movie with a good historical background. This was Hollywood waste at its best and deposited on the basis of a strong (but very under-utilized) supportive cast of actors who seemed to have all disappeared from the functioning radar over the past 5 years. <br /> <br /> The fake German accents (vee vill vin zis var) are insulting to German people everywhere. My mother is German and she sits fuming at the sound of the voices, which continued to change from American / English / German all in the same sentence. The support casting provides better cardboard cutouts on the local video store than they do on the screen. Jenna Malone as the fate of Geli Raubal was amazing, but caught the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in Hitler's shadow. <br /> <br /> If you want an incredibly amazing and historically accurate account of Hitler's early years leading up to and including the war / holocaust, "Inside the Third Reich" rents in 1983 with Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and more sensible then this baloney. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher from the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you it had reached my books to confirm its countless inaccuracies.
