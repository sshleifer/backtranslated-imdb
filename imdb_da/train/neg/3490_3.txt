Having enjoyed Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was topped, so I tried to sit through this second-string scrub around a study of a jockey's death - but I didn't make it to the end. Arthur, photographed in a gauzy movie magazine mode, wants either alimony from former man William Powell or another shot in marriage, but I've never felt for her because the character is just a series of wisecracks (she is the type of heroine who tends to comic curiosity, but once inside a gazebo - like all women in these '30's comedies - she fails). William Powell had reportedly been busy working with Miss Arthur, but you would never know it from the end result; They look awkwardly standing next to each other, hesitant about their junk. The actor who plays Powell's companion is unwavering, and the pauses for the viewer laughing are pregnant with unrest.
