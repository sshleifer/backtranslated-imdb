A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide. It leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking many questions ... and blaming himself. <br /> <br /> Good idea, poorly handled. Initially, it has been done before 1988 - mainly in television films and post-school services. Apart from difficult and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating) this did not add anything new. The result is predictable, and Reeves attempt to act was really painful to see. He is good NU, but not in 1988. Apart from the fact that his character was dressed as a slob and always so dirty, it was difficult to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> Apart from the movie, it's boring. I saw every scene come and every "surprise" was telegraphed. I could hardly wait for this to come over. <br /> <br /> I have a vague reminder to see it in a theater in 1988 and hate it (the bombed BADLY). It still looks miserable almost 20 years later. The topic is worth dealing with, but it has been made better (with better acting) in countless other films. "Ordinary people" come to mind. You can skip this one.
