Hood of the Living Dead and all the other movies these guys directed look like they came together and filmed this with their friends who have zero talent one afternoon as they get bored (lines are totally untouched and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video recordings are better than this movie (although the similarities between them justify the comparison). "Hi lets see if anyone is stupid enough to buy our movie!". Hopefully no one else was. My apologies to those involved in the tab, since this review is a bit tough, but I was dope reading your fake reviews and bought the movie.
