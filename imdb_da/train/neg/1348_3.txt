this animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very weak and there is a little action.most of the characters are a little for nothing to do. It is easy to see, but only straight and not far from the caliber of the 80's animated television show. It's not a movie that bears repeating view, at least in my heart. It's only about 74 minutes long including credits, so I guess that's a good thing. Unique in the TV show, the characters are not worth rooting for here. On the show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who, who really cares? Anyway, it's just my opinion. For me Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing 3/10
