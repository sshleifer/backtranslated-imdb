Born again is a sub-standard episode from Season 1. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly. I have never been great at reincarnation and it could be part of my apathy to this episode. It refers to the Tooms case, which is a good continuation from the previous episode. But positive ends there. It is unfortunate because it happens at the start of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead guy would choose to reincarnate in the body of a completely independent girl. And he waits until the girl gets eight to start demanding revenge. There is even a serious lack of witty Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode off. If you are in reincarnation, perhaps this episode is up in your alley. If you are not, you can at least learn what bradycardia is.
