I thought before I started with this movie that it could be a good one, but when I started it, I found it really terrible. They said that movies were made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film is shot in India. You can see Indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bislery (an indian watermark), hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * it's really fun and many more things that turn out not to be shot in Afghanistan. I think you should not waste your time watching this movie .. pure time waste .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or maybe maybe the heart is better idea but don't see this a waste of time
