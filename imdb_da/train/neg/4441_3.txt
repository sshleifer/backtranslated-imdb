"Triumph of Love" is evidence that not all Comédie-Française writers using cross-dressing disguised courtship as Shakespeare are worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps there was something lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright, of which Brittannica says: "His nuanced feelings and wise word play became known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino is having fun mixing three mixed romances, her pant's role wasn't even up to Cherubino in "Marriage of Figaro." The herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to suggest that many features were needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> Best was the Fiona Shaw as the fool's spinster as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The glimpses of the audience we see and close the curtain call to blink that this is all artifice doesn't really help. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/29/2002)
