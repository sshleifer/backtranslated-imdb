If you can imagine Mickey Mouse like New York Street Pimp, or John Wayne as a Communist Spy, then you may think of Pat Boone as a youth offender on his uncle's Kentucky farm and you would like to enjoy this movie. <br /> This film is so stupid that it is not even campy for a mid-1950s sexually-loving love story. And the problem is that Hollywood agreed so much about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman who is not his wife on the screen before the publication knows that the audience knows he doesn't want to kiss Shirley Jones so you can't build anyone expectation of "screen-completion" of their love. It's like seeing a western part where the cowboys don't have guns. The story is meaningless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. April Love belongs to the worst movie dealer box along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from outer space.
