Flaming Saddles! It is a battle between two foreign brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), who can both fire fires mentally; the squares over childhood differences, with expensive love-interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the TV whiz child behind "Moonlighting") forges the dark-structured comedy in Vince Gillig's manuscript with a presentation that is so beautiful. The movie looks like an entry from an over-enthusiastic movie student on a fifteen million dollar contribution. It has the stinging energy of a great commercial feature, but a formless style that does not make any of the characters except their cooked eccentricities. These are not even signs, they are plot functions. Hardly released for theaters, the movie is a disaster, though strictly as an example of style over fabric it looks good. Winger is the only stand-out in a throw that looks really confused. * 1/2 from ****
