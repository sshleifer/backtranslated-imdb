The name "cult film" is often given to movies that are still screened or sold in home environment format, more than a generation after they were first released. Superchick, which was first released in 1973, now comes into this category. Its cult status is largely due to the ongoing interest of the women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> In spite of the Superwoman connotation, "Superchick" is not a cartoon character, but a very competent young lady working as an airplane - a career setting commonly considered in the 1970s as one of the most glamorous open to any girl, and which also allows her to imitate the traditional party lotion that allegedly has a wife in each port. Having a black belt status in karate, she is able to make it quite clear that she is very pleased with her undergraduate understanding and is by no means left to any of her extensive suite of male admirers. This movie is a situation of comedy that avoids the generally much shorter direct farce lifetime competition. Its appeal to feminists is also raised by a climax where our heroine uses his karate skills to avert a hijacking and rescue all the other passengers on her aircraft from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners, the director has wisely ensured that it is frosty with eye-catching. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very easy to see comedy that they will soon forget after viewing. It is so forgetful that they will find it just as fun if you see again in a year's time; Despite its age, it can still retain its status as a cult movie in the future. But the dialogue and action would make it difficult to give this movie a rating of more than 4/10.
