Starting with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a scam. A stereotype after the other acted this movie about nothing - at least nothing new. After 10-15 minutes you realize that you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite through another cop-flick. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of the corrupt system in some city, all secretly backed by the backbone business and the city, is acting in a watchful eye of some hot-shot politicians. The almighty and supreme law organization is called FRAT and guess what? They have a kick-ass loony cop shooting and turning on will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. FRAT police are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes discovered by a young and talented journalist. An hour later, after a series of unusually poorly-crafted scenes and more stereotypical lines, everything ends happily and we are served the final line: You can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 mins!
