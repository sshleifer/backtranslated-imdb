I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was useful for understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses - rewrites, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply underscores how bad this movie is. And my panic criticism is not personalized, but simply a warning that it does not cut. It can be seen, but barely enough. There are plot holes in each corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the end is telegraphed one kilometer away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram that interacts with a reconstruction team is drowned in silly dialogue as who makes a meal in the midst of what is to be an exciting and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would you confuse some of the Hamburger Helper Sally between us being killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently, this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic pipeline arms has no access to MREs. When they enter the last rooms, they treat the place more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting zone. The rationale for meeting the terrible smoke is that it cannot be killed individually. But only one scene since, the hero made the case that King surrendered it to do just that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands down the best-traded character in the movie. But that doesn't say much.
