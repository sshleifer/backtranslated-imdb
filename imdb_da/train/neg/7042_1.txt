This should be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker film, it is rock bottom. The minimal plot involves a bikerbike that takes over a small town (where original!) And the city's population is trying to fight them. Why don't they encourage outside help? Who knows? The battle scenes are, of course, false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it, but both have a little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understandably) This film belongs to the trash bin!
