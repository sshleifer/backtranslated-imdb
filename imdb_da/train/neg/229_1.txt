Captured this at the IFC yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were anything but? Kate tells Jed that she could be fired because she was to be a pillar of society, but set out for him! Then they suddenly decide they are in love? And she's so devastated by her death, she's not going to her funeral, much less, telling her family the "good news"! By the way, how could an American be the head of a real British school? Janine should have been kicked by the power of her irresponsible abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she wins out with a con, she invited to question! And the less said about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> Regarding blame, Janine and Molly feel like Jed, thank you! It's the punk's own damn mistake, he was turned into a roadkill! Where's the blame for poor Gerald, who's being fucked on? If I could only do the same with bozos behind this "movie"!
