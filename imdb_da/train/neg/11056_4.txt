I was so disappointed with this movie. I don't know much about the true story, so I was eager to watch it play on movies and educate me on a little story. With such a strong true story and great actors, it seemed like a surefire combination. Well, somewhere, the manuscript depicted them. It was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to incorporate all these things into a good story, but this movie wasn't. I became cold to see signs that were unlikely due to their disability, but because of their personalities. Other small grips: 1. The powerful soundtrack. It's seventies - we already get it! 2. If he is such a phenomenal public speaker, why were we not treated more than a piece here and there - and even then most for assembly?
