I rented End Game, which has never heard of it, but I love political thrillers, so I thought I'd give it a shot. After making some studies of the movie, I found out that it was originally intended for theatrical releases, but instead went to DVD. After seeing it, I think, "no wonder". The movie is shocking in its unoriginality. The reason and signs are perfunctory. I figured whodunnit at the halfway mark, but the end was a curve ball. I have to say I didn't expect it to end the way it did, but it's not a point in favor of it. The more predictable ending would have been preferable for one who is so poor. Perhaps the filmmakers saw how predictable the movie was, and then they decided to throw - even one made movies even worse. Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
