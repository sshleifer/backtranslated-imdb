I really hate this delayed show, the sugar! great time, and I personally think that it is insulting to bold (if you believe in fairies there); I think the people who had come up with such a villain should have the head to investigate what? and also there is a lot of brittleness (the evil school teacher that I think gets really old) and also stupidity (the boy's parents and fairy godfather) in this show - two of the things that I had and loathhe in the whole world ). Overall I say that this show is so f ***** 'annoying and should not be seen by curious eyes on ALL (it would make them soft to death)!
