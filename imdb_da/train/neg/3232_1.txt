This movie has no plot, no sign development and no budget. It really sucks to put it in the short term. Since there is no development for the film, it may not even be seen as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons for possibly seeing it. Being shocked or getting out on it like a sick little freak. Now it also falls here. The girl's reactions just seem stupid. it is extremely easy to tell that it is false (honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the villain they are trying to include in this movie. They throw indards on her but she mostly sleeps so it's just a little really good value is the end when they are quickly cut from stage to stage just before the needle goes in. But frankly, the girl is extremely nasty and everything is incredibly fake except for the eye. 2. Not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also a real story that draws you in and makes you interested in the people.The Plus tow films really work at a deeper level considering themes such as aliens American fears, moral issues Testing how far a person can walk, human instincts vs. civilization and many other things, plus they are carefully written and contain good humor when the story is not focused on violence. one piece of crap
