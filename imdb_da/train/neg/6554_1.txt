I wouldn't give this movie a rating, it's not worth it. I only saw it because I am a Pfieffer fan. I love her and wanted to see everything she did. Even in this dud she did not disappoint. Every scene with her in it, the viewer kept waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing ever did. It had some good story lines, but they ended abruptly as soon as it started. Some of the other characters had potential, but nothing was there. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when she made this movie and on her most lovely. Wardrobe and sets were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can see pretty much anything and rarely come across a movie, I can't find anything to like about it, but it was a dud. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it was a big cliff at the end. It had an end scene that woke you up and say wow, this movie has finally gone somewhere so the credits roll. My Goodness. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and seeing my cats eat would have been more exciting. Well said. In fact, this comment was more entertaining than the movie because it sums it up so well. I also wasted 0.99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
