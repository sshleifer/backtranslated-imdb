I bought this movie at a car sales sale, so I didn't expect to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be pretty pleasant to see . However, it didn't seem to be fun at all, but instead the actor and the general movie were mock-able, like the ways the "unseen killer" kills his victims, and how all those killed just are casual young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blonde women at risk, the majority are killed. 2) You survive by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> By using three simple points, I've saved you two odd hours by summarizing this bad excuse for a horror movie so you're now lucky enough not to see it.
