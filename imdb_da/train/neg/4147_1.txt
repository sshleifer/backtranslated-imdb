I'm an avid fan of horrible movies, something cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit, I went to the local rental shop and found vampires against zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know no one in the world could pull anything like it, it just got to be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy is it BAD. After watching this horror-ific movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my friend sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us considering the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words, "... guy .... what?" Yes, I am an enthralling person. <br /> <br /> Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none at all, all the time, in "WTF" mode. The characters; No development, forgettable. The music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Their vampires? The zombies; Their Zombies? <br /> <br /> Finally; Everyone should watch this movie, honestly, it's so bad I long to see it again. So do yourself a favor, see it and get depressed.
