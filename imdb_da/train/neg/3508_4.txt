Despite the overwhelming cult that follows for this sad "documentary", I must admit that I have heartily mocked the movie that hit our party so far more a disturbing exploit than useful informative. Having said that, having seen the magnificent stage of musical pull from it, one can appreciate what the film could have been in better hands. <br /> <br /> A suspicion that many of us, who actively suffered from the movie, may have had some campy delights, the gruesome fans are spoiled by the unpleasant suspicion that too many of us - or them We know - only a flaw or two away from the regrettable situation of the two crazy women depicted, who live and contribute to an imbalance, they seem unable to control or flee. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and, unlike musical, offer no warning lines or explanations, only a horror show that is not restored by humor or insight. <br /> <br /> This soul, which crushes the smoothness of the film, makes it even more remarkable to achieve the scene version (hopefully being filmed eventually for cable). Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion, but strangely putting the inmates' inmates into music, the human tragedy raises art. More importantly, this action takes place with a fine law I, where we meet the women before their decency in mutually activated frenzy and offered hints on how their isolated purgatory came. In short, all that FILM lacks. <br /> <br /> For filmmakers' credit (or their successors) includes the excellent Criterion DVD release out-take and bonus material that partially redeems the main movie - behind scenes photographs, interviews, and comments - filling some of the blank spots on it Original editing deliberately decided to omit in its run for unadulterated horror and depression. They cannot make the amateur film themselves satisfactory, but they can at least make it a little more understandable. <br /> <br /> Finally, only the remarkable stage piece is inspired by and drawn by the book author Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyrics Michael Korie, raising the class of the original GREECE GARDENS over a single (generous) star.
