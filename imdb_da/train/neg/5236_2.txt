My friends and I watched this movie in a week ago, and I feel absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who want to read this) that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies I ever have seen, but actually has the honor of being number one. I've seen a lot of movies, but no one beats this being stupid. you could say I was suffering from seeing it ... my only excuse is that we waited for a few hours and could not go anywhere without freezing our buttocks. I do not recommend this to anyone. At first we thought we saw some really bad porn movies, but figured out after 10 minutes, that's not the case. It's not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not action, it's not horror, it's just awful!
