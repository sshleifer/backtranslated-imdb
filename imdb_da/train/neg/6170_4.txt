This movie starts very very slowly, but when the action finally starts, it has to follow a little. I couldn't understand why some of the events took place and many events occurred before they were explained, making them confusing. The only thing it really has for it is the massive amount of blood / gore it has, although most times lack special effects. Blood resembles red Kool-Aid. Skin tearing sounds like someone is stepping on a pile of sticks. Again, history has a kind of amateur feeling for what the author did not take long to do perfectly. I want it to be a much better movie if the effects were made better and more time was taken on the script. I honestly wish I hadn't seen it, not because of gore, but because I feel I wasted 90 minutes in my life. If you like extremely gory movies, this is for you, if not, staying away.
