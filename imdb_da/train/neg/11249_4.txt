Visually amazing? Definitely. I've seen few movies look good for a while. Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow use striking movies, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically well-known but something completely fresh. The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s. The film tells of the recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies that steal generators and the like for an unexplained reason. Also mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, it does not take a leap of faith to know that it is Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter boyfriend always warm for a lead, and in his wings his credible, thoroughly competent sidekick. What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics lacks in narration and characterization. The reason for this movie is ridiculous. That said, the movie goes to a series-like sense of movie series of yesteryear. They had quite far out stories and bad plays - but none of them and I mean none of them had the budget and the big names this movie had. Two academically award-winning performers and Jude Law could keep a movie floating, one would think, but Sky Captain is sinking weakly. In spite of his amazing dark appearance, I thought I would like the movie to end and I could move on with my life. I had little interest in a story that created little interest. I didn't care about any of the glib portraits. Paltrow was just awful. Jolie was a joke with a role with almost no substance. The law cannot bear the one-line tradition rightly on his limited shoulders. I mean, let's see, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it kept so much promise yet, delivered so little. I'm bored ten minutes into the movie - waiting for something to hang my interest - and it never came.
