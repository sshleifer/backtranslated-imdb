I can count (on the one hand) the number of good movies with Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them. <br/> <br /> Interminable chase scenes, dim-witted dialogue and terrible continuity made this movie a prime choice to get the broadcast on MST3K. <br /> <br /> And that's the only way I could look at this ...
