Half Past Dead, lead role Steven Seagal starring was a big B hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie with no loser, but with no ability to win anything. It is less entertaining than the first: in all aspects. But it's even worth a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; If you also like to see previous WWE stars on the screen or even if you love to see successors, even if they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he's not made for the job. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing fantastic, nothing far from okay. <br /> <br /> Technical details, yes, a production from Sony can't be great. Cinematography was a disaster, but the overall direction was acceptable. Either way, just watch it if you want. If you see, you won't lose anything. But if you don't, you won't lose either.
