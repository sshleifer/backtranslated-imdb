A wealthy Harvard guy falls for a poor Radcliffe chicken much to his severe father (Ray Milland's) grief. <br /> <br /> Syrupy, sugary and most of all a juicy story of a 'class' battle when rich kid Ryan O'Neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobber parents to ridicule. Ali MacGraw is the social loss of the dirty mouth, while John Marley plays his secret Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his scary portrayal as Harvard's master yuppie. <br /> <br /> Followed 8 (!) Years later by 'Oliver's Story'.
