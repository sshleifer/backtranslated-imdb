Anna lives with her family in a new residential area just outside the city. She has been with her husband Sebastiaan for years, and they do not speak much longer. During work abroad, a female colleague commits suicide. Anna is deeply impressed with her death, even though she hardly knew her. No one seems to know why she took her own life. For the first time, Anna understands that one can be unknown among your most dear ones. Anna does not mention the incident home and begins to observe her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly begins to look at her own life. And she wondered how she was so staggered from the people closest to her. <br /> <br /> (This is my translation of DVD cover text synopsis.
