A young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues his late father's scientific research into joint dyeing with flying colors, but his interferent dominates mother and her doctor's lover will sell the serum. When he finds out, there is an accident where Harry loses an arm. Then he tries out in the serum and what is possibly a genetically deformed arm that has its own. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen this oh so many times before, but what elevates this very campy and rather rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, it's not a bad flick of the Fangoria movie; just there is better out there that is the same in the vein. "Served Ties" simply lacks its own distinctive style. Oddball nature and unpleasant splatter looked like "Re-animator" and even a touch of slapstick sticks out like something from "Evil Dead 2". The cartoon is really out with the black humor, but it can be melodramatic and a little dry in the fun factor. Surprises rise, especially the girl's final outcome. It is well accepted as I thought it might have run out with something more accessible. For a low budget production, the FX makeup can look rigid and very gloomy, but there are some grotesque moments that make you smile than actually crush. Even a brush of sexual excitement streamlines history thanks to Elke Sommer's strict juicy performance as the mother. Oliver Reed is completely humorous dead in a bad feeling, and he pulls it out very well. They were both extremely distracting as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is lovely in an irregular performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano is rapidly changing the film and orchestrating some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboosling horror. Yes, it is juvenile and basically stupid, but you have to give it to some entertaining entertainment.
