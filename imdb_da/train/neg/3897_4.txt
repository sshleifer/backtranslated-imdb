Labored comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall examines eccentric family in Maryland who has never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts pressure on the not-so-disinterested taxman. Debbie certainly made his share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period - and this one is no better or worse than the rest. The picture begins sharply, but flags halfway, becoming hectic and unclear. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats the chain. Based on the short story "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a bad sound mix that makes all the actors sound like they are stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
