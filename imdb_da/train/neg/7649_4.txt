Joyce Reynolds seems to be a mighty adult for the role of Janie, a 16-year-old boy in small-town America who dies his lighthouse to a visiting soldier and wins on the cover of Life magazine (smooching on a rug party) all in the same week! Non-stop barrage of wisecracks, puts down, bull talk and unfunny business like Janie's little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (like the girl) constantly scuttling for sassy kid sis, Janie's mother involved with the Red Cross, and Janie's father trying to write an editorial account of the problems of today's teens (like parents, dotted, sexless Edward Arnold and Pert, chatty Ann Harding makes an unlikely couple, even for 1944, he is unable to help perceive a child much less travel two of them) . Nominated for an Oscar (!) For Owen Mark's editing, Warner Bros. followed. this in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have grown her colleagues on then - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 from ****
