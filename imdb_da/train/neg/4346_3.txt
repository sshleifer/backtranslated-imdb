Why oh, why do people take good material and feel the need to change how? After reading the book that this movie is supposedly based on a few years ago, I can say that there is little about the original book. I went into this movie with low expectations - I knew it would have a sharp telemovie feel to it - but neither did it succeed. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only thing it has with original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a completely different character that has the same name. They have just spit in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adds insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a decisive role in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that when this movie is made, no other movie addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I would really have seen. I felt the same way Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews of amazing non-fictional materials and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld, but instead made a ho-hum movie about a horrible but strangely pathetic time villain (although Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never see Carlito's actual original rise and fall. <br /> <br /> The three stars are because we only see it as a standalone flick, it's not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito, but he can be good at other roles) And the story is not that bad. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But they completely misunderstand the nature of the underworld at the time (I'm a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff) - something that the original movie and books got right (after being written by a lawyer and now judging Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The fact is, it's not an independent one - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
