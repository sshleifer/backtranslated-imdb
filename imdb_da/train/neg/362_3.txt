Not to be confused with the Madonna movie "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly, fighty, off-the-wall comedy about a man longing to start a magazine called "The Next Big Thing "goes through a number of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look like a masterpiece. Filled with miserable plays, bad sets and costuming, etc. "... Thing" has earned some horrible reviews and to date has only been nominated for a fringe price. Pass this on.
