First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing the job. What a waste of time we all come to Hackman to do some work for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on those sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel, and the story bow goes nowhere, and simply shows us that Hackman is under close surveillance and everything he says or does is known to the gentlemen. Again, another 20 minutes. So more wasted time showing reunification with his wife. All of this should have taken 10-15 minutes mostly as a setup for the real action, plot and plot phrases. When the real action starts, I was so sorry I just wanted the movie to be closed. Hackman is great as usual, and also the other actors, but it is a dud of the first size.
