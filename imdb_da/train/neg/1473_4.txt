A thematic cinematography since its inception is the genre that involves seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only in their arms, but also in gloomy conditions, which will typically only endanger the male victims, along with ignorant whether or not or not temptresses will be forced to take their medication, and here Susan Lucci acts as the siren, although her catchy chops from a primary soap opera pedigree are insufficient to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), who starts running, starts a love affair just for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a trifle to her, but a serious case of heart for Richard, obviously fascinated by her boyfriend, while exploiting her ardor by engaging him in a risky plot that will train for a murderous purpose scheme. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical assault by his husband, he desperately tries to rid herself of what he believes is a marital trap in order for him to believe in herself and believe that the only thing clear is Solving his situation will be found in a rudimentary essay by hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of hitman's attack on Collins, a few police detectives, conducted by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, are becoming increasingly curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while reality is beginning to regret Richard, who may have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are really cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each providing a reading that gives a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong twists in a movie suffering from a hackneyed scenario as well as unexpected direction and design elements. Released on a Fremantle DVD, this largely lustrous affair depicting a man under the magic of an enchantment benefits from visual and sound quality in top flight, and while no extra features exist, the above-average production quality enhances the possible efforts of the cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
