This one is like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It gives nothing in the death department. One-liners are bad and are something that should not be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes as a good child throughout the film. Lisa Wilcox is still the only one who makes this a worthwhile one. The signs are extremely underdeveloped. All in all, better than the sixth, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
