Only in a very rare occasion does an episode of the x files fail to generate excitement or the episode contains something that is just plain boring. A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths occurred. Mulder has stated a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is demanding revenge. Now for the bizarre bit. The little girl has no connection whatsoever and just seems to be a random person chosen as reincarnation.I think this was a bit lazily written by the authors and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-file history!
