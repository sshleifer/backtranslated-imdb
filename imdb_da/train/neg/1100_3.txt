Since most reviews of this movie have been screened since 10 years ago, I would like to add a recent movie footage of the B-17's bombing Germany, the film cutting is for Oskar Werner's Hauptmann (captain) Wust character and his aide running for coverage as they go to Hitler's Fuehrer Bunker when they are debriefed by bunker staff, the film is set to one of many conference scenes with Albin Skoda, giving a decent impression of Adolf Hitler, who rally his officer to "Ultimate Victory" while Werner's character is shown as slowly coming to realize bunker denizen is caught up in a fantasy world - some non-bunker events are depicted, most notable is the flood of the metro system to prevent a Russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak unit and his family's difficulties in survival - this film suffers from a number of detailed inaccuracies, that a German movie was only 10 years after WW2 must not have included the actor who shows Goebbels (Willy Krause) wear, is the same uniform as Hitler, including armor-Goebbels had a brown Nazi party uniform with swastika bracelets. The "SS" soldier's wear is German army camouflage, the well-documented scene in Hitler awarded the iron cross to Hitler's youth boy has been found inside the bunker (it was done outside on the farm) and finally Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian brown model 1922 - Most people agree that it was a Walther PPK-some piece's play also works quite incorrect with the drunk dance scene near the film's end, which is remarkable. This bit is shown as a cabaret ride, with a drunk wounded soldier (his arm in a rail) maniacally goose-steping to music, while a nurse does a combination striptease / belly dance, all about candles ... this is actually embarrassing to see - the most incredible bit is when Werner's Captain Wust gain is an audience alone with Skoda's Hitler, Hitler appears who fell on a wall bench, killed and frightening when Werner's characters start questioning him, Hitler begins to scream, which is brought into an SS guard killing Werner's character in the back with a shot - this produced scene is not based on any true historical account -Werner's character is then knocked out to die in an anteroom while Hitler prepares his own end, Hitler's farewell to his staff is shown, but the suicide is offscreen, the last second in the film shows Hitler's funeral dust smoke, which is slowly formed in a ghostly image of the face of the dead Oskar Werner / The Hauptmann Wust-This movie is more allegorical than historical, and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out recent films like the 1973 remake "Hitler: the last 10 days" or German movies "Downfall" (Der Untergang) if they wanting a more genuine account of this dramatic story, these two films based on first person eyewitness account with "Hitler: the last 10 days" legs compiled from Gerhard Boldt's autobiography as an employee of Fuehrer Bunker and "Downfall" performed by Hitler's secretary remembrance is the play "Der Letzte Akte" taken from American Nuremberg war crime judge Michael Musmanno's book "Ten Day to Death", which is more a collection of the event (many overtly imaginative) than the eyewitness story - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Rop's account, "Hitler's last day" was never made into a movie.
