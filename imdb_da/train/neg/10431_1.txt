I loved the first season. The quality went down a little in the second season, which, however, had a good center (Pegasus!). The third season was pretty novel and original and was OK. The fourth season began to go downhill quickly, because they never even started to give us any explanations as we were really starting to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon fractions? What was the meaning of Angel-Kara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth-1? What kind of past did the last five cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations? Anywhere, no answer anywhere. <br /> <br /> Then comes the end. Earth-2 (our earth) in the past. Well okay. But destroy the fleet?! Giving up technology and abandoning any city life and scattering a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet? It's not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the vision seems to be that mankind is forever trapped in a cycle that goes from natural romance to a decadent capitalist society that discovers destructive A.I. It destroys everything. It is without sight, without hope for a greater future for humanity, and it is antithetical to proper science fiction. And don't even get me started on the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment !! The whole "all this has happened before and will happen again" things should have been related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to the ground as we know it. Making the new show somehow consistent with the old one would have been the final blow of genius. Frenchman shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
