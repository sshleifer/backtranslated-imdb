Usually I went to watch the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the reason, but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg, and a movie must be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, I'm a movie freak, I've seen a lot of brutal movies in my life (Ichi killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal image I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply stupid, the steering is terrible, the action was mediocre, though the music was a cheap copy of so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There is not a single intelligent aspect throughout the movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to stand. (especially the scene where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby crying - horrible). I do not understand why the film was rated 16 in Germany, where usually the criterion is really hard (eg kill-bill (brutal, but it was fun by itself and had great prizes for Asian cinema and besides a grand directing) even a movie similar state of grace is judged 18). No one can call this a Horror movie, for it was actually more about showing off than frightening the public (Showing "Creep's" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) it is just a crazy instructor who lives out of his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence that has nothing to do with the plot or explain anything. The reason has gaps and mistakes, the dialogue is boring, honestly I cannot mention a single positive aspect of the film except for the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had anything to say, I would ban this movie from the theaters, I fully understand why none of the major manufacturing companies invested their money in this crap. I am looking forward to receiving feedback for my thread and I would be happy to discuss some topic. <br /> <br /> "Livin 'the dream baby, livin' the dream" David Aames
