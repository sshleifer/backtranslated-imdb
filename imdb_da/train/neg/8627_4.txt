Although this is generally a cheesy jungle adventure movie, it has some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful, and the adventure of adventure is good. You won't be bored to see it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as unclear as possible to play the eponymous lead, an unbashedly obscure jungle guide shanghai'd in escort rich boy Van Hoffman and his beautiful wife Shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal land. He never takes things seriously. Shower is there as a decoration, and Keith makes great use of her - she doesn't have to act much. She is not the only female to show her body, and the clear aspects of the movie make it halfway to a T / A image. There is nothing in this movie that will pay particular attention to it or away from it. Made to be shlock, it succeeds without much hassle. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
