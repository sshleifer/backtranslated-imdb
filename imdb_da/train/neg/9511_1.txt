I wanted to watch this movie ever since it was first announced on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see the last night at 7:40. I'm sorry the day that wasted my ticket on this garbage bin when I could see something better. The beginning was all a bunch of sex waste and clich√©s. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereotypes. The girlfriend was too stupid in her own age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept on have hardly any laughs. The bank robbery was quite boring with gags that have been used in other films. Their escape truck was an old blow up Chevy van that they claimed they had no breaks. Hi why didn't they get a nice girly vehicle for the robbery instead? It could have reinforced the audience's opinion about the movie. This film was very low low low low low budgeted as nothing in it was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of things in it that would drive Christian people nuts. Hi I even expected a car chase scene because all the bank robber movies have car chases but I but there was never any. So I rate this movie b, which stands for low budget and 1 out of 10 stars.
