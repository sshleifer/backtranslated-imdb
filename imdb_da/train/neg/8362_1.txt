This is a really bad movie. I have the racket my brain and I can't make a positive comment to do. The action is terrible. I have seen more credible notions of cable access. The reason is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president and a shark attacking something that is approaching it should have made cheesy fun at worst. Night of the Sharks isn't even that bad, it's good. The dialogue sounds and delivered as if it was written seconds before it was filmed. And on top of that, Sharks Night has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I am surprised that my ears didn't start to bleed from the techno-synthesized sounds of the 80's, which someone actually bothered to record. From everything I've read, the Italian film industry was dead in 1987. Night of the Sharks is like a last stitch in the coffin.
