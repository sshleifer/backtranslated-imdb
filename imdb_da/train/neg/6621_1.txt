Something somewhere must have been terribly wrong right at the time the director perceived this plot. The film, which was to remake one of the most beloved movies in the cinema, does not deliver in every aspect of film making. The best of the artists couldn't pick up the tuning either, it just shows that the film itself was a serious mistake. Editing is poor. Direction is crap. Action is out of this world (round)! The characters were going to see scary people laughing at their stupid dialogues and costumes. I didn't want to watch the movie, even though someone paid me the fare or even gave me a free burger with it.
