These were over 80 minutes of half-unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce such a thing. When I reached the 70th minute, I convinced myself that it was only a few minutes, and finally lasted, which I am a little proud of as I am considering watching this movie as a good test of human patience and stupidity. . Was it worth looking at it all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it, and if you are strong enough, you can even last ... Movie lacks coherence and signs do not seem to have any common sense at all. All the happenings in the movie, you can be sure you saw somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film roll.
