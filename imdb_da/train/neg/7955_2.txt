Carrie Fisher has said in more than one occasion that she made this movie for a period of her life when she had a big cocaine problem and she doesn't remember much about it. It would explain why she made this movie, but it doesn't explain why someone else in the cast or the crew did; I can't believe EVERYONE had a coke problem. This should be one of the absolutely worst movies ever made and that says something. The blame cannot be put on foot for "director" Tim Kincaid or "author" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this image is not written or directed by anyone. Apparently, it just came spontaneously together, as there are few signs of coherence, consistency, design, plot, intelligence, intelligence or anything else. What really is great is that there were some actual professionals involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and film photographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks has also been director, and not a bad one. Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is without understanding. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "instructor", has made quite a few sci-fi and horror movies with low rent, and after seeing most of them I can tell you that not one of them is good. However, this is by far the worst he has ever done, and that is an important achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely everything about this movie is in 12th rate - at best. The kinematics are horrible, the actor is ridiculous, "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is tired, derived and stupid. Don't waste your time, even look at the video box cover, let alone rent it. A complete, complete, annoying, total dud.
