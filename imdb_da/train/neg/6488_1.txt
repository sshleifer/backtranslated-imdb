Yes, the subject is a straight quote from the movie, and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so sad to die with this meaningless effort. All flashes etc. Does not make sense after the first 20 minutes is just bad film production + If you are epileptic, you would have died at least five times already. Of course, all David Lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be "the best movie ever made" because it doesn't make sense, and when it doesn't make sense, it should be art and art film is always good. Right? I say wrong. This kind of artificial craft is just a pathetic way of trying to show that you are a good film producer. Anthony Hopkins as an outstanding actor should just remain acting.
