the only scenes that made me laugh where christopher went into it (the crazy movie director) the rest of the movie was just boring. in the first hour or nothing happens right. Dozens that should be fun are not and zeta jones douglas is really overactive. Julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck (yes right!) Into the girl next door (where did I see this before?) Who gets the guy. for short.i really didn't care what would happen to the protagonists. If the cusack really fell into the building in a suicide attempt, the movie could have been more interresting to see.
