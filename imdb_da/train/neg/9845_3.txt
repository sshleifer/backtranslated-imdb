!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILS !!!!! <br /> <br /> When I saw the first half of GUILTY AS SIN, I couldn't believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterha clone from the mid 80s. It starts with a murder and it is back to the audience to muse "Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his lawyer?" But halfway through the film shows his early 90s credentials by becoming a "lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client "movies that end in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous end in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but the most unforgiving thing about it is that it was led by Sidney Lumet the same man who constantly brought us classic courtroom drama 12 ANGRY MEN
