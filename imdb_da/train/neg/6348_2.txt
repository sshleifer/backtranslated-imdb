Absolutely pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring and boring, and most of the molds would not even have made a loss in Allen's previous films. And to listen to the scary Will Ferrell, his Woody Allen imitation makes me ruin Ferrell's second-rate (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. It seems that the morose 70-year-old Allen should have been working since the clock was in a new century. I was really trying to get involved in the movie, but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldn't burn it slowly. So, instead of turning off and killing the afternoon sleeping in an upright position, I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where I had a really good book to reload (George Bailey's great tome 30 years ago "Germans." The day turned out good enough, no thanks Woody.
