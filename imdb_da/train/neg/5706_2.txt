This movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it just describes a large class of movies). It is the passionate, clever main character, his greasy but well-meaning sidekick with his poorly placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially hostile but soon softened beautiful lady who triggers the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the loved ones who were taken hostage, and of course, the careless evil opponent with his brutal minions. Everyone has already seen tons of these movies, and "National Treasure" is one of them, with only a little changed packaging. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed). I'm quite tired of feeling fooled for money after leaving the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you've ever felt that way too, keep my warning; Get miles away from this movie.
