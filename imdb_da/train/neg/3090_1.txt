I really have nothing new to add, but I just felt that I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Horrible. I run through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just saw Hobgoblins for about 10th time. It's really, really painful, but it was next on the list ... You can see there is a little core of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is "Hobgoblins" but it just couldn't get out. Everything about this movie is 4th movement. The story, the play, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", ... ahhhh forget it. I can see a piece of shit like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat") again and again with almost no bad effects (I really like it - it will be on TCM later this month - October 2009) but "Hobgoblins" is a whole 'nother ballgame. The worst part of it all is that it is now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and a little dry toast, my medicine, and yet replaced the new musical "New Wave" dance music, Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman in the living room, still through my head. This plague will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, don't you?
