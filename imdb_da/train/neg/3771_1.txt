This should be one of the worst movies in the 1990s. When my friends and I saw this movie (was the target group it was aimed at) we sat right and saw the first half of the hour with our jaws, which touched the floor, how bad it was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theater just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying in their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earned working to see this weak excuse for a movie. It must have looked like a good idea on paper, but on film it seems as if no one in the film has a clue what is going on. Crap acting, crap costumes. I can't cross how embarrassing this is to see. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
