warning: It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see, for example, 300). This confirms the above-mentioned lemma. The second scene is the centering center for all actions. Knowing the end makes the movie boring. Even more, other sites are revealed as history goes back and forth several times. And it became more frustrated. To compensate for the resulting lack of excitement, we learn more and more about how unbalanced the signs are. And oh yes, they have a lot to show. For example, Andy (P.Hoffman) is a drug addict, more? He cheats his wife, more? He's planning to steal his father more? His wife cheats with her brother, more? He doesn't regret his compassion for his mother's death, more? He's a serial killer anymore? etc etc. there is not enough room to write here ... I wonder how he could get a top job. And why his wife didn't leave him before. On the other hand, I greatly enjoy the performance of the actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH saves what's left from my $ 7 spent on this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it doesn't make sense, why should I take care of the despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic (least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> It is also very sentimental, for example, we must take care of the widow's father without knowing anything about the parents' lives before the crime.
