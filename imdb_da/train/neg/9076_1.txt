This was surely the stupid, cruel and most contradictory movie I've seen for some time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but as in the fascination of seeing a horrible car accident, I literally found it required in every way possible and slammed it to the end. I am by no means a prude protesting the comic depiction of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, There's something about Mary, both American Pie movies and even the infamous Freddy Got Fingered, I've found very comfortable on their own raw conditions. Mamie Van Dorsen's breast-worn mushrooms are the most frightening look of a naked geriatric since The Shining. Unfortunately, edited and shot, with incredibly annoying performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the movie ended without making me giggle once. The only useful purpose of the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a rough image. Oh, and it would also work fine as a grass fertilizer.
