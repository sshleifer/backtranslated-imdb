After reading several good reviews as well as hearing good things about it by mouth I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say I was a little disappointed. The story was hard to follow, because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and the past, which are very poorly executed. The characters are flat and uninteresting despite the actors' best efforts. Gender is and nudity is more explicit than they should be. I have never seen a movie where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that was not well explained at first. In my opinion, waste of time.
