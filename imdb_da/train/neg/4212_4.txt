The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and good humor, but when the movie changes to animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for that was at least for me was that the colors of much of the animation are too subdued, with too little contrast. It doesn't look good, at least on VHS. Sometimes it goes out and looks good, but not often Also the characters come and go too fast. For example, I would have liked to see more of "Moby Dick." However, when the film begins to draw, it retrieves with the entrance to the dragon and then the film ends strongly. <br /> <br /> All in all, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the big animated movies in the last few decades.
