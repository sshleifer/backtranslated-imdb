A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a Mountie man whom she loves ... but she also loves sex! During the film she gets more men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a (tame) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This movie put Russ Meyer on the card and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X-rated movie ever. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, it is not good. <br /> <br /> It's well-intentioned, and Erica Gavin is just amazing (what happened to her) and it was very colorful ... but according to today's standards it's extremely pretty. I'm surprised it now has an NC-17 rating - there's no hardcore sex and it only has topless women and no male nudity at all. It is also (unfortunately) quite boring and the addition of politics at the end was confusing (and rather stupid). It is worth catching, however, to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. So, I saw the carved version (which has an R rating), but I only heard a few seconds here and there is missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next movie "Beyond the Dolls Valley" is much better and dates very well. Capture it instead.
