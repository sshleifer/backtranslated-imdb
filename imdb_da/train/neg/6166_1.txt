I do not recommend this movie because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story should be on Algerian Berber territory. This was shot in the southern Tunisian desert (completely different culture, I know I am from both Tunisia and Algeria) the other shocking element was the character of his companion, speaking in the film with a very eloquent French academic academic academic academic French while the character she plays should be disturbed, never left her mountain kind of personality, as vivid as a Bedouin with that kind of education in that context is impossible. The most shameful scene and disrespectful, especially for the people of the region, is the "Femme repudiee" segment, which is a pure invention of the author / director, so it will never happen in an Algerian society ever !!!
