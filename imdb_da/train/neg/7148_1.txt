Before I watched this movie, I had very low expectations and went to see the cars. Eventually I myself regretted going for that reason. The reason is almost non-existent. Character development is non-existent. So many clich√©s and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released. If not for the exotics, I would not have judged this film myself. 1. An attempt at a coherent storyline is destroyed by this elite racing cult's pure absurdity and the ridiculous characters that make up its members. In fact, the movie's plot is so predictable and simply that an average child could predict the bulk of the story. Bad play, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Can't see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead, and it will saturate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
