Oh God. This movie could have been titled "When Writers Go On Strike!" What a stink. I had really great hopes for this, mostly after reading IMDb reviews, which makes me think about the whole IMDb class system, but it's a separate issue. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc. So I expected great things. To say I was disappointed is this year's understatement. There are so many things wrong with this movie, but I will limit myself to (a) the inconvenience of any family that behaves like these people do (a lot of aerobic training? Which planet is real life on?), That lumpy script a love murder?) and the fact that Dan's character is so unlikely, do you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? This movie was bursting with lumpy dialogue, creaking direction, ridiculous scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. We would have gone out after half an hour if we hadn't been with my parents who didn't go out and didn't like to waste money. Unlike the decision makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the money used to make this movie a bonfire - it would have been more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid this like the plague.
