This is a trial by both author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers, in an Arabic "Tarzan of the Apes". But this desert-watched movie shows none of the majesty present in Burrough's more successful jungle adventure. The focus is on the love between the beautiful English noble Jon Hall (as "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah), with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge. The opening states that the boy's mother lives, even though he is guilty of being carefree, but she never goes into the picture again. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated and it seems that it is missing recordings. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
