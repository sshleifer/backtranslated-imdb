I want to keep this card. This "adaptation" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site, and as a result, this movie has mysteriously found its way into the top 250. Jack Nicholson is ridiculous as Torrance, and that's Shelley Duvall. The story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: Stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and those people who says Kubrick was entitled to destroy King's story because King is ... not a good writer should stick to reviewing "masterpieces" as "eyes closed".
