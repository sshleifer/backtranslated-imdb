A half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into modern times, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-Playboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old coy flashing clich√©s. A woman chooses E.P. up on the beach and then continues to take over his life - and he does not seem to break! Dick Sargent is cruel in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Are trying hard as Elvis' two bosses (he's moon shadow you see). Some of the songs are quite good, especially "Almost in love", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated Elvis sex comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal attraction go to bed, there is actually a wooden board between them! Get real. ** from ****
