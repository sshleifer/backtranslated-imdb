I watched this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (like Jill), whom I had met briefly in LA at a modeling fair in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she was doing really well. Since she is such a beautiful and clear TV host and model, it was not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't really sure about the genre in this movie, and even though I liked the actors, I felt like it was for a college audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering horror, wasn't my favorite genre, but felt I had grown up to gags. It seemed to pull out in some places, let you guess some places about what the evil professor had, and which a lot of other movies had an unsatisfactory end. <br /> <br /> Having written a few scripts, I know a lot of this is difficult and can come down to personal opinions, how many movies you've seen and studied, and those you relate to at some point . <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it found interesting but not a satisfactory plot and joined me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned through the portal eventually and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfactory end and would earn a higher rating.
