I can't help it, but I seem to like movies that are supposed to be scary and just bad. I have personally noted it in my own top 10 worst movies just below creatures in the abyss! Watch this movie and laugh, just don't expect to see any academic awards to perform. More chance to understand the movie itself. Of course, I've seen much worse than this. Plus some maniac cruising around the desert wipe out the same people who just died, it's amazing that it should be original. I think it's one of those girlfriends or hate movies. you can do it yourself, it's terrible, but it pulls it out somehow, so i love it
