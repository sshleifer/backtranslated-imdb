Where does the money make movies like this? I think there is nothing to solve about this movie. None of the players are known, the writing is horrible, the photography is blurry, the story wanders between being a poor version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the actor is incredible. For anyone looking at all kinds of movies, good and bad, I must admit that this movie is about the worst I've seen since Attack of the Eye People back in the 50s. I don't like pushing the effort for people trying to create entertainment or, sky banning art, but this movie seems to appeal to no one. The story bends to a mysterious contamination of a person who is a poor version of the Celtic silver eagle, even though he acts more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones. The bad ones, along with the good ones in a city where they cannot escape. Take it from there as it is the best part. My advice is that unless you are in bad mythology, amateur writing, compelling action, and boring settings, you will be best served by leaving this on the shelf when renting videos.
