Insignificant and poorly brain (haha!) 80's horror as if thirteen in a dozen, but it can be considered entertaining if you see it in the right state of mind. The special effects are sticky, they scary and the manuscript seems to miss a few important paragraphs! The "brain" takes place in a typical still-American urban setting, where every youth works in the same dining room, and how cool a child in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a TV guru named Dr. Blake and his sweet heart brain begin their search for nationwide minds that govern. Under the "independent thinkers" mark, a huge cheesy brain sends waves through televisions and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now it's up to Meadowvale teen rebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his outrageous brain actually come from. There are clear references to outer life, but it's about it. Meh, who really needs a background in a movie like this? Unfortunately, there is not so much bloodshed, and the "evil" brain resembles an oversized sock. The only more or less interesting item for horror buffs takes a look at the cast and crew that made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and author Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" and "Pest". Both are much better movies and they wisely decided to step back to the film industry. The most famous face in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, which horror fans will worship forever for their role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak gives the key factor and she is of course a good talent ?? She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire, as this is her "masterpiece". In her debut she was credited as a "runaway model" and in "3 men and a baby", her character is called "one of Jack's girls". I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress?
