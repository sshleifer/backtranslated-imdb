Director Warren Beatty's intention to make Chester Gould's famous cartoon into a live-action cartoon (with Beatty himself cast as a square detective) had a sweet assault on innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and exciting that comes from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is ham, fun for a while, but ultimately tiring. Dick Tracy tries to bring down mobster Big Boy Caprice, aided by the love of Tess Trueheart, but intercepted by evil Breathless Mahoney. In the first half hour, the Oscar-winning artistic direction and the set design are wonderful to absorb, but as the plot crumbles predictably (without any real stitch in the writing), things begin to become royal. Al Pacino got a surprise Supporting Oscar nomination as bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (most often used as a decorative prop) gets to sing Stephen Sondheim's "Sooner or later", which cut the award for Best Original Song. Lots of heart thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to his vision - but the picture is too cool and calculated. It lacks heat. * 1/2 from ****
