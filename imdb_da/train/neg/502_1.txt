This movie is not only a very bad movie, with horrible actors - or supposed actors - a boring direction and a story that is not attractive. It also copies a scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso", directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years earlier), one of the most famous psychotrillers of Italian cinema and a cult film around the world. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director resumes the play of the black girl and the white girl, with a peek from a window in the bedroom. Of course, the scene in Rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the soft and charming of Martino's film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping tom player who plays the scene is simply the most appropriate way to prove that Rizzo's movies have no ideas, no originality, no taste and nothing at all. I think such things are an insult to the spectator.
