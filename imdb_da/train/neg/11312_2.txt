This film deserves the honor of its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls flat at all levels. The main weakness of the film is that it is unwilling to commit anything; it has camps, moralistic and epic elements without ever committing any of them. With regard to the story itself, Chretien de Troyes jumps into its tomb by this horrible adaptation that makes the lovable, unbearably innocent Percival a most ungallly and rude churl. Most likely, two types of people will see this, francophiles or arturiophiles. Speaking as one of the latter, I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
