Just looking at the sets, scanning and editing is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi is meant to take care of such things. Young brides fall dead at the altar after saying "I do". Their corps is stolen by a recognized gardener Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his freakish minions like his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) need injections of the young virgin glands to remain forever young ... forever beautiful. An avid local cub reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride had the same rare orchid for the altar; an orchid, where Dr. Lorenz would be most knowledgeable. A typical horror movie storm brews to visit Lorenz's property a bit creepy; especially with a dwarf and a slobbery hunchback on the spot. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
