Although the title may suggest examples of the 10 bids, it is a totally incorrect assumption. This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio's 14th-century "Decameron" story. <br /> <br /> Seen in a medieval Italian town's metropolitan population, it is a depiction of the reality of sex (and its consequences) within this world and time. A realistic view of Life in this world sometimes feels like a journey back in time. In view of the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the Irony of Life, at times. Or it can also be seen as a general satire in the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing special, but absolutely interesting, if you don't come up with expectations or assumptions.
