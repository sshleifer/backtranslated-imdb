Disappointing and annoying. The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature, but instead cleaves cliches in a heterogeneous way. Character is not explored in depth. These are pounk plunged into a plot, he obviously admits the need for a dramatic element, the mother's affair with his daughter's beloved. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he has some special situations and lines that are passive to let his angry daughter swallow her in the eye, Anne Reid gives an excellent performance. Scripture depicts Darren (Daniel Craig) as a Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde without hints on why, except he speaks cocaine before the big stage. <br /> <br /> A mature author could have done so much more with this subject.
