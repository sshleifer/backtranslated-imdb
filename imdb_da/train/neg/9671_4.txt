I might want to give 6 or 7 to this propaganda movie because it shows when and how a propaganda movie will be successful. If there are people who look at this piece and think that "yes, Jews must have done something to be treated like they were treated in World War II" then the movie is very well done to hide "why is and 'how is it, and mix correctly and false observations of how a people lives. What more can a propaganda film aim for? The part where an American film about the Rothschild family is included is reused here very sharply here. The question why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the tax system within that social law. <br /> <br /> In addition, the voltage level (or level of disgust) in the movie is slowly increasing, and the resolution-like end of the film suits the goal and the need to propaganda. The audience would leave in joy and gratitude to the times that come up ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film there is some kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The film is a kind of story today, so it is not necessary to fuss much about it actually. But in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful guardian can find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization, and integration problems. Overall, fine waste.
