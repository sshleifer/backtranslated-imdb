This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best movies. I really didn't like it and I was a little disappointed with that movie. For some reason it seemed like a movie they put together really fast. In some parts it became so boring that I had to speed it up. It didn't have any bloopers or some exciting parts like their other movies.
