Tom listens to one of the old radio broadcasts, some children from the 1950s to today would watch TV. But they didn't do television, as this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally moves in his boots and listens to a story of "phantom". In fact, he literally does everything that the narrator says, for example, "hair standing at the end, icy cold running down his back, her heart beating in her neck", etc. Meanwhile, Jerry sees Tom and laughs his beard at his scared - cat antics. <br /> <br /> We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon, where Jerry tortures Tom for no other reason than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for problems, it's one thing, but when he thinks of his own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case mentally) abused him, I find it hard to root for the little guy. <br /> These early T & M efforts were also one minute longer than anything that followed. Sometimes one minute makes a difference. It did here as this actually dragged on for a while. It could have been cut for five minutes without missing out on anything because the sketches went too long. It's normal for Tom and Jerry. Usually, they are much faster.
