My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings that exist in the movie. In fact, they are completely congruent with mine. What causes me is that in a movie it is silly and devoid of story about history, motive or dialogue. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that replacing lyrics that do not inspire anyone outside a dwindling audience is not the same as creating characters that are motivated to speak because of events created by the author or director. A silly story remains as such despite Neal Young's iconic heritage. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slides a tonic into an unsuspecting luck, which then finds its way on the dance floor to mouth the words to Young Song to the heroine who is unaware of what is occurred. Somehow, these two dream up a scheme where they want to go up the west coast in search of ????? Excuse Neal, stick to music and take films to Steven Stills.
