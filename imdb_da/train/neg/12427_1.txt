I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals who were not even the least bit funny (unlike the first 2 home movies alone that were very good). All boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas that are poorly copied by the first two, which just meant the people who wrote this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go over 20 bucks a week. This movie is absolutely miserable, it's not worth even renting. In fact, it doesn't look at tsv! Use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I just give this 1 star (out of 10). Just trust me when I say if you liked the first two and you are not a complete stupid, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
