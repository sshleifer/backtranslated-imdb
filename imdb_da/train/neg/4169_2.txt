I gave it a 2, just because Natassia Malthe (like the vampire Quintana) looks sooo sexy in this movie. There is certainly very little logic on this movie, but it is also most of the sci-fi vampire flicks. The movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are too many gips and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me fall ill. A good vampire movie should make more sense that you don't have to see much blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on a man he / she should do what a vampire will do. A few moans or screams are all that is needed to describe the scene (like the one at the end when Quintana tries to sexually awaken Rosa, all it needs is a few moans, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
