Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the city of Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night in a vicious full moon they drive and argue along a smooth and twisted mountain road. It doesn't look right, they are caring for another car and one or more of them are killed. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Precisely and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity. It is obviously influenced by "Carnival of Souls". The kinematics are decent, unfortunately there are zero suspense.4 out of 10 - just another instant forgettable teeny-bopper trash can.
