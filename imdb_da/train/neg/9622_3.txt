When I saw that this movie was shown on TV, I really looked forward to it. I grew up in the 1980s, and just like everyone else who has grown up during that time, has seen every 80's teen and summer camp movies out there. So I couldn't wait to watch this movie that completely spoofs the movie genre. What a disappointment !! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with almost no plot and no substance. And the filmmakers are trying to make dark humor completely unsuccessful - some of these so-called jokes did not come up with anything but just cruel and offensive. The only good thing about this movie was the wardrobe, music and plays. It was great to go on a nostalgia tour and see all the summer clothing styles from the 80s, and the same goes for the music. And the play was at all: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were present. Too bad they did not have better material to work with.
