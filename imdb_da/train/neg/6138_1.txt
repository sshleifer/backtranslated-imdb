This film was God-horrible, from performance to execution. The United States must create a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? This is their premise? The way to access, ends the US, is to win an obstacle course as a cross-country race, where the winner can ask something about the leader. And who better to win this race known as "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And don't forget that his father was an operative. Lucky for our hero there are gym equipment in lucky spots, just like the stone sausage horse in the middle of a square (without reason) in the middle of a crazy town. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the horrible HORIBBLE premise, the unpleasant fumbling of the romantic scenes, the obviously heavily depressed ninjas, whose only job seems to hold a flag to point to the racetrack and the worst climax ever . After winning the race, our hero makes the wish of the US government. And see and see, all work was worth it because the USA gets its Star Wars site! Huzzah! THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING?! Wow. But still, such a bad movie, it can be fun to watch. The cover alone showing ninjas with machine guns was enough to make me rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if I ever had to meet Kurt Thomas (the gymnast star) in real life, I'd probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in layout position.
