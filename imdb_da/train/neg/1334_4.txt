So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night after telling my mom how amazing it is ... Today's Lewis performance is actually remarkable and amazing, but anyone with equal minimal exposure to his second work should not expect something less. The fatal mistake in my eyes was that one was obsessed with proving this man's normality; The film chose to show him as a complete and complete jerk. On the one hand, I can see that this is a logical connection; Humanity always has the ability to be offensive, and disability should not hide it. I just wish that impartial spectators would not be so forgiving for deviant behavior and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable. They don't. To act out is normal, and so yes, disabled people act - but they do not because they are disabled. They do it because they are unreasonable. A physical weakening cannot afford you the right to publicly throw a hissy fit just because someone you love is settling down. <br /> <br /> There are some things it is unwise to do, whether you are disabled or capable of -bodied. Giving any tacit permission to start a football directly on the head with the sole purpose of mounting is one of them. (Certainly, I once saved the punishment from the school star player with my face, but I already belonged to it at that time. It was not for acceptance.) Participating in a bar brake is another. Revealing in the fact that your father only expands the company to you after you have proved yourself able to metaphorically jump through physical hoops, masochism takes one step too far. All these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way of demonstrating your bravery makes them no less stupid. <br /> <br /> So yes; Just because you have overcome obstacles to achieving good things does not make you any less for you. Being a good person prioritizes; Setting an inspiring example for disabled people should be shown far down the list.
