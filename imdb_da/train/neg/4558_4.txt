Honestly, I was disappointed with the "expiration date." Super clever title and interesting premise, but I don't think it delivered. What was it about? The protagonist's desire to reconnect with his native roots? Or more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But he was not created as one who has lived his life in fear - it seems his life was going fine, but since the doomsday is approaching, he should now start to worry. I didn't buy it. In the meantime, the supporting characters in the movie did not seem to have needs that interfered with an overall story. They were all about to do their thing, running parallel to the protagonist. Also, what was treated as a "curse" looked more like a case. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan to live in his apartment all day on his birthday? It's my criticism, but I loved the shots from Seattle, the film was beautiful, the play was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.
