The reason has already been described by other reviewers, so I just want to add that my reason for watching the movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all its incredible glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake must be one of the most beautiful, most beautiful examples of "posh totty" has been engaged in celluloid. Of his era and ilk, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actors with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me, have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie is very poor and is of its time, made very cheap. The song that covers the opening credits seems to continue forever and is appalling.
