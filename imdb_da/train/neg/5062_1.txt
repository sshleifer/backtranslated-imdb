This movie is bizarre. Better set, it's "freakin weird". I could give you a brief summary or some hoity toity analysis, but I would consider the waste of your time. Everything you need to know about this movie is two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, murder, murder, and a truly disturbing horror. At the end of the film, you feel like you have to take a bath to wash the felt of yourself, but not in a good way as after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It is as if you are a teenager (or that high school is that I am a teenager myself) and have just done something for you A: Wish you hadn't done, and B: Hope for the goodness of heaven and earth, that your parents never find out about. And no one likes it. My advice is that instead of destroying your mind and seeing a piece of evil movie, just waste your time on something a little less terrible and see "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather see "Kazaam" than "Murderous Maids "Read into what you want."
