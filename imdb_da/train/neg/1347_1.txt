Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon. I enjoyed both the first and second season in the series as well as the 1992 Christmas special "Inspector Gadget saves Christmas". Some gadget fans are quick to criticize the show's second season (1985), but they have to compare it with DiC's 2002 release of "Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge" and then they will find the second season to be absolute gold. <br /> <br /> Being a Gadget fan, I couldn't resist seeing the animated Inspector Gadget in something that wasn't Gadget Boy related. I bought the movie and I vowed to myself that I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I wasn't even prepared for what I was seeing. <br /> <br /> There was hardly a piece of the original show still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief list of some of the drawbacks to this movie: * The humor is non-existent from the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (originally an almost uniform part of the series like the Gadget) is missing from the action for fifteen to 20 minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * The original music of Saban & Levy is not there and the score that exists is underpair. (Understand that Saban has his own production company now, but at least "Inspector Gadget saves Christmas" had good music even without Saban.) * Don't expect to see any gadget gadgets that made the show so endearing as gadget -copter gadget-brella, gadget template, gadget-coat (which was actually used, but it wasn't even called the same), as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets. In this movie, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. That kind of thing irritates true fans of the show, and it's simply not necessary to change. <br /> <br /> * The original gadget gadget is now a fast-paced, seemingly "hip" convertible. All fans from the original series enjoyed the gadget mobile converted to the gadget and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Chief Quimby is now very short-haired and even a tool for the Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a little. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Are there any positives on this movie? OK, here goes ... Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In a scene, Chief Quimby speaks to a real crook from the comic series: The Great Wambini (classic "Gadget" villain of the second season, spoken by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Life is about making choices and living those choices. Most situations in life have a purpose, even though it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here: Keep the original formula! "If it's not broken, don't fix it." Genuine Gadget fans should remove this movie; You will surely be disappointed. Hopefully, DiC and Shout! The factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1", containing the first 22 episodes in the series. As a true Gadget fan, love 80's animation and many of DiC's programs, I encourage you to view the "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs that are excellent and safe to bring back good memories.
