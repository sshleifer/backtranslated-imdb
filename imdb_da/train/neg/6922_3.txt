One sheet and newspaper campaign suggested (as often as they did) a far more lurid and violent piece than what appeared on the drives. In fact, Claude Brook is an American rendering of Claudio Brook, who worked in film for years. This is quite difficult to find anymore; I would love to see it again to compare it with other international horrors of the day, but remember not particularly impressed way back when. Chances are that it was a chopped version that made it to American theaters and video. But oh, one sheet ... still a gem of my later horror collection.
