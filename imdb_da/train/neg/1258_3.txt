Warning: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot did it already - I'm resting my case. <br /> <br /> Film opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, showing that he is not as smart from the start. Marky Mark appears in shots without showing his distinctive underpants, and is then dismissed by an ordinary woman who prefers the toucans of chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> The perfunctory launch of the space station encircles Saturn without any apparent reason, interior of the ship's bustle with monkey genetic testing. Should we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to complete these experiments? The special effects team decides it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzee is lost in this staple of the 60s sci-fi cinema - Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the vastness of the space station by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while demonstrating his stupid stupidity by mounting a deep space rescue mission in a wormhole for a consumed test chimpanzee with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies. Before anyone can say, "Mindless Remake", Marky has soured the wormhole, crashed on a strange planet, removed the helmet without thinking about the mortality of the atmosphere, and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it was not for the backlight of plastr√¶erne. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It's the APES that does the hunt - or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw Planet of the Apes thirty-three years ago. When Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth were deployed crookedly helped immensely to establish * his * lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka annoying chimpanzee activist), with a loss without a Shakespeare script, did a great job of exaggerating both Marky and Clarke as the Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave dealer, assured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Although I have become expensive in hearing the sayings of this movie, a headline caption captured the essence of this Planet of the Apes 're-imagining': "Apes of Roth". While everyone else painted to look like extras from a million years BC or Greystoke, Tim Tim Roth, like Chimpanzee Thade, empties massive amounts of scenery and throws cake splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: It is sour when we first meet him ... and he is largely at the same level of acidity on the film's end. Nice twist. The original POTA (1968) constituted a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so dissatisfied with humanity that he left the ground for space without regret - but when that film evolved, Taylor was unknowingly locked in a fight to prove Worth of Humanity - As Their Only Master! The original film was ultimately a tale of humility, not salvation. When Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed. Is there anything that is cerebral or ironic for Marky Marks Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there is plenty to do. <br /> <br /> The slogan is crying: Take the planet back, but it's the APES planet. In this movie, humans and monkeys merged together, the people have degenerated into cavepeople, making the monkeys acquire speech and sensual body arms; the monkeys familiar to inherit the planet! Slowly, Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, will take it for granted that humans should be apex predators simply because they are there. "Take it back" is as ridiculous as monkeys landed here in 2001, complaining: "A planet where men evolved from APES ?? !!" and then causes problems with their overactive and hairy anuses. Heston was cast in 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! Throwing him like the dumb, doggy animal in a foreign community, was stupid an audience's expectations: How crazy must a world be where our husband Charlton can't blame respect? Marky Mark has at the moment only found that he has tight underpants. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly rejected by the apostate, he dominated the screen with his charisma and overwhelming overactivation. When Marky Mark tries to infuse fervor into the mongolite people, the unpopular guy in school is suddenly made in the classroom, telling you to stop drawing the penis on the board and throwing a shoe on him. Burton tries to raise Marky to the icon of mankind, but he comes as a chittering deviation. In the original film, the monkeys consider Taylor a deviant, but he was also to the audience and monkeys, a symbol of humanity. That irony again. <br /> <br /> There was a tendency for a man who elevated the stage to chew on a play technique - Heston - to play the father of this movie's first stage chaser, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's ape father triggers Charlton's own immortal lines, turning to HUMANS this time, "Damn them! Damn them all to hell!" <br /> <br /> The movie gets stupid and stupid towards the end, while Thaddeus gives Marky A scapegoat lesson rises a pod from high with Marky's chimpnaut in it. The monkeys demonstrate their hatred by bending in contrast to this incognitive being, while Marky proves his own hatred by mumbling: "Let's teach these monkeys about evolution." first, they are not monkeys, your monkey! Second, it was genetic manipulations and imbecile plot factories that brought the monkeys to this point, not evolution, and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the hidden laser gun is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Release of the twist end would only confuse viewers to believe that Estella Warren's half-naked role was actually integrated into the plot (still be my pants.). <br /> <br /> Whatever he was human its last submissive hope; in the end, cop monkeys Marky takes off to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, "It's a madman! A MADHOUSE !! ..."
