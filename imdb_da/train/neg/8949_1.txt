A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was excited to see how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not even come close to creating the mood or developing the characters that Orwell did so masterfully in his book. The director seems to think that everyone who sees the movie has read the book because he is not trying to demonstrate why the characters work and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is droll all the way through, and hardly anything that matters to the end. We never really find out what he does to live or why his love affair is forbidden or what the political climate is and why the protagonist wants rebellion. This book cannot be justified in film form without proper narration and explanation of the political system that suppresses the characters, and the fact that they are lacking is the greatest defect in this film. Besides that, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he was supposed to imagine. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the casting was well chosen. It's just too bad they were put in such a terribly customized movie with the wrong main actor. -Brian O.
