The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers plays out at a deadly slow pace after Johnny Rico leaves his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he wants and joined the mobile infantry. Foreigners in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs of the movie, instead of being squid monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths. Throughout this version, I was constantly amazed at how fruitful they have managed to do it all. The show is mostly worried about the relationships between the recruits and the painful, long-lasting glances that they give each other through their beaten-eyed auditors, with the 80s synth pop, which sometimes arrives * under the scant fight sequences that finally come up in the last few episodes. In terms of construction, it owes a debt to Top Gun, which shares a lot in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies).
