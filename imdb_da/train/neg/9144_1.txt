This movie is just really horrible, the eye-candy playing Ben can just do anything else wrong with this movie. The author / instructor / producer / lead actor etc had a good idea of ​​making a movie about the important issues of homosexual marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and almost any other issue that carries a gay man in those times. But trying to hit any issue in such a poorly-conceived movie makes little justice for any of these reasons. The scripture is bad, casting very common, but the dialogue and play is just sad. The gay-hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I've seen more passion in a corn flakes ad). The action is stiff and the dialogue forced (a scene where the brother feeds the detective, his lines were the highlight). <br /> <br /> I'm just happy to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other nonsense into the distribution, and if he thinks about it, I have some advice - just don't.
