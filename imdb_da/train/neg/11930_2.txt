Times are tough for Angel Town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons that are mostly unknown (mainly due to embarrassing writing), the gangs will have a street car, Martine joining the gangs, so they beat him up every day. However, due to the presence of an Olympic kickboxer (Olivier's world's latest actor "Gruner) by the name of Jacques, the hope is coming. Angel Town is seriously one of the most eerie movie films ever made (and I've seen my share). It seems to consist of the idea that all gang-infected neighborhoods are needed are French kickboxers who cannot act. Worst of all, there are so many awkward moments, it's just really fun. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: "You like the fighting?" (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in the head) I could kill him right? When I want him dead, he dies! The reason I don't want him dead is because I'm afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him, his son and wife will kill me, so he won't die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that it is wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is, of course, left out of the equation. Odd. <br /> <br /> Don't let me make that sound, though. as I hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible it's invaluable. The biggest grin comes at the end of the disastrous finale that sees the reasons go on with a gang member who (the movie's biggest logical hole) diminishes The use of pistols. Also a disabled Vietnam veterinarian helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while Gruner kicks the boxes the rest. fans of cinematic waste like this. <br /> <br /> The other one deals with this movie, for some reason Olivier Gruner never goes to college, although that's the main reason he is here in the states and not in France it gets on with his girlfriend (ie t cemetery in the movie's awkward beginnings) Angel Town is undoubtedly a mistake on every imaginable level, but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with crazy actions that don't make sense at any level, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, be sure to down tequila, like the ridiculous opening song details: "Not gracious in Angel Town" <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
