**** WARNING: Here are spoilers **** Why do I waste my fast-moving years of seeing waste like this? This movie is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, worse management, and then we haven't even come to the play yet. <br /> <br /> And of course you can predict the whole story from start to finish. Hero expert fights stupid, corrupt and incompetent minions. An avalanche goes out and bury all heroes who somehow manage to get out alive despite going through all sorts of cliffhanger hazards. Corrupt partner who caused it all gets fried alive along with his payoff money. The second avalanche heroically deflected by the renegade expert's adventurous experiment. Evil men eventually also turn out to have a heart. Troubled teenager falls into her crusty stapler's arms after being rescued by her. Etc, etc., Etc. Contract. On and on it goes. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little reason to warn of spoilers. You could probably work the whole plot out if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I wasn't too far away from the mark most of the time and anticipated what would happen next time. <br /> <br /> And then we haven't discussed the actual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commentator that although there are usually some redeeming features though a bad movie. You would be very pressured to find someone in this. I guess I gave it 2 out of 10 to some nice scenes, but that's it. It has been a while since a movie made me moan, but it certainly did.
