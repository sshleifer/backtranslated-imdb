I have seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "The Princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only stared to do her point, and then knocked the crap out of the opponents. Throughout the movie I was expecting to hear at least one acquaintance of what she liked, why she fought, who loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialogue. Don't look at it unless you want to get bored with your mind! It's so bad that I finally wondered how I can't scream in frustration 1 and a half hours. Around the rain. I give a 4/10.
