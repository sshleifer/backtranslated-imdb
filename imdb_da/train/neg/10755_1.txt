I can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad reproduction on Asimov than the artistic direction. Forget about the product placement disaster, the convincing performance of Will Smith and the gigantic plot gaps. This was not only ridiculous and painful to see. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV-inspired production values ​​and completely poor dialogue is probably aimed at very young children. What a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we had Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director). This really belongs in the bottom 100 list. Really horrible.
