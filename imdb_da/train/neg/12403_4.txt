ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (ninth) film in the series and it shows the direction it inevitably leads in. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) should be front and center. The rest of the casting should also just turn the clock and collect their checks. The series would rise to the apartment again and have its moments, but a deadly decline had set itself in. Lewis Stone throughout the series would also continue to portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic way. The rest of the throw would be professional even though it was getting smaller and smaller. On the other hand, Mickey Rooney would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. Andy's reaction to any situation was in a naive and incredible way. Even after returning as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "teapot on thunder" was the same, juvenile. In this film it is clearly illustrated. ANDY gets into several incredible situations which, with a simple explanation, would have been solved. This screenwriter was known as the 'idiot plot. A means of stretching a poorly written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooney's fault than the director and the authors. It was probably that George B. Seitz had directed one too many, and a firmer hand was needed to control Rooney's profits. To see our overview of the whole series, go to I AM YOUNG YOUNG ONCE (1937).
