I didn't even finish the movie because I was so sorry I thought I should pass and I saw it in the theaters and I and my friends just got tired so we got up and went to another movie if i ever have to sit for 2 min. of that movie again i think i shoot myself ... and i know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i was not surprised at all, i mean who didn't know she should do the right thing And let him be happy, I mean too real that you have to be a complete idiot, not knowing it. I know I didn't miss anything and if anyone asks me to watch the movie, I would say "over my dead body".
