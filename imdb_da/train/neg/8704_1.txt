Generally, I like dinosaur movies, but this one is pure crap. No script, no dialogs, no action. And the brave Colonel Rance tries to show that he is tough and then bowed his mouth like a twin brother, the stupid Proctor from the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (luckily not a waste of money when I watched the movie on TV). And I really can't understand 7 people who have graduated this sk * t 10. They must have been fooled. My advice if you see this title running away from it!
