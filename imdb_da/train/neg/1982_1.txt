Who? What? Where? When? Why? The action was horrible. Very robot, repeated. I've seen all the actors in this movie in better roles. The play was very elementary. At the end of this movie, the story was tied. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should also be tied up. So he never tries to write / correct another movie.
