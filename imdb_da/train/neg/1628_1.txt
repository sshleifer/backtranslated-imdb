Without a doubt one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really looks, really wants to be something important. The tragic truth is that it is so completely worthless at all levels that you cannot help laughing. In desperation for the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's film, it follows a day of the village couple in the desert ... they walk along a shady path, all like a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of tarradiddle dialogue provided here is incredibly poor ("I think life itself is made up of so many small spaces like this pomegranate .... but is it so beautiful?") According to what seems like An eternity of absolutely nothing happening (well ... OK ... we are treated to a bit of nudity and a lukewarm soft sex scene), which is finally a very anti-climatic confrontation with a couple of 'Nam veterinarians who make nature scene and performs some rather hard folk songs with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing quite eventful or interesting is happening in THIS WHOLE MOVIE. I thought the Larry Buchanan image "Strawberries need rain" was a weak example of a Bergman homage. "Golden apples" are just as bad, but the incessant random verbiage it presents makes it strangely horrible. 1.10
