I watched this movie on t.v. this afternoon, and I can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of waste. It is not fun at all and it takes your I.Q. down a few incisions. I know this movie is for kids, but that doesn't mean the authors should take their intelligence for granted. I testify that writers sat around a large wooden table and figured that a) the word "poop" corresponds to great grin. b) A four foot tall child can dunk on a ten foot high basketball net. c) Children should always fight kidnappers armed with weapons because the kidnappers will fall for something and d) 3 months karate training is all you need to beat the so-called "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the weakest suburbs "gang" in the world that could not scare anyone. Maybe the boys at MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh. Don't bother with this lama-ass excuse for a movie.
