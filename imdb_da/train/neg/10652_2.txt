You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now get ready for: Safety Pin Killer! That's right, in Killer Workout, a stupid slasher film, if I've ever seen one, the invisible killer sends his (or her) victims with an oversized news safety pin. It's a strange choice to be sure of the kind of things that deserve an explanation. Of course, the film never even tries to clarify where the killer has acquired such a thing. As the title suggests, an aerobic gym is under siege of a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the film gives so few clues about the killer's identity that almost everyone in the movie is a potential killer until they are killed. And since almost everyone, but the killer is dead, it's really just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strangely, while the entire name cast is killed, aerobics classes continue in earnest. In fact, nothing is capable of stopping the dance. While three men are being murdered in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; one character dies but is still seen prominently in the later training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he called the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Cop chases, explosive sunglasses, and hundreds of shots of women's exposed flesh are thrown at a good rate. Like the woman caught in the solarium, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of the Killer Workout. Finally, FINALLY flashed on the screen. Then what happened? You got it, shots from the women working out. Not even the end of the movie can stop them! <br /> <br />
