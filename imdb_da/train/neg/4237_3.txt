JUDAAI was a bold movie by Raj Kanwar at that time in 1997 when such a topic was cursed out of the box <br /> <br /> To give him his credit, it shows how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants <br /> <br /> The movie is, however, wrong melodramatic, in many places ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Why is Anil not buying a TV for his wife? when he earns so much Just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The button is handled well, but the handling is right out of the 80s The Johny-Paresh comedy that entertaines here and there stands out as a tender thumb as it does not fit in history <br /> <br /> Even there are several cringeworthy scenes <br /> <br /> Direction of Raj Kanwar is appropriate, but sometimes melodramatic music is okay, but most songs are forced out <br /> <br /> Anil makes his part good Sridevi is excellent in his part Urmila is decent Among the rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is fun, Paresh irritates Farida is decent
