Not that I was really surprised .... movies are never as good as the books they come from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they were pursued by the book's story too much, and the movie version did not show how terrible this house really was. Ending was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked awful because of some really bad cosmetic surgery. The play was, at best, unremarkable. Maybe if a theater version was made so they didn't have to stay that much in Lifetime's "made for TV movie" box, it would be a better flick. If you saw this movie, I strongly encourage you to track the book and read it. I doubt you will be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
