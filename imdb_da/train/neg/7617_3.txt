It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is definitely much worse. This movie is more fun and ridiculous than scary. I laughed most of the time when I saw it. Low-quality effects (when you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about and how low quality it is), bad actors (I hear them for the first time) and it looks like it's shot by an amateur video camera (so It looks more like a TV show than a movie. But at least I have had the patience to see it to the end. Like comedies? See it. Want to scare? Go see Ju-On: The Grudge or another good scary movie. <br /> <br /> If I talk about the Diablo game, I don't even know if I can classify it into a horror genre. Just some low budget crap. <br /> <br /> I rate it 3 out of 10
