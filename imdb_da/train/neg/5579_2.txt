The '60s are an occasional entertaining movie, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the movie. It is extremely uneven and contains many annoying elements. Take e.g. The shift between black and white and color. If it was done right, it could have been quite effective, but because it was done badly, it became a nuisance and only degraded the already bad experience; much of the movie had an odd feeling of it. The play was not extremely bad for a TV flick, but again it was quite embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent and end up being confusing. How has this family somehow been to many of the major events of the 1960s? The ending was much too juicy for my taste; Because it was Hollywoodized, everything just had to show up. I would advise you not to waste your time in the 60s and do anything else with your time. I'm glad I saw this in class and not my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. It's just my wandering thoughts about the girl. I hope you take my advice and stay away from this.
