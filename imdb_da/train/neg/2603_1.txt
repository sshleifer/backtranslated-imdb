I was interested in the subject and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dance at David Letterman's desk will find something extremely interesting in it. OK, she shows some breasts (or maybe a body double does). The reason is cut to pieces and the play is terrible. Neither lead has any material to work with, as the film's direction does not lead anywhere. Do not waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore movie and if you want to see someone else, skip this and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> The treatment of Doppelgangers legend is also completely criminal. See Charles Williams' novel "Descent Into Hell" for something worth considering instead. This is just an excuse to make a B movie to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at Blockbuster. What makes any of these people think that the action here was commendable? Give me a break.
