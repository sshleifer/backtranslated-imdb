It's incredible !! ..yes, someone before me wrote that it was time to waste space and watch this movie .. it is! Do not! I'm totally ranked! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I found fun playing the name's meaning in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to watch this movie (only at home of course) but now (just after) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actress games! Bad camera man! Bad scenario! .. Only a good think: the wonderful girl! Must be a manikin for sure! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 lines minimum?! I will not waste you, you are more time to read my opinion! I hope I was ready and under-able because English is not my native way of speaking. So have congratulations time and watch good movies, which I also try .. Fred!
