This movie seems to have been one of the training sessions for the Coppola family. It does not seem to know whether to be an "A" or a "B" Western. I think the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd will spin in his grave. <br /> <br /> All the "B" Western clich√©s are here. The two-gun pearly toothed completely in the white hat with the faithful steed ("C'mon Thunder"), the all-in-black beard villain, the heroine in distress, the ranch in trouble, the feuded sheriff, over the top villains etc . <br /> <br /> The few exceptions act is strictly from Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) Like the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As the villain looks like they would have been more at home in a 30's poverty order. The addition to the cast of veteran artists Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but they don't get enough to save it. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Should we believe the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> To be a great lover of westerns from all genres, I tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this movie. The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked so authentic. Except for the hero and the main chord, the other characters saw authenticity. <br /> <br /> If the producers were to revive the Hopalong Cassidy character, they might have thought of portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder, the sort of part Lee Marvin wanted. have excelled in. <br /> <br /> What more can I say though .. On the thunder, on big guy.
