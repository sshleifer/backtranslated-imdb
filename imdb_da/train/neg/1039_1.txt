This "movie" is one of the most terrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent collection. <br /> <br /> Shake your camera and get your actors suppose scowls don't count as "direction" that this movie needed in cuddling. Not that the writing was absolutely wonderful, but we were more left with a lot of artificial characters directed in the most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary style that appreciated by those who do not know how to lead). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it was cynically appealing to critics who do not know the first thing about film making (which is most of them). Just awful. It says a lot about Sundance and what has become of Victor Vargas being shown there.
