Things I learned from "The List". A decent movie photographer, a hot girl who can shop, and Malcom McDowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won't give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even when he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really ?!", Malcom McDowell is still trying. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs acting. <br /> <br /> Rent a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punished me by paying me $ 5.50 to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> When I make a movie, you don't need an end. Just let everything be inexplicable, unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep, BEFORE the end. Geni. <br /> <br /> Any random landlord can cure death by simply drawing a cross on a window. So few friends. <br /> <br /> Your girl can sing you back to life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs acting. <br /> <br /> If you bring this movie home, your roommate will hate you and have fun. <br /> <br /> Withdrawals will not be accepted.
