with all the European studies involved in this, you would think you would at least get some beautiful photograph; but the local color is kept to a minimum. Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There is a presumably romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or is she not a lesbian? - Does not serve any purpose at all. The police in the film is the most stupid to have graced a serial killer movie for a long time. There seems to be no message about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-30s. But since virtually everyone involved in it is dead, one does not see the point in it. <br /> <br /> Despite the bullfighting background of part of the story (which part? who can tell), you never get a good look at a bullfight. True Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose - with my blessings.
