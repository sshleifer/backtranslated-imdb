I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie when I know he admired Alan King and they would be fun together. I thought I'd seen all Billy's movies, but couldn't remember this, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and false feelings; You can smell every scene that comes (and goes!). Billy doesn't even come to be fun very often. He is too busy trying to cry false tears or show his fear of how much his father dropped him. Alan King himself is pretty sympathetic, just like the subplot of being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father, just like a big health crisis is taking place, etc. Or that two busy doctors can just close their practice to the moon around LA. And when the end comes, boy, it comes fast! Almost as if the authors realized that they had painted themselves into a corner, and the only way out was to make a scene of death. Mostly disappointing with a few glimpses of good humor.
