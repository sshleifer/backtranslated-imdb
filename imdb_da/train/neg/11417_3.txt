The youthful group in "St. Elmo's Fire", just graduating from college, hardly seems to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy, and stupid, but co-author and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation. With a now outdated cast of "up and comers", a background score that looks terribly similar to that of the "Terms of Endearment", and writes which gentlemen this innocence smugness over us, "Four" is a weak cream, one that becomes even more embarrassing as the years go on. * 1/2 from ****
