This was a watchable movie, but the plot was a bit weak and most jokes were from some of Rodney's earlier films. Having said that, it was worth looking at. I gave this a 5 out of 10. So basically it is one of the movies you don't go out of your way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
