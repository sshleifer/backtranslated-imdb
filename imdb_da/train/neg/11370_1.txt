This video provides a clear way to confuse and manipulate Americans on Islam. It is a pity that the people who did really believe American people are so stupid to believe it, perhaps as a US citizen, must protest against this kind of shed. If you want to know the truth about Islam, don't let anyone tell you ... THE CORAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it for yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... The video uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and linking things that are not even related. The music used on some points prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they don't really understand what's going on in there. They use images that are misplaced from their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment I would like to make a reflection ... Don't you think you can make the same exact movie with every religion in the world?
