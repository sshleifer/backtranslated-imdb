Sure I've seen bad movies in my life, but it was so bad I actually got angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director and asked him to refund my movie ticket, of course I did not receive a refund (or even a reply), but that is the point that matters. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop from being hit with a bat? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of breaking the pimple skull? The reason was thin, the movie was filled with clear clich√©s, and some parts of it just made no sense.
