Can we say the retard? This girl has no talent, what ever, nothing but complete waste. You people just mark 10 stars because you know that most people hate this pathetic woman, if it is such a "big" show, why was it then canceled after 6 scary episodes? Exactly. People who support her, you can seek help with NOT knowing what is fun. Her stand up comedy is just so stupid, seriously how do you find this trash fun? The show is trying to poke fun on stereotypes and other things that are not fun at all. Carlos Mencia is fun and for the stupid poster he actually has fans and his show is in the air, so I'm sorry you are a redneck who doesn't get his jokes. Give me my 20 minutes of my life back.
