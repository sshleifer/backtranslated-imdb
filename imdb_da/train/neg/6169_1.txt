As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and also do, I thought Nekeddo bur√¢ddo was fine. I examined the plot, read the reviews and even looked at some pictures to make sure it was a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So thrilled it was finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore I had expected, I was terribly disappointed. The reason was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much inexplicable, gore was hilarious rather than horrific, and what was with cartoon style sound effects? The play was probably the only thing that was mildly scary about it. I didn't understand the cactus idea and the way mothers man disappeared in the middle of the ocean after following a flashing light, they both left pretty inexplicable, or maybe I missed it, since my mind couldn't understand what I actually saw. I appreciate the way it should be; shocking and a few scenes (the weird cannibalism and own mother kissing?) were certain, I just think they went a little far and not even in a frightening way, they made it convincing, making it more credible to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. But it's a very entertaining movie and got a lot of laughs from me and a couple of friends, but unfortunately we didn't expect shudder comedy so it was worth looking at the entertainment value but don't expect a dark, deeply scary and scary movie; You just get disappointed. If this was a horror comedy / spoof I would probably rate it about a nine, the climax was the weird scene when the man climbed into his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but unfortunately, I did it one.
