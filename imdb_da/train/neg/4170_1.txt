This is just flat out uatches. If there is a story in here somewhere, it is so deeply buried under the fiercest figures and crushing camera work that it is inseparable. There are a group of vampire hunters going around doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside them. They pop their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine a blood and gore-covered alien sock popping screaming in horror when a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle product, that's what you come here. These people are loud, unpleasant, violent and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human people standing around in their CGI spaceship, so incredibly pompous that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right extremist in comparison. They are friends with some vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> This is the camera's work. Remember how all hated thousands of slices in one minute's scales from the recent Rolleball remake? The people who made this movie love that stuff. There are plenty of these here for three really crappy now-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. For comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
