When I was in school, I made a movie about a few roaming around the trees and talked, and I realized halfway through editing that this was not just a flawed aesthetic strategy, but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: sodden lyricism married to free metaphor - Stressed on social comments. But regardless of my own movie, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. For one thing, my 20 minutes ran out, not 85, and had more content on it: every pointless business is amazed here in four, five, six relentless minutes. The male leader is just incredible, a scary, high-haired creep given to the bursts of drama class improvement between philosophical insights deleted from the T-pub, and he gets plenty of room to make us hate him. Admittedly, if he was not such a ** hole, then the third act would make even less sense, as a few snarky dudes turn out to provide distant and thoroughly inappropriate echoes of "exploit values" but that does not make it easier to see it caged creep whimper "Please" in close up until the leaf runs out. I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN, who at least had the courage of his own misguided lechery: this movie crater is and will remain the worst Canadian movie all the time. At least I really hope so.
