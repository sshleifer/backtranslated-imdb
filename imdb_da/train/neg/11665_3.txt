I enjoyed the movie very, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and does not need them a bit and keeps my attention all the time with wisdom, history and scattered words of wisdom. But: [1] some of the foreign language accents made the dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] There is unnecessary excessive use of in-laws (especially the F-word, which is the only reason why this film was rated R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most emotions that keep you in the whole movie, except the final decision last minute, are uncomfortable because of the exaggerated prolonged dysfunctional reaction of some of the signs of loss living in the depth of bitterness and depression too long. [4] I would not recommend this movie because of a 5 second background story that did not add a bit to the sidebar it used or the movie - it only hit me the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterwards: the protagonist's mother to German ancestors, when looking at old WWII films, "secret roots to the Germans." There would be no "local color" or art if the Nazis won the war. I do not know of any Germans today except radical skinheads who believe that the world would be a better place if the Nazis won World War II.
