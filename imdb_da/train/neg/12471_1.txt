Living in the Middle East (in Israel) I was thrilled when I bought my ticket to Syriana. Having seen the trailer and been a thriller lover, I expected first and foremost to see a fast moving, breathable movie that wisely dips into global political decision making and the relationship between oil, power and corruption from a fresh angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, the interlaced editing made the understanding of logic very difficult, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you ultimately don't care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
