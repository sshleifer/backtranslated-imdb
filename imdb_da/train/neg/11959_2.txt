This movie is an angry rubbish of a movie set in Japan about a dysfunctional family ending up with a strange violent guest who just sits and sees the 4 members of the family at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit, I am surprised that it passed past the censors. On the whole, I think it will only appeal to those whom we should not be encouraging, rather than any suspected underlying message that comes to the rest of us to consider. A movie that panders to the worst element of society and is still completely gash ... A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition movies.
