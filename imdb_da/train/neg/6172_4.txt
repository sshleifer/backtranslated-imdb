I'll come to the movie in a moment. First, someone wanted "evidence" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he claimed the US "deserved" the 9-11 attacks. Well, here's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first crusade where Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned a synagogue with 300 Jews in it and continued killing any woman and child, there was a Muslim at the temple, I can tell you that history is still being told today in the Middle East, and we still pay for it. "<br /> <br /> We still pay for it? Whaddya means "we", paleface? Marines did not storm the temple. <br /> <br /> But in reality, Clinton never really came out and said good-bye that we "deserved" 9-11. As all his statements during his presidency, he insisted that we deserved 9-11. Just point to "fact" A, B, C and maybe D, and let the listener deduce that they should add up to conclusion X. When, in fact, most of Clinton's "Facts" added up to guacamole. <br /> But it is next to the point. We're here to talk movies, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can't escape his combed policy. It was only a matter of time before he focused on his paranoia and bitterness on Reagan Era, and what better time than when Stone's dreams were almost realized, on the day Reagan almost bought the farm. Unable to find any creepy plots or arrangements in Hinckley's attempted murder, he finds one with Al Haig. From a simple misconception of the chain of constitutional authority, Haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up his legal civil society to a ravaging megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands together as Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "Release the Hounds." Stone even recruits the tiniest person in Hollywood to play our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. A guy you love to hate on sight. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is ok. Average floating below average. Do not rent or buy. Try to catch it on cable. 4 out of 10
