There is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "movie". The original said it all and still stops. You can either read the book or do some research on the story and you will realize that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! After being in Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the sets and sites looked nothing like Kansas. The original is riveting, from the place that occupies the use of the actual participants, associated weapons and victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and filmography by Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in widescreen now. Let this turkey die a quick death.
