The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and Vienna's history. Take a well-known genius you haven't read, describe him as demented, including crazy doctors to cure him, a couple of pretty women, play his role of an actor with a huge mustache, get each character to speak with the strongest accent , show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention a few words used in the works of genius, exaggerate everything you can, especially music, and you're done. Target audience, stay away.
