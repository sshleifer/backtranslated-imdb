For me, the only reason to look at this remake was to see how bad and fun it could be. There was no doubt that it was fun and bad, because I had seen "Voyna in Mir" (1968). Shall we begin? Here we go ... Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bezukhov - a lean guy who lacks the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - a scarecrow, her image may cause insomnia; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Andrei Bolkonsky - an OK incarnation, like the lean fellow (see above) lacks the depth of a Russian soul and "struggles within"; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a rather unimpressive leader; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Prince Bolkonsky - a thin with an English face; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Count Bezukhov - a spineless freak show ... The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The actors' movements and the way they look and often speak terrible. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed in a one-day masquerade. Everything looks cheap and never comes close to our Russian men's and women's standards from the beginning of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> A good piece of entertainment to explore and make fun. We had a lot of giggles in our office when we remembered this modern product that had been shown the previous night on our TV. "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I guess many young people have never seen our movie ("Voyna in mir" 1968) or have a weird sense of "Tarantino-Spielberg" quality. Remember the scene when our house saves his friend, turns around, shoots, and the bridge goes boom? It looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> Creating a better version of the novel, which was screened correctly in our country, is neither meaning nor craft. But I would be happy to see a Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind". Hi, directors, wake up and get busy with it, instead of pampering our classics. <br /> <br /> Now back to common sense. Witnesses aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, but mortally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> To make foreign players trying to pass for Russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas), is a rude mistake and the filmmakers make this mistake over and over. Of course, it results in many laughs - especially Clemence Poesy is unpleasantly ridiculous, and her dancing and singing makes a Russian seer think: "This sucks so much that it's fun!"). To say something Ny, I'd like to mention the pace of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is very uneven. The story and the scenes are not naturally fluid - they stagger and emerge as in a modern video. Again, I must remember our "Voyna in mir", where the action is so natural and the story is so easy that you just sit back and enjoy "walking with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought maybe the Borodino battle would be great (somehow rehabilitating many disadvantages), but it has proved to be no struggle for the war scenes filmed in 1968. There After all, must be something good in this movie. And there is. The actors seem to be having a hard time making it work. They did not have a chance from the start, but they joined the "loser team". Plus 1 point for that recklessness. It makes a Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous, though they are meant to be dramatically strong and the actors do their best. It causes compassion and at times - fits laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still think about this series is the last part of it. It shows very vividly how everyone gets their "pay and tax". Besides judging by the movie trailers, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene that would surely kill the whole project. But fortunately, it has no nonsense. And that's a big plus. "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter", and today, here in present-day Russia, we do not have enough craft to film it properly. May I say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated immensely? Fortunately, a proper movie was screened during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - ours didn't even exist yet. There were so mitigating circumstances then. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the start, 1 point goes for recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the serial number. Thank you for your attention.
