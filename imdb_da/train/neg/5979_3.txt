Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, tied together without the usual advertising. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, struggle and a resolution where everyone is happy at last), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled in (over the final credits!) Without explanation, and everything is just a little too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why does it look on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both my sons enjoy Pokemon, and by showing interest in what they like, we are closer. Watching a movie in a theater is still different than watching it on the tube, and my sons enjoy the full movie experience. I gave the movie a 4, mostly from my children's point of view. <br /> <br />
