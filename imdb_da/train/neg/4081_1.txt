This is not the worst movie I've seen by Peter Greenaway, but it's close. This dishonesty goes to the worse Pillow Book. This director's movie of 3 I have seen that I find them all to be miserable. Like The Cook ..., regardless of the positive cinematic blossoms he shows, he becomes completely unfamiliar with the resistance of his material and overall presentation.
