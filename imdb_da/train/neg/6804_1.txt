This should be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked as exciting as Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow seemed much better. The reason has been prepared in the worst possible way. Just a couple of the horrible moments in the movie stand a flying companion in the open doorway of a flying 747 and try to close the door without being sucked out of the wind turbines at 250 miles an hour? Then the plane lands from a few miles out of 8000 feet, it's impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When she is on the runway (of course of course) she is instructed to pull on the folds HUH !! Getting on the flaps is there to ensure lift at low speeds, when you use the pressure on the runway inversely on the motors and provide maximum power! I can continue a little and pretty much wrong in the movie, but then my answer will be the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you will miss, take my word for it!
