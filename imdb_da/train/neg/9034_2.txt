The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo doesn't look so good, and I couldn't understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Meanwhile, Melvyn Douglas plays his normal unlikeable role, and Constance Bennett is just half-foolish, except for a couple of her screams that were fun. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the movie. I wish he had several lines as he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see that Ruth Gordon looks so young. I had only seen her in the crazy roles she played from the late 60's to the 80's and a knocked out old woman. Story-wise, the best part could have been the last few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things skiing, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. It was fantastic and humorous footage. All in all, I can see where this movie - Garbo's last - was not a box-office success. It just draws too much, continues to think about deceptions. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew it too and called it finish.
