I'm usually disappointed with networking movies. Even flix that attracts big name actors is usually ruined by television people. But this is the worst of the worst. The play is weak, and the actor, especially that of Tracey Pollan, is abominable. I have trudged off to watch my kids'high school plays and have been treated to better acting. Pollan seems like she is reading the script she is talking about. When she tries to express fear, anger or grief, it is extremely hollow. Due to the overall quality of production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to brave, just be prepared for a big disappointment. Scary things won't scare you, sad things won't make you sad, romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you'll probably be as worried as I was to see the ending arrive. "First to death" says a lot about this movie.
