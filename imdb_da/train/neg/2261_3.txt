RINGMASTER The stars Jerry Springer as TV talk show host called Jerry, but it is not JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, his guests are trailer trash, but not the trailer waste you get on JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they attack each other, but not as on ..... What is the point of making a movie about THE JERRY SPRINGER show and pretending it is NOT THE JERRY SPRING SHOW? And it's also a very boring movie
