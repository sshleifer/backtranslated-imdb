I will not go and give them my 10 bucks I went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can see it without me worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and she thinks the examples are ridiculous and would rather see the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy, in fact she thinks she looks more than a fool than daisy duke. These shorts she might as well have nothing on. And since when did American Pie have anything to do with the Dukes SHAMING on them to put the unpleasant line in there having sex with a car. That in itself should have got the film an R-rating. The only good thing that can come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals. Let's hope. So the people out there who watched the movie will see how it should have looked
