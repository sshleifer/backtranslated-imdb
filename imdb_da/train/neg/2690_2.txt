Hello, if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting, I would suggest it. If you happen to like cheap b-movies like me, it's good for a giggle! Apart from that, I would not suggest renting it, I will wait until it comes to the tube, say around 4 o'clock on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. The band that did this soundtrack, by the way, was coming for about two years after this flick, and no they sounded just as bad in accordance with the two small town reviews I could find on them. So again good if you find grass growing very fun, but good to see if you like to see how to NOT shoot a low budget movie.
