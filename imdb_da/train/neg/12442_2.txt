Invasion of the starships would surely be in "so bad it's good" category if the movie wasn't quite as sexist or racist. That this is so, simply makes it bad. It has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in the queen of outer space and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, Indians) that you would normally find in the thirties and eighties b-westerns. In terms of being non-fun, the same walk-through-the-cave gag is repeated well over ten times during this rather short movie. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but can't make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row or handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it). There are really no production values ​​to talk about, as "Star Creatures" makes Ro-Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from outer space, resembling the creations of Industrial Light and Magic. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely one of the forefront of what you should call early independent cinema ... not artistically enough for these theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of a all-night drive-in. <Br /> <br />
