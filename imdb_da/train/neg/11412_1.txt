This movie is so bad you can't imagine. The action is horrible, even worse than in third class soap operas. One is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interaction between the soldiers made no sense. The story could have been taken out of a bravo photo story, the dialogues were like wood like Treebeard, and the plot holes were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But today it doesn't have much to satisfy the audience. The actors were beautiful, for example the former Miss Switzerland and the protagonist was even hung (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of substance abuse. It's really cool man! Especially for 12 and 13 year old teenagers. But the media created an atmosphere in the witch, you were not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by saying implicitly that you are a geek if you do not go with the other "sheep" and say. exactly what it was when I was in the army / that's exactly what I have to do when I go to the army .. for any cheesy action that had drugs and cooling. And don't think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than clearing the sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I insulted a lieutenant). It is not necessary for each movie to be sophisticated. Sometimes you will only be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and I don't think it's a bad thing. But this kind of movie affects teens too much by showing them a cool lifestyle that is actually only stupid and makes them brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots. But as I now think that my opinion is not very popular, I will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at all costs and to save your wits! <br/> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (Sorry for my bad English)
