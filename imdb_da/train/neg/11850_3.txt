"Rival journalists Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) always try to spread stories about each other, the latter involving the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a cry was heard from his penthouse De Two journalists start as rivals, but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building are killed, "according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. <br /> <br /> This said being a follow-up to "The Thirteenth Guest" has little to do with the previous movie; It is not a successor as it has been derived. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a comfortable team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but the resulting film is very boring. Opening and closing are spectacular. An elongated wrapping of plot development points follows the climax. <br /> <br /> *** And Shriek in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark
