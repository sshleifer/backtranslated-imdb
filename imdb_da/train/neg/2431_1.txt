As a Turkish man now living in Sweden, I must confess that I often look at Scandinavian films. Most if I never understand. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "The Polish Wedding" with a Polish friend of mine, and we both said it was the worst movie we have ever seen. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, certainly not the female so-called star Helen Bergstrom. The reason is so stupid, nobody can believe it. I think it's all a mess from the start. many bad plays except Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
