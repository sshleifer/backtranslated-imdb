let me first say I watched this movie around midnight, and there is usually only dirt around this hour, but this movie broke the record. First and foremost, the protagonist is an old, not attractive, crazy guy, yet he comes to all the girls who come in their way, for example he goes to a store, speaks to a girl, and then you see them f * ck < br /> <br /> Second, there are lots of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all. I would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say: Quickly put your clothes on so we can f * ck! <br /> <br /> Thirdly, this film should show what a sexual addiction can do for a man or a family, this movie shows only softly-misrepresented eroticism that makes me wonder why these actors were agree to play in such waste
