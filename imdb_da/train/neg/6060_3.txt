There is this girl and she runs in the woods, but she ends up in this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion. Her father is in a van and he's all angry at it. The entire episode takes place inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice, but I wanted the choice to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby come out and it went into the corner. The part where they made the ultra sound was also quite fun. I was really sorry about the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter, and I couldn't really blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I was just laughing too hard and I would suggest seeing "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It wasn't the worst episode, but it wasn't that big.
