A low budget effort from Texas, which is at least well filmed, but it is a little comfort. Poor acting, or should I say, poorly-acting, a rather slender storyline that is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It seems that a bunch of young people put together a haunted house for Halloween, which happens every year, but this year things are different. Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying, but certainly fills the empty spots of which there is much. Putrid, puerile, absolutely avoided at all costs.
