Scary, but mostly in that sense, it will be over before I turn 70. I saw this as a sennat again in 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but only). Ray Milland is a little scary because he looks like he's been filled with a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks as though she has smoked all the beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is a turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there's nothing on it, but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I think it beats it. But God helps you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
