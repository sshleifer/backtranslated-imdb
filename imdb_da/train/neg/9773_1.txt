When this was released, I thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. But thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, linguistically than this .... but this is a beautifully brutal attack on one's ears. Hi, I can take a lot of it, but it was ridiculous. For the first six minutes alone, I heard half a dozen use of the Lord's name in vain plus an innumerable number of f-words. I wonder how many people went out of the theater, saw this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, some of the actors Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this movie Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the godly "Stonewall" Jackson in "God and Generals." The role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the movie and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: These are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some liberal critics - to describe this story, which is even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the film. But they were the only ones. Most critics were horrified as well as almost all the paying public. It's amazing that someone could praise price and waste like this. <br /> <br /> Trust me in this: There are no good, sympathetic characters throughout this movie. This is a badly ill movie: one of the worst of the "modern era". That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes over and over again - two hours of nothing but cruelty and just plain evil people. No thanks.
