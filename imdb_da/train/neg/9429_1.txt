I bought this movie for $ 5 on a used CD store and I'm sorry. I start by saying that I am a big fan of cheesy horror flicks. They provide a terribly tacky inexpensive entertainment. This movie was entertained in the first half hour because it was so bad that it could be fun in a MST3K style way quite easily. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> The play is the shameful part of the movie. While great plays cannot be expected, this was ridiculously bad and honestly all the entertainment that should have been. This is the plus side to the movie. Where the movie really falls into entertaining is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie gives too many "What% $ @ # is going on?" moments. There are many moments that, for example, the mother has strange suits for dinner, and then it has absolutely no consequence in the film. Along the midday line, someone responsible decided that it was fun watching people eat refined food for five minutes without dialogue every time a meal was served. During the meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts off to pure darkness outside. Then cut in again. And when you talk about the darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate where it doesn't seem to be night unless it's raining. And when you talk about darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it is so poorly informed that one cannot see what is going on half of the time, which is more frustration than anything. In one of the climatic scenes you can't even tell what to see, it's so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climate games, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say "Wow, it surprised me and that's good." I can say that the great revelation surprised me because I didn't see it come. The reason I didn't see it is because it made absolutely no sense. I will not spoil it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to different parts of the movie to find something that would have validated it at all, and all we found was several things to say it was not possible. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is actually better when you see it with the commentary tracks that make it fun. I love crap horror movies, but it was too much.
