PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a tough boy adopted by two parents, but he later comes into trouble. The junior can drive the grandfather's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can set a room on fire! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse fate. Rent the CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of **** I give it.
