Looking back at my college days at Ohio University, there will always be an event where I will remember with good memories. Channel 23 is OU's local access channel, and until the last few years they played pretty much what they were sent. This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy, microwave foamy Peeps, and then scanned images of them online, to a version of Macbeth with 8 degrees, which apparently had just learned to make squibs. <br /> <br /> But the King, in my opinion of Channel 23 lineup, was Midnight Skater. The first time I saw it was around 2pm. I should have studied. Or asleep. Or watch regular TV. But no, all it is for pussy. My roommate and I looked at Midnight Skater, and when it was complete, I didn't think any of us believed any of the movies had just happened. But probably it was a couple of nights later, and we had to understand that this movie actually existed. I could go on with how terrible it is, but it is the kind of terrible that makes life worth living. The reason is uneven, the play is terrible, all the soul is scary, but by God, if there are others who look at you, it is impossible not to feel good to see it. It's like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear what you are angry and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and want is to get someone else to experience the scary horror you've just expelled. <br /> <br /> Short story short, Midnight Skater, for all its epic bugs allow for some very late nights of fun. In addition, I desperately want the theme of midnight skates. Kudos to the one who wrote it and sang it. Sweet God I love that song.
