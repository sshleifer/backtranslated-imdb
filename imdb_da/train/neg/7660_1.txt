0 * s Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the video game director Uwe Boll, he tries to restore the game to an action-packed nail bite unfortunately, it doesn't succeed. Instead, he makes one of the worst movies ever made! Though he gets less celebrity like Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff lacks his film the essential prerequisites for a movie to be good as a storyline and a fundamental relativity of what's going on in the dark and light. The movie runs around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make monsters. Although they looked cool and feedings were good, a little lame. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating is 0/10.
