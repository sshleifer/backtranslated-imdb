This movie is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as fun as a bag hammer. Her bitchy abstinence from "Law and Order" carries over to a failed attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one to come out unharmed in this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to get out of this mess is Charlie and Denise's marriage. Hopefully this effort gives better results.
