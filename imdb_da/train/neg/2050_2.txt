Not that "a movie by Ulli Lommel" filled me with hope, but I have to admit that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink below my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to exploit digital video for their early projects, which is good and good to allow these kids to work without spending all their money on expensive movie stores. But many of these young filmmakers have also become accustomed to the idea of ​​filtering the finished film so that it looks qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video only works for "mockumentary" style because it never looks like anything other than video. Here are the primary problems with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daily soap opera about a killer. It doesn't want to see a movie. And it is even more unforgivable that Lommel is not a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that generating horror (or even excitement!) Is almost impossible. For God's love, this guy has been ruling since the 60s! He may be the only director who has not improved over a forty-year career in the company. And lucky us, he also wrote the script! So you can expect horrible actions that do not matter, unjustified behavior, and at least a truly pretentious ploth element that will leave you completely dissatisfied. Please miss this movie. You will thank me later.
