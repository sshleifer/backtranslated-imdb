And a self-absorbed one to start. At some point, medical assistant refers to himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the increasingly credible idea that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this movie doesn't spend enough time exploring the premise. Most of the screen time is divided between boyfriend-in-a-coma disputes and chasing the brain donor's killer. It tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but fails to deliver on any of the three. As a Frankenstein remake, this lacks everything that made the original good. No one calls the doctor insane or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim who opens an eye, and the amazing computer that makes it happen doesn't even appear. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it starts to go wrong, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any excitement over who the killer might be is broken by gradually showing him in the same room with all the possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing a person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as a setting is both overplayed and underutilized. The opening hammers home point that this happens in SF, a cable car plays an important role, the leaders live in a hilltop Victorian, Pier 39 looks and the final showdown happens at Golden Gate Park. More specifically along the ten meter cliff side at the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. Once the obvious scenery is rounded, no other attempt has been made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> The action is the only saving grace here. Keir Dullea shows a good selection and pulls out a couple of real emotional scenes. Suzanna Love depicts recovery from a coma. Tony Curtis only gets a handful of lines and twice as many evil guys are staring with most of Frankenscience explained away by his assistant. The little blonde boy also hits his tracks quite well. <br /> <br /> I also gave it an extra star for the scene where the man runs south from the bridge, it cuts for a U-turn in a non-related parking lot, and then he is immediately back on the bridge north. It takes quite a bit of something - courage, ignorance, deadlines - to try to slip one of the viewers during a single car fight.
