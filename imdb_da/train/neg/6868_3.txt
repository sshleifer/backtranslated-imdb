Okay, like an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I will be a bit biased against this movie. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's only purpose in making this movie was Orthodox bashing. With our wigs, modest clothes and separate seats, we are already a pretty easy target. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia to love him more than G-d or their parents. Then he consciously tolerates his father's orders that he does not swim because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out on her son's breeze. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe she never attended one before. Let's face it, although reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies today. 3. Was Mendel sleeping in his chosson classes? He had to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel should have been married for over a year, and he now saw that they were not meant for each other? A little clue - arranged marriage does not mean that the girl must take the first guy her parents put her on. Nor will she be cut off by society if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry industry so badly, she didn't have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came out as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she did not like the outcome. It's not up to one's environment it's pandering to stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.
