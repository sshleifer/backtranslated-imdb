It must first be stated that I have read the MANGA, and therefore my reasoning is based on the differences. <br /> <br /> This anime disappointed me greatly because it removed comedy and high quality for the action of manga and OVA. What left it was just a reminder of what it might have been. Many of the characters lacked the depth seen in manga. Alucard is not the sympathetic character who secretly wants to die. Walter's story lacks treason. And the Nazi villains plotting to swallow the world at war are completely absent. Instead, give the anime Gary Stu villain Incognito, who is defeated by what seems to be all odds. My primary complaint is not that anime differs from manga but that it does such a bad job.
