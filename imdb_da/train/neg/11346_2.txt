Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS PROPERTY) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin and when Air Force friends return to the states with a Cobra Curse on them, the action is just a waiting game. See Believe the Snake Woman and try to pretend the rest is not happening.
