This film is nothing more than a religious area that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age Occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of basic religious comparisons. Basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the signs appear both in the present and in the 1600s), of course, are reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Wildlife and plant life are all the same. (This is Pantheism). Redfield has tried to mix Eastern mystery with Western Christianty. His attempt at syncretism can fool or confuse those who are not truth seekers, but this film is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. When the ad in the old Berkeley Barb used to say $ 10.00, you will show how to start your own religion. As a famous prophet has said, "Use Force Luke".
