As a big fan of only the first 2 seasons of the BSG and the stand-alone feature BSG Razor, I hoped that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. Normally I have no problem with science fiction, which is mostly dialogue driven as opposed to a visual bonanza with special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas provided by good actors, you can make a deep movie with small CGI money spent. This prequel has none of the above requirements go to it. The virtual reality world created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rate to Limited. Not that teens don't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence and heavy dance music. Its part about the same teens with the intellectual depth and reason or political and religious passion for creating such futuristic software or becoming suicide bombers that confuse me. These children are certainly not from this planet. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being a bit interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz gave his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student's firmware upgrade was entertaining, if not entertaining. But this old concept was much better portrayed and much more credible in the brilliant, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off his only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, this movie was gentle & unoriginal & cheap looking, using recycled CGI from Caprica from BSG. I doubt that I see this room soap when it characterizes the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I suffer from a bad fight for insomnia, at which point this show will surely be a cure. zzzzzzzz
