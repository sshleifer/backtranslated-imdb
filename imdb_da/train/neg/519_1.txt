At least with teenage geek getting the girl movies, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40-year-old virgin, he is replaced by a 40-year-old guy who is popular with women, but somehow has been a virgin. But then you don't have to engage your brain with this movie or did I miss a bit that he was comatose for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of movies where 40 somethings work as teenagers and women for some reason, it seems a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent television comedies seems to think it has to rely on raw and superficial signs of grin. They made the brutal movies. They have made the charge work like all Americans have a mental age of 15 years. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This movie is crass and raw entertainment with nothing to recommend it.
