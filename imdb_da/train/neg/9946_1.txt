SPOILERS HERIN <br /> <br /> My high school did everything they could to try and motivate us for the exam. But the most memorable method they used to get us in the right state of mind was the guest's speaker, which was not the only Australian Kickboxing's favorite son, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this guy a microphone because he screamed half the time despite us saying he was not more than 3 or 4 meters away from him. Now his speech was full of the usual "if you are unable to prepare, then prepare to fail" things, but there were various instances where I was truly earned. The guy stood there in front of us to teach how he did everything for himself and no one else throughout his life. He was offered many offers in the past to give up kickboxing, but he never took notice of the prize of becoming Australia's biggest kickboxer. He said he was not a salesperson, he was happy and a pensioner, he was never involved in any activity other than Kickboxing ?? so he plucked his movie. Yeah, you've heard right, he PLUGGED his new movie. When he talked about it, he got a woman coming in and holding up a poster that advertised it, and then he showed this shitty 4-minute clip of this evil movie called "Trojan Warrior". (All this was before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last career match (for now)) Stan plays Ajax, a kickboxing ex-special forces agent drawn into the seedy underworld of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel), recently sold out (well, at least Stan did not fall too far away from ALT) to his feet, and as a result it is in danger from all walks of life. Ajax and Theo come in all sorts of ridiculous situations, from fighting in a Kebab store to being like playboys at a bondage party. It's all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible movie here, this man should never be handed a camera again. <br /> <br /> I admit I was actually pumped to see this. I love action movies, even if they are corny, and especially if it's in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to was a movie of acting terribly of the word "go" and continuing to do so by the words "for the love of God, let it stop!", Subplots were introduced and not even touched again after They were out in the open, characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason, and the most over-choreographed battle scenes that did not even remove the distant Stan's actual talent in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by almost all REMOTELY famous (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). The whole time you sit there and play the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background. Too much, the movie depends heavily on split-second appearances of former celebrities. Remember the plot holes I told you about? Ajax was at one time apparently unlocked, mistakenly accused of murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in special forces via a single sentence in the WHOLE film, and then let it go to buggery. This is followed by another SINGLE phrase that persuades Ajax to help the same people who mistakenly locked him up. Then you get this, in the end it is obvious to Ajax that his wife is not actually dead, but was sold for prostitution. We see her No. Does Ajax go out to find her as soon as he hears this? No, it's a marriage! <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this annoying puerile crap, some websites describe this movie as "a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie ??". Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan movie?! Chan shows more dexterity by taking a dump than Stan did, yes, something! And Guy Ritchie is the Messiah's crime film, and you compare him to Salik Silverstein! This movie is more like a mix between "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where do you get the whole "Trojan Warrior" title from? Ajax tough fighting skills like an ancient Greek warrior? No. The gangster's association to find Theo, as the Trojan empire? No. That is because ?? wait for it ?? Theo carries a condom around with him. Yes, that's right because THEO is always prepared with a Trojan badge in his pocket, he's a Trojan warrior! <br /> <br /> I had the displeasure to see "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as being "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clips of "Chop Chop", a rap song by Mark "Chopper" Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ALL can rap. The funny thing was Chopper ripped just for 30 seconds and then threw it to these two albino teens from Doncaster, using such words as "dis" and "dope" etc. In their Australian accents. Face the people rap was developed in the states, leaving it there! The clip looked like something a channel 31 camera man on ecstasy put together. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the actual movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: It wasn't that bad, as only 6 or 7 different matches were shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall over 15 times in the 3-minute montage). <Br /> <br /> I don't want to say that this movie contributes to the reason why this country comes to hell when it comes to movies, but ... Oh wait, I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of the "Trojan Warrior", tape them together and use it for a paper weight, because this movie is just so wrong.
