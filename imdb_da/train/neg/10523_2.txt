In the first forty minutes, Empire is really shaping up: it seems to be a strong, safe and relatively unknown gangster girl. At that time I didn't know why, I thought it was good - but now I do. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest issues with this movie is that it is clean and completely uncomfortable. I don't mind movies with psychoses and things, to prove a point - take Jackie Brown for example - but they are all so terribly low in this, but of course it is thrown into entertainment. You literally feel a knot in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He's alley, arrogant, but ironically - not so bad. He does not seem to be close enough to be a drug-fighting woman killer. The fact is that at the end of the day, this film is quite pretentious. Not slick, not clever, just boring and meaningless - this colossal mess must be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (1 out of 5)
