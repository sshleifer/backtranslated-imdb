This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify inconsistent ideas covered by such statements as "we all create our own reality". <br /> <br /> Sorry, the reality of the people is what is true for all of us, not just the credible one. <br /> <br /> The idea that "everything is possible" does not hold water on closer examination: if anything is possible, there are contradictory things and nothing is possible. This leads to postmodern nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to deny established truths, so all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are alike. To quote the sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, who says it so well, "Reality is what when you stop believing it doesn't go away."
