Don't even let me ask why I saw this! The only excuse I can make, I was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It is too terrible for words, the movie there is, not bronchitis. The actor is regrettable, Richard Grieco pushes it up as a trigger-happy, gun-winding serial killer with a penchant for knocking off the police. Nick Mancuso phones in a show as a policeman on his track and Nancy Allen manages to put the only sympathetic role in the whole movie. The scripture is gloomy, whipped with clich√©s, "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco jumps to each of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
