Really, they spelled it BRAIN in the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they didn't have the budget for a spell check. All production money went to good old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One is a Darin Convertible. A nice yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> The scenarios in the film studio show that there was some money spent on costumes and putting decorations. Old cameras, an exterior Ciro, street signs and all that was needed to make a visually appealing image were there. Badly written and directed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it runs for 104 minutes, approx. It was more than 85 minutes. It came to an end without reaching a conclusion. There was a collision, but no conclusion. The movie just hit the credits. 99 cents for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I could have bought 3 cats of cat food and looked at my cat's face as he felt more excitement. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds in the Ciri scene after Darren McGavin received a phone call, it might seem. .. this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting movie. Then it sat straight. <br /> <br /> The young Latin actor who played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have had a much greater role in everything that went on here. This roll could have made a good movie. I think if they cut Brian's role and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the manuscript and hold Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound to their band, they got something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
