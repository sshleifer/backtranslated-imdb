Lastly, I caught up with "Starlight" last night on TV, and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to start - the extraordinary hokey-special effects (see the laser beams out of Willie's eyes!), The terrible action, the unconscious dialogue, the inconsistent use of stock footage or the air of serious pretentiousness that infuse the entire production. This is truly a unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. I designate Jonathon Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood!
