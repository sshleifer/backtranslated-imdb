I have been willing to put a lot of late-spring / summer action fluff movies into action, but in general, most of them have a reasonable payout (ie cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). However, this film had none of this. All we got was the cheap excitement for several minutes by Eva Longoria's split (a matter of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, excitement, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get into details, but frankly I already have - perhaps willingly forgotten most of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the time I was in the theater, I kicked myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season DVD. Save your money on this, guys. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's division.
