This Worldwide was the inexpensive men's version of what the NWA during Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made back in the 1980s at the localized "Big 3" stations during Saturday morning / afternoon chatter. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's failed version of the NWA, he made it to World Championship Wrestling and continued to drop all NWA references together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were relayed with the WCW logo and moved away from Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida and became no more than recap shows for WCW's Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the last WCW program under Turner to fly the weekend in the WCW buyout from Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive, along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library is generally located in the vaults of WWE Headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
