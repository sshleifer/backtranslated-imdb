Give it what crappy movie it was here! I can't understand what people find so scary about "The Grudge". The director plays a trick (I have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a result, I shot a couple of times in the film's first quarter, but when I knew the drill, I almost fell asleep when The Grudge became more and more predictable in the minute. In the end, I can say that there is much better movie in the genre to begin with, the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was so scary and buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
