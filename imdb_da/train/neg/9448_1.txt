No redeeming features this movie is bad. Its jokes are not fun. The children's humor is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a sticky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through with my children just made me uncomfortable with what might come next. I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. Although my child, for whom the DVD was purchased, enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters gave much interest in seeing it again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King etc, as all get frequent requests for replays.
