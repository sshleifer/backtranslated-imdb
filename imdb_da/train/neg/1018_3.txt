There is an excellent reason why Edison went straight to the video: It would have landed in theaters with a crumbling spout. The movie lasted too long and was dangerously boring. Just a tick over lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who of course had an extra two weeks before their next movie), they are evil as ridiculous and act as astounding as Justin Timberlake's play. I hate to beat the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. The movie is not that bad ... just for the most part. I like that LL Cool J got what seems to be a shot at being a leading man. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always fun (you can see him gulp several times as he thaws the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to raise this flick to three stars (out of ten ... he's not that good). /> <br /> When all is said and done, the ultimate mistake with this movie is that it is an everyday and tiring piece of pseudo-action poppycock that doesn't keep anyone awake. It also fails to get someone to give a good boy about any of the characters. All in all, it's just boring. That said, rent this when you suffer from insomnia.
