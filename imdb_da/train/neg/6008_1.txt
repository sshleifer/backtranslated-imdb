If you made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book, do not give up on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May this year, and already I'm almost done with book 10. I dare say the movie is a piece of garbage that doesn't make the series even a sniff of justice. While the "Left Behind: The Movie" follows only the story of the "left behind" (book), the characters are not even close to precise. <br /> <br /> A few examples: Rayford never works on his feelings for Hattie (he is aware when he is informed about vanishing); Buck Williams is a blonde hair, magazine writer, not a television reporter; Chloe is in Stanford and many of the book details Rayford wonder if she 'survived'; Buck and Chloe will not meet much later, at a meeting in New York, created by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never 'in the book', rather only in Rayford's retreated thoughts; the roads are then jam packed with wrecks after the rapture that Rayford and Hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs ... etc etc etc. <br /> <br /> And it's just from the first movie; they are releasing the third. Please, even if you did not like the movies, give the books a chance.
