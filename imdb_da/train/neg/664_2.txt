I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or stealing the modern jargon "retelling", but this movie really penetrated me. The original Prom Night, but not in my humble estimate a masterpiece, still understood what it was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror movie. Suspension is essential to maintain public interest. Sorry people, but a white crack film wasn't it! The scares were cheap and persecuted terribly. (A good example of scare that has been done to cleave excess now is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed shortly thereafter, but a now unexpected look of the villain of the movie) This movie could not successfully pull it away, so how could I expect it to meet any of the other horror movie conventions. There must be a sympathetic hero or heroine. This movie doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the main detective. His calm behavior, but the key-shaped approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Sans common sense approach to events that occur. (If you run from an Ax-wielding psycho, turn and jump in the opposite direction. Don't jog while looking back for three seconds, initiate the killer's progress, just to cross each branch and lifeless object in your path .) If your friend disappears, you are not looking for them alone. And if you suspect an unfortunate game, you tell someone not to examine yourself. These cliches are tired and well overlaid. In the horror genre in general and especially in this movie.
