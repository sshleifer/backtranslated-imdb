What did I just look at? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life and watching one of the stupid movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer is actually quite scary to see that there are many people who are afraid of clowns .... but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhym reciting killer clown makes a shame on the genre. I'm still wondering how the Mark Mark couldn't run away from the Clown ... he's 300 pounds, he'll have to get tired in the end. The whole end made me stand up and literally say aloud "What did I look like?" Apparently, Brandon Denise's cousin .... and they had got it close to the middle of the movie because he had sex with his cousin ..... yes that's something people will see, so * shudder *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown sticks a woman and she says "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he did? The last thing that was stupidly fun was a second, the protagonist hit the hitch hiker and called her and then 5 minutes later to say that violence does not help .... did the author of the script line the wrong guy? However, none of this film makes sense. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less a stupid low-budget porn that I was eager to buy (all 3.99) and got no entertainment out of it except the sex scenes. I am surprised that the fat clown did not participate in the orgie, would have looked straight in. I hoped the movie would have some entertainment value that other B movies might have, but I was wrong. This is a moronic piece of waste that is not even worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
