My Goodness! While I still maintain that Manos: The Fed's hands are the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came terribly dense. This ... this ... thing offends the audience at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least movies like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this was a struggle to get through. I was literally writhing on the couch in anxiety. This thing managed to scare me - alone! Although you are a deadly MST3K fan and have made it your mission to see every experiment, think twice about seeing it. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
