A stinko of a movie with a shopworn plot and, to be kind, appear less than Oscar caliber. But for me, the only worst mistake was the total misrepresentation of a jet and especially a 747. Some of the big blunders: <br /> <br /> 1. No aircraft engineer (or even an aircraft engineer station) 2. Misidentification of F -16 interceptors as F-15 (no resmblance). 3. Loading passengers in a "trunk" allegedly accessible from the cabin - Although such a room existed and placed so much weight that the farthest would make the aircraft fleeting. 4. Auxiliary bullets "will not damage the aircraft". 5. The whole landing procedure was so bad that I wanted to puke. SR-71 (of all aircraft) with a pressure seal hatch 7. Opening a cab door to the outside - in the wind - in flight! <br /> <br /> Ah nuts, it was just a really miserable movie. Had to make the list of bottom 10 of the year.
