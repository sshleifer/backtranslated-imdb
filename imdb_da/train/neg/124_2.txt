This movie was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, the godmine, and I encourage you to watch the movie instead. The film has two strong elements, and they are, (1) the realistic play (2) the impressive, undeservedly good photo. Apart from what strikes me the most is the infinite flow of sadness. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. She seems so stupid and with all the nudity in this movie ... it is not attractive. Comparing with Godard's films, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this topic, I would say that it follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A movie of its time and place. 10.2.
