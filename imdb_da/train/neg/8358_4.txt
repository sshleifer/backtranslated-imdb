This is not one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's better films, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all the hard drink so she takes him to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! Once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken for surgery. Then he escapes and is hunted for the place where he meets a sweet girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the staff chasing them, they escape at what time it becomes clear that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon recovered. But he wakes up and after the operation everyone has been a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl, and Dr. Keaton is not as big an incompetent as he thought in the dream. <br /> <br /> A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Sure making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low, but today it was guaranteed to laugh. I would also laugh if there was just something fun to respond to! A lot of energy and that's all. FYI - during one of the chase sequences, Fatty wonders in a race for men over Â£ 200 (wow, what are the odds for that?). And shortly after, he comes back to a post where number 5 was only freshly painted. As a result, the five are now on the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular participant. But the figure should have been backwards on Fatty's shirt, but came out in front of the road - a mistake since they should have realized that the mirror image would have been a retrograde step 5.
