I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after seeing it, I was really disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life, nor any of the others. A couple of the shows made me laugh out loud! The movie was not as I had imagined, after reading the book, which was amazing, I imagined it darker and very scary. If I were Stephen, I'd be really angry! <br /> <br /> I don't know why they changed the end, I thought the book was very good. If you just found out the cake that killed your daughter, you wouldn't feel it to anyone else, would you? <br /> <br /> Book was so much better!
