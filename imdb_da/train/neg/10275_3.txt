The prerequisite is fantastic, and some of the actors, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is close to unwatchable. The music sounds like it comes from a kind of royalty-free online site and the lyrics as if they were written in a reasonable dictionary that was open at hand. Most of the song is off-key. I think they can have filmed with the song accapella and put the music under it ... The dialogue is really stupid and thin. The film works best when it actually speaks of the property, but unfortunately it often goes into stupid farcic subplots. I found myself checking my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when should it end.
