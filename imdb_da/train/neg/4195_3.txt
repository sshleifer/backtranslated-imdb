Considering the people involved, it is difficult to see why this movie should be so shaken and boring. The author, David Ward, wrote the amazing caper film "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Oscar for Cloth, and Donald Sutherland had just done excellent work in films like "Cloth". "Start the Revolution Without Me" and "Kelly's Heroes." Plotwise is the movie a number one, with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big hoist. At the same time, the film will be hip satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the NBC TV show "Saturday Night" would do just over two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced, and the interrupted comedy bits destroy any kind of excitement that the hoist might have. It is quite literally a movie that continues to smash into itself, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other. The only real interest in me was seeing Jane Fonda. Her "Iris Caine" must be a light hearted version of her dramatic Bree Daniel's prostitute character in "Klute". But she doesn't defy a moment. It is always Jane Fonda who pretends to be a prostitute as we see it. It is just as terrible a performance as her performance in "Klute" was amazing. It would be a good lesson for learning teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be big or pathetic. This suggests that actors are just as good as their authors and directors.
