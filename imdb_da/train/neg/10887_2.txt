...... this movie is pretty awful, the only thing that stopped me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that I have unfortunately seen worse. <br /> <br /> The jungle music, juttering demons and fluorescent UV-style blood / teeth / eyes give it the "horrible" look and the script is fierce ..... this movie is more like a test to watch how long you can last before you give up. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing this movie does is in a good way. I saw it 10 minutes ago and thought I would run a little, so there you are. (Oh, and the play doesn't bring down the movie, it's terrible too)
