Something to sing about was produced at Grand National Studios, where James Cagney worked in a contract dispute with the Warner brothers. He made two films for this B study, none of which were high in Cagney credits. One of the big losses in the cinema is that Jimmy Cagney made so few movies that exploited his fantastic dance skills. The two who come to mind right away are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and never steal anything small. Cagney himself said he never used to see anything other than his musicals in retirement. So why did he make so few of them? <br /> <br /> Now it was wrong here. The reason for something to sing about relates to a hoofer who fronts for a band discovered and given a movie contract. There are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press member played respectively and well by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract requires a crime clause, so Cagney and band-girl singer Evelyn Daw marry in secret. Then we get the complication of an advertising-driven studio romance with screen conductor Mona Barrie. I think you can find out where this is going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about something to sing about is the lack of dancing to Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and at the end of the movie and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a good singing voice and the charisma from a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the cinematic public paid their tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> In addition to giving him some dance figures, a female dance partner would have been nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in West Point Story. Wasn't Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> No memorable songs came out of this. And Daw's voice is also numbered. She has a Jeanette MacDonald soprano voice that was out of place with a swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney went back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
