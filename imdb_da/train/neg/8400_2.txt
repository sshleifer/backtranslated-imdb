Not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie (I'm one of them) the stooges are just not giving any material to work with. It is also a shame because it is the only feature length movie that stooges did with Curly, and this one effort of them is painfully unfunny, as it could have had great potential. Terrible music tracks don't help anyone either. The short ones they did with the same title have several laughs.
