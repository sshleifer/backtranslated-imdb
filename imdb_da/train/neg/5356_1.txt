I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with a big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> History and dialogue require a complete renovation. Perhaps the bad play would not have been so noticeable. At least, the stimulation should have been picked up. <br /> <br /> While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually with the small resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write the. Many of the action scenes were just meaningless. <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time.
