One wonders how the manuscript was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other artists are doing an OK job, but since it is neither comedy, romantic thriller nor anything else, it's all pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> One feels that one of the threads had been pursued, it could have been worthwhile. It is nevertheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the US was directly involved in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had anything to do with trying to make a movie for every taste, but ending up with something that doesn't need anyone. <br /> <br /> However, it has historical value.
