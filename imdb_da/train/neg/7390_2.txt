How do you spank up greasy Italian that can barely move a martial arts move without the need for heart medicine? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at its lowest level - since his career began, it has been a steady fall in pathetic over affectionate behavior that has struck his career. In this film, it seems that most of his training consisted of ordering fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day. He is fat, slow and very old in this movie, hardly a martial arts hero, more like a laugh with grin. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire - this movie is about 2 hours why. Plot: Fat Italian Guy With A Great Reputation On the Power, the wind gets a crime group playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate war response. This disgrace, though pathetic and ridiculous, allows for some of the best fighting scenes that include blasting through walls as a cartoon. Did I mention this movie all the way and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I did.
