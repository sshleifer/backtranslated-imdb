1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi Poland, registered by a German cameraman with the naive cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with archive films, clips from international news reader and excerpts from related cultural films to portray World Jews as scammers and parasites. This 'documentary' interprets Jewish life from traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A sincere, cinematically unique expression of racist hatred. I personally find this movie scary and very offensive. One can only hope that such pictures like this will never come back to the screen.
