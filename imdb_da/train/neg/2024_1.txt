Trying to deposit the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100, this lama excuse for entertainment - Show me the money, where 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire. A participant has begun on a sentence such as "Which team lost ..." with three choices, A, B or C, each ending the sentence. The competitor has three options for responding to one of these 3 choices. The host - William Shatner, at his unpleasant smarmiest - asks the participants if he wants to "lock in the answer" and when the participant says yes, he chooses a dancer to whom he shouts "show me the money!" She opens a roll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is deducted. (So ​​theoretically it is possible for a participant in this gloomy debacle to actually settle due to Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the participant chooses the girl who has the crooked roll but he has the answer Properly, nothing happens. If he is answered incorrectly, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he gets one wrong, he leaves nothing. <br /> <br /> Before he goes into advertising, Shatner shouts, "Let's dance" and Shatner, the competitor and the 12 dancers shake prey. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies "a last dance" and they shake it a little more. <br /> <br /> I give this show 6 episodes at the highest, at which point hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (It could have been worse - they could somehow have re-encoded Cuba Gooding Jr to the host, even though I testify he is a better dancer than 'Shat' as they call him these days.) <br /> < 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It only lasted 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
