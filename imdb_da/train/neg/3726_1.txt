I was forced to watch this whole series of movies as a toddler and I was told they were real! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridicule and who want to indoctrinate their children to believe the same. Besides the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also the bad action, poor writing and BAD "special effects". They're just around horrible, horrible movies. Yes, trustworthy (and horrific) to a child, but I can't imagine an adult purchase in this shlock. Although I have to say I would be interested in seeing them today as an adult. They may have a certain midnight / cool movie feel to them.
