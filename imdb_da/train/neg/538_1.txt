Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, both thinking, this has to get better, these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, hackneyed script and alarmless pacing do for long two hours. I couldn't actually hack it and left doing the grocery store (cat litter is more appealing than this movie). The man stayed and confirmed that it did not improve - when Buddy was killed, you wanted everyone to be hit by a car and end their miserable life. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and costumes cannot keep this living.
