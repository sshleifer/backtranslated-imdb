If Deborah Messing wasn't already cast as "Grace", it could be a tolerable movie. But it's simply another story of a frustrated spinster with questions hiring a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she is reading about in a journal article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Neither fun nor externally romantic, the wedding day glides over the grandeur of the fraudulent sex of the bride and the best man and is paid for escort to hand over the movie as four weddings without Hugh, and certainly a dead end for the naive groom who is unaware of his bride's sexual history (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the suppressed princess, 30-something woman with a mistaken relationship history, her neurotic and drunk movements on yet another faux beau are simply the transformation of her television series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that does not rehash what is already at prime time. <br /> <br /> Lots of drunk female bonding, cricket visual jokes and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the movie is a bore with the obvious happy end. Expected Brass Sequence: Divorce Date.
