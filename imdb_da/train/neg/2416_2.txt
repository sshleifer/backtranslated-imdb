2 stars and I'm generous. (smaller spoilers) See, this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland Oakland. As the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a run. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: which zombies ?! All the "zombies" do is green (which doesn't even sound extremely scary) and drops fake red blood from their mouths! No scary eyes, no past due meat, just a bunch of people who grow pathetic and run around like idiots. <br /> <br /> The tire is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole movie, so it's not as if the whole hood is bothered with zombies or anything, it's just a couple and it's in no time. Actually, that act is so bad, it's fun. No one can trade at all in this movie (except perhaps one of the band members), and it seems that a bunch of friends came together, decided to throw their family and made a movie a weekend. <br /> <br /> Final note: since when doctors doctors clothes? Skip this, thank you!
