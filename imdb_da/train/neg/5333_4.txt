A squashy slapstick rod is like a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian-riding champion who leaves rodeo for a stay at home on his people's desert spread in Arizona, where suits have just invested in the family crew of cattle (who have a great need for stud). What director Peter Tewksbury needs is some narrative skills, though he lacks in the assessment he poses in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary is not exactly pointed out, but Tewksbury has a satirical bend to his outlandishness and there are some fun scenes). Despite the colorful support schemes of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general wackiness is far out of hand and there is too much hoopin and hollerin to maintain great interest. As for Elvis, he is loose and healthy throughout - and while it's nice to see him having fun on the screen, one has to wonder if he has just filmed a movie at this time. These shambles of a picture have a separate what-hell feels about it, and although spirits are high, the return is mostly low. * 1/2 from ****
