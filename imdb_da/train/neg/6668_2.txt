The longer this movie continued - and it seemed to be boring forever - the more annoyed I became, the waste of time spent through this total nonsense. How on earth do people make movies this way, or receive funding for such waste? Don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb, as it just turns out you can fool some of the people all the time. And in this picture, the main players have an obsession with weapons, so it's not hard to figure out how this movie will eventually unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how the society in the United States has such an indecent and lethal "gun culture". <br /> <br /> In any case: <br/> <br /> The main actor portrays a loser who escapes to a fantasy world to be a cowboy in an Urban sprawl.He crosses a family of two spoiled abrupt children, a teenage girl and boy; taken care of by a strict single-parent father who can hardly manage. The cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice versa, and the impressing boy is apparently concerned with the loser's lunacy. <br /> <br /> Cowboy is constantly in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser, who prefers to go to the beach, then works to live, then commits a burglary to his family as he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who will see either a sad failed losing in a fantasy world with a death desire or seeing a bad family that is actually not much better than white waste? <br /> <br /> This movie is meaningless drive. <br /> <br /> It only saves on getting the lowest mark possible with half a half-listening music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
