Rebar is an astronaut who goes on the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course this is a horror movie thing ugly and he returns to earth as the only survivor. Struggled with a bizarre condition that makes him slowly melt and think, unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills it apparently the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring state to steal more victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good, but the space scenes are just stuck together out of stock NASA footage and the hospital looks curious as a store. A very weak script, little character development and overall bad acting prevents this from rising above anything other than a mediocre slasher flickering with the news of having a living candle like the killer and more or less only having its gore effects to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for the most deadly monster movie fans.
