Quirky, Independent, Theatrical, Christian Slater - These are all teasers who made me look forward to spending an hour or so "discovering" a jewel of a movie. Boy, was I disappointed. Julian Po never gets over himself. The film is relentlessly self-conscious. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for a moment. The exaggerated, of course, theatrical sets, the overdone, of course the theater actor, the overdone, of course the theatrical director - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not have to be delivered sledge hammer style. And it's hard to feel much about something to Julian Po because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townspeople, the idiotic pastor, the bratty children - why would anyone, especially anyone with a lifelong ambition to get to the sea (Slater's character), decide to stay in such a gloomy place?
