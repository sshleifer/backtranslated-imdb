I can't believe that blockbuster carries this movie. It was so bad. I was totally fooled by the box art. DO NOT FOOLED !! It's not worth your time, I promise you. I don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or whatever. I am so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not match the same! The girl who has voodoo done on her is a stripper. Synopsis on the back says she is only 17. Has that people, Who writes the description for the movie, even likes to see it!? These positive reviews should be a joke, they just have to be. If anyone really liked this flick, then I have lost all faith in humanity. <br /> < And don't even get me started on the story in terms of the title, or the fact that the whole movie was done all in two places, or that the police didn't even have close uniforms, why would I even say it? Compared to the rest of the movie, uniformity was on the spot. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans.
