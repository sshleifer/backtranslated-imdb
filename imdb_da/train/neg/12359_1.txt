I thought it was a really horrible movie - I found myself actually yelling at my TV a couple of times. One or both of the gay leaders were displeased; There was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he would rather kiss a dog. The film covers their long and tortured proposal that highlights every breakdown and make-up, but does not develop the causes in detail. These reasons would create some interesting characters, not the fight or the make-up scene in the bed (even if you liked the movie). Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but it doesn't make the movie worth renting. Save your money.
