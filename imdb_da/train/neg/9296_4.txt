Usually I am a fairly generous critic, but in the case of this movie I have to say that it was incredibly bad. I'm stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some beautiful shots, but it was too bad they were wasted on this washing hole in a movie. It could have worked if "Daggers" was purely an action girl and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between any of the couples, what exists between Mei and her men seem to be more bright than love, and mostly the dialogue is just stupid. This can only be a problem with translation, but the frequent use of the word "flirting" reminded me of the 8th grade, did not coincide forever, worthy of dying - for love; I also felt that we were beaten over by the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters who really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted a remote to rewind, I was random in my room ready to snore, but mostly I just cringed a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now the icing on the cake. Or rather, add insult to injury. The finish was really one of the most horrible, ridiculous I have ever seen. The boys have their deer fight and scream and shout and chop at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Random. Oh, and when Mei (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly pops out of the weed. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach the target, even slowing down mid-screen conveniently to hit a small blood drop. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mei dies because she threw the dagger that was put in her chest and blew to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, the screen becomes empty. Me and the people around me chuckler. Not a good sign. <br/> <br /> Visually astonishing, but ultimately a failure.
