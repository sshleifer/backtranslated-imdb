I give this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible. It was very badly acted, the story was poorly written, the action was incredible. I doubt that even though the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the troops did in this movie. I don't even want to write any plot spoilers because the movie just isn't good enough to plot spoilers. Writing comments on the plot would be meaningless. If I were to compare this movie, I would have to compare it with Fire of Fire, but even though I didn't like the Fire of Fire, that movie was at least better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater left before the movie were even halfway through. The only reason I wasn't because I simply didn't think to do it. I was hoping for a party at CGI and fought masterfully, but that wasn't what happened. The martial arts lasted for all 30 seconds, and it was very disappointing from an exercise routine performed under the flashback scene. The CGI was also not well done. A scene comes to mind. During one of the previous tank fights, the troops fired at ...... nothing. Someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that little movie, so the street was totally devoid of evil. I also think that the evil guy's voice was dubbed by Imotep's voice from The Mummy movies. Had the same scraggly echoing thing going on. (Someone owed some royalties, here?) When I mentioned the fight scene, I would say yes that can be considered a spoiler, but only to the purists, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Don't see it, don't buy the DVD when it comes out either. You have been warned.
