The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the possibility of giving it zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced. For about 75 minutes, you are exposed to the WORST gig (and that doesn't mean in a good way as in KILLER NERD, who had great horror) and a plot not only ridiculous, but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre. The reason I rented this piece of shit myself was because it has massacres in the title. That said, there was only one killing in the whole movie and it was pretty sad. You spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard than anything. Talking about the children, the little boy's actor is probably the most annoying children's actor since bob from the house at the cemetery. Did I mention it was shot on video too? If you want to throw money and over an hour in your life, then watch it anyway. But if you enjoy your hard earned dollars and time, then shrink as far away as possible.
