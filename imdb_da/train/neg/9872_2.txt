Very hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awful! The reason is so constructed and incredible. . . starting with putting a ton of guilt on a young child to save her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and perhaps more people (including priests) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next, we have a wife who apparently in the length of a ferry ride goes from being relatively happy to very quickly kick over the tracks. A very uncomfortable and coo coo mother, supported, supported and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the South Carolina coast, history didn't help, though it might have helped the filmmakers budget. The very beautiful buildings that apparently lived in the monastery did not seem logical to fit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, who I really like, is painfully thin in this movie, and her hairstyle certainly belongs to another decade. There is also simply no chemistry between her and one of the male leaders. I did not like the book from which this was taken, but read it all. The movie, I continued to surf back and forth, had to leave when the saccharine music became too much. Unless you like an incredible story, wood business, a distorted mix of religious / mythological / allegory, my advice is to skip this one. Oh and maybe a little carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scene
