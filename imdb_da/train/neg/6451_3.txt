"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) gathers a group from high school to a cabin reunion where his twin brother Wes went away. While there, a reptile creature in the form of a man (reminded me much of Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) in the desert waits to choose the right time to pick them apart one by one. A biker, Ellen Ripley type, time-wicked ass, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker, she practices experiments while also serving as a security spot from things on the bloody rampage. Kat knows more than she tells (she also suffered a loss of a child), but there is another news fight that most of the group have no idea about. This creature can only be more human than they understand .. and the former identity can shed light on a deception, only another person has been hiding since Wes's death. Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock, as the group stays close to the cabin. Luckily, much of the film keeps away from the creature jumping in the air, while we also see a fuzzy screen as we look through the eyes. The movie features Dawson's Creek Melodramatic, which often prevents any real excitement to build in a small monster movie. The direction is very bland, which leads to a relatively dull experience rather than causing fright. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (The FOG remake) may be the only drawing for this movie.
