The film was completely misleading, and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip-off of Joeseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, the river being replaced by a road, and the boat being a jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <kr /> The claims on the outside of the DVD box were obviously fraud to <br /> <br /> take this manufacturing death by a journalist and present it as actually <br /> <br /> while some portions have Muslims supports the 9/11 attacks on US treatment by Muslims around the world. <br /> <br /> I warned the video store that the movie should be removed from their "Documentary" section and placed in the war drama area of ​​quasi-fictitious accounts of current events.
