<br /> <br /> As usual, I was really looking forward to a new TV / movie on a favorite subject - making a nice change from a * strangely known * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. </ I happily welcomed Pearl Harbor and Enemy to the Gates - but was rudely brought to earth with the realization of Hollywood's viciously stupid force - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on excitement. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was thrilled with 'The Rise of Evil', especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, as I have had his books. I can see why he stopped. <br /> <br /> To quote a guy responsible for this nonsense: "The Kershaw book was an academic piece," he said. "It was <br /> <br /> completely dry. We needed more events." <br /> <br /> Events? Are they completely nuts? Hitler's life cannot be said to be without "incident" - yes Kershaw's two volume Hitler's biographies were long and detailed, but they should be. The thesis behind 'Rise of Evil' seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a very bad man who hates Jews, and only if you miss it will we stress the fact in each scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to try to explain the mood of the time and why Hitler might have adopted the views and strategy he did. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent Nazis - a warning from history - this film neglected to point out that almost all Communist-rise leaders in Munich were Jewish and that this might have colored its views on the subject - and his axiomatic interconnection of the Jews with Bolshevism - a crucial aspect of understanding much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there wasn't much understanding to do - the filmmakers wouldn't go there so we got all the things we knew about anyway. We certainly do not get the fascinating fact that Kershaw refers to, which Hitler has been socialist / communist shortly after WW1. It would of course be too complicated to handle the movie and could even detract from the relentless 'he was very bad' mantra who slips away incessantly. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. But we also know that he was a fascinating figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and of course some ate views such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking that many Guardian readers could accept. He was also famous for animals, which is why the completely invented dog flu scene was so absurd. He was also from all the accounts I have seen, a brave soldier in World War I. While we saw him with his iron cross, we never see how he won it (acts of bravery were not in the script, it was unnecessary to say). We also get no idea why he was so fired by his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and so many others found it so repulsive an experience. And again, just as the point above is the Jewish / Bolshevik link, this is important for everyone's understanding of the subject. Why did he love so much war? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why didn't he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but still took the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly had nothing to say about this either. As all too often these days, the film is a classic example of 'making history relevant to the present' and inventing things or leaving awkward facts out to fit into the 'present' - all too often to take into account the lowest common denominator where you do not trust your audience one inch, so you just hit things in your throat, knowing (unfortunately correctly) that you always get away with it because there are so many stupid fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colors our present, for better and worse. This rubbish was a great option, lost again. They spent millions on it, and the sites and big scenes were impressive, but told us nothing, we didn't already know, and made no understanding of this dark period in human history. <br/> <br /> WT
