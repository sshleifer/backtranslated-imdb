A mediocre Sci-Fi Channel original image. A little squirmish, but not much. The nuclear powered submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep under thick frigid ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by huge supercharged electric eels. A member of the crew (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) believes that she has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but does not get much chance for vague reasons. Also among the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
