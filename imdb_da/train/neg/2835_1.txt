Derek seemed to struggle to find rolls for Bo after "10". <br /> <br /> I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script for "Ghosts Can Not It" can circulate among the trainers in "fish house" where food was prepared for the dolphins. There was a scene where the a-Dolphin supposedly makes Bo (or Bo Dolphin) and asks to "make eggs". We read the script, we lauuughed -... <br /> We don't end up making any part of this movie at our facility, even though our dolphins are in "The Big Blue!" <Br /> <br /> This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he had fun in this movie, as it didn't do anything for his legacy.
