I have seen this piece with already very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather unlikely composer's parade, whose lack of talent is only overridden by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> This was the first comic book I saw that was 100 percent humor free. It is rude, offensive, redneck and blatant anti-women. As such, it is a creation that fits the Bohlen, but the average viewer is rather cut off by it. No wonder it was never shown in a cinema theater: It would have bombed great time! Not even the cost of 6.5 MegaEuros was able to store this incredible piece of crap. Save your time ... and money!
