Isn't it fun when an average schmo, who leads a pathetic life suddenly, has done something outrageously magical to him, turning his life upside down and making him learn some valuable lessons along the way? The formula never gets old, does it? It's such a safe fire way to make a classic movie! Just watch big hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must have been Rob Schneider's mindset when he made half-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed it with The Animal. When I have already tracked the plot through sarcasm, allow me to color it more: Schneider plays a loser policeman who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is rescued through surgery ... by a loopy vet who puts him up with animal parts that make him roar like a horse at inappropriate times, run like a cheetah, etc. This movie is a little more sympathetic than other Schneider star flicks (like another lame-uniform follow-up The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like as if they want the audience to hate it by throwing a reality TV star as the romantic leader (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and inserting a como by Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just doesn't exist. Sorry - nothing remarkable except the production value. I just want to finish this review by saying that small references to other movies in a movie can be okay, but when it comes to lines delivered exactly the same ("You can do it!"), There is a word for it - "milking". In fact, here is another word - "cheap".
