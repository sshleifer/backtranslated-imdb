Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way to the official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), this is perhaps the least deserving of infamy, being a terribly dull jungle clunker who only is very little of a little creepy gore, a free rapeseed scene and lots of nudity. The beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the movie star Laura Crawford, who is kidnapped by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe that cultivates the "devil" who delves into the jungle (a large, nude, smooth native who like to eat the heart of nubile female victims). Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam veterinarian traveling to the island, but encounter problems when the evil ones attempt a double cross. During the confusion, Laura drops into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives who offer her up to their god. Franco, in his usual torpedo style, makes this ridiculous effort with his usual terrible brands: crap gore, dark filmography, fast zoom sequences, many footage, out of focus images, horrible sound effects and skin-fisted editing. The result is a bleak mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of meetings to finish the case) and even the sight of the delicious Buchfellner in all its natural glory is not enough to make me revise this movie in a hurry.
