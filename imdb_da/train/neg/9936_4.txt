Picked this up to 50 cents at the flea market, was pretty tense. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for approx. 15 minutes, then just repeated and boring. It's nice to see Mick and the band in their prime, I wish there wasn't so much over doubling of dialogue so I could hear what's being said and played. The sketches are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, sort of poorly written Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at the end of 60's English relapse rather than what was actually happening in the stupid sketches. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times are really changing and the important thing is quickly silent. Good song, but it has now been played to the death of this DVD.
