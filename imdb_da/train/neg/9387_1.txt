I watched this movie when it was first released. The memory of how bad it was, has been with me almost forty years. I didn't want to rely on my own feelings about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted a movie review published in a big city newspaper the next day sentence confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent, impossible, and uninspiring. A small study shows that the producer was the star of Leslie Caron's spouse, and hence the beginning of the novelty suggests the start of this horrible film. The movie's roster of many talented actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking among others - suggests that it contains some promise. But the death of this movie is due to the horrible manuscript. The implicit "mystery" is so unclear and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer remains confused from scene to scene. The movie seems to be torn between being a detective mystery and a spying thriller, but never settles on one or the other. The sense of excitement is completely absent. The protagonists get rid of playing dry, numb types in a way that doesn't inspire any empathy. The cinema is pedestrian. The result is that the effortless viewer loses interest in the characters, plot and ultimately the actual movie. I'm a little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic movie that can be purchased. I hope that if TCM finds a print of this movie and feels compelled to fly it, it is probably referred to at 4:00.
