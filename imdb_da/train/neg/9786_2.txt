OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths to my friend for a joke that was present on his birthday because the front deck had a sexual induendo in it. <br /> <br /> But we decided to see it anyway. Just for hilarious purposes. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it must be one of the worst movies in history. It started ok and we thought "Ok this can actually be ok". But after approx. Unfortunately, 10 minutes we were wrong. <br /> <br /> It began when the "mysterious paintballs" turned out to be the most obvious character, Scouser / Australian (I say it because he had an accent that couldn't be identified), who's acting I can just say, was immense. <br /> <br /> Then it came to an end, and by that time we had all lost the will to live. Measuring Ball finals. The only thing I liked about this plot is that they didn't actually win, but annoyingly they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name team was given was just awful. Critical damage. I think they could choose a more amazing name, such as "Anti-Christ Destroyers" or something. Or that's what the movie should have been called anyway.
