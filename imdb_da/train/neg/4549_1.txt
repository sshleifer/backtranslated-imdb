Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out-of-work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spearing excessive exhibits and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by Armand Mastroianni's extremely high direction. Though there are visible attempts to measure up to and interesting fans of stronger ticket prices to the unsuccessful ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code", the filmmakers are hardly up to the task. This movie series of mind-boggling mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point.
