Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on a legacy. They spend the money to travel. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs Barry). But they remain as boring as they were before. Seriously boring director Alfred Hitchcock is trying to experience the well-grounded (as quoted in the movie, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange" by ordering some camera tricks. An open greeting to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is the highlight. The low point may be the paired dining on Chinese prepared cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
