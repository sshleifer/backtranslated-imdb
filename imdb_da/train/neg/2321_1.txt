I can't believe this show is not yet a 9 out of 10. I could see if these voices were in the first 2 seasons, but what would anyone have to continue judging it high for it? I was a big fan on the 1st season. I was connected - all the mystery, the excitement, the unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next time. In season 2, I still looked faithfully, but became a little frustrated that some basic things had not yet been explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I love excitement, but you have to throw people a leg now and then to keep them going. Now I can't even remember what I finally got rid of, but somewhere in season 2 I had enough I am not a big fan of showdown - and you clearly can't miss an episode to stop what happens. So it was no longer worth doing for me. <br /> <br /> It's a pity they couldn't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it seems that ABC just became greedy and decided to see how long they could stretch this expulsion. May they not realize that in the end they will lose more fans than they might be able to win.
