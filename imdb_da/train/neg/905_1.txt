An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) becomes pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation, but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the child alone. Things are fine until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager, and things are gradually (and predictably) worse. <br /> <br /> I've seen both the quiet version and the audio version of "Stella Dallas". No one has hit me much (and I cry easily), but they were well-off if they were dated. Attempting to restore this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler had enough power for the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to get this done. This (predictably) bombed. The story is ridiculous and dated by today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado give good performances, this film really draws, and I got sad at the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help support roles. Flimsy and boring. Really - who thought it would work? See the 1933 Stanwyck version instead. I give this a 1.
