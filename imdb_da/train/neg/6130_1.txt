In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position get offered film roles that exist exclusively to exploit it. I have no idea what Thomas was paid to make this movie, but I had to pay a lot of money to agree to make a national fool in a movie. The movie is, of course, derived from "Enter The Dragon" as it is most martial arts images. Only instead of a real martial art, they confront an absurdly new martial art, precisely described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and break dancing". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress, but each room has a prop, that's exactly what Thomas needs to kick assisting evil. Of course, he fights his way to the main cork, and of course they have a fancy-dancy fight, with an end that will only surprise those who have never seen a marshal art movie. There are touches which nostalgic types will suffer, especially the mullet haircuts of Thomas and many of the male co-stars have. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have an angry with Kurt Thomas, who now wants him to never set foot on the movie set.
