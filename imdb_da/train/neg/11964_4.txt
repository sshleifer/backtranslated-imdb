Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this highly secure and comfy comedy drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and growing old. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) that causes him to seek out his alien father (Alan King), a movie extra who wants to be a big star. The manuscript is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liners largely, a flat, expressive direction of Henry Winkler (firm in sitcom mode) and family conflict on the plain. Crystal and King are trying their best, but the King is over-eager and often over-the-top. JoBeth Williams has another of her incredible roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial boyfriend character. It's a comedy, I think, but one that flashes back tears ... shamefully. ** from ****
