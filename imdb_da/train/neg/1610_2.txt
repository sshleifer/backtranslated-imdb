What I found so curious about this movie - I saw the full 4-hour roadshow version, is so weird dispassionate it is. For a film of 2 very charismatic men - Castro and Che, involved in a gigantic political battle, it is almost completely devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (which at best is another level actor, with a bit of high tone) have no drama or depth and come basically down to Castro telling Che: Go here, go there, do this and that, Without explaining what effect or use this action will result in. Odder is still an actor in the cast who has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he shunts aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the excitement or passion expected to burn these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length movie about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles, shouting and shooting for no particular purpose or end. Several of the reviews I have read the noise of director Steven Soderbergh's work while I almost ignore the actors. (In fact, more time was spent talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a strange odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was just a hired gun at the movie and b) it's no more than a competent job with an inappropriate nod to Oliver Stones JFK in the black and white screened camera work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds being directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you will get an idea of ​​the boring skill of this movie.
