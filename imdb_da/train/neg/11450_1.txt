I had to see an early example of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it the way they can to improve it before it comes out on August 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man as his late father. When we meet him, he jumps a mail car on his mop, yes, a mop and almost does it. This would be worth a Jackass movie if he didn't honestly try to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-brother, Kevin, who documents stunts with a video camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. She married Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a really tough guy who enjoys hitting Rod in some real drag out brawls. Obviously, Rod won't respect Frank's respect until he can beat him. We find out that Frank needs a $ 50,000. Heart transplant and Rod are determined to raise money so he can beat his ass when he is healed and prove himself a man. A long fall on a hillside convinces Rod to "go big" on a stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging to do stunts that would make you ring if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch - at a children's birthday party. There they were on the show who managed to laugh at most stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, a sponsor comes together to save the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and creates phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole city turns out and the world joins in. Does he jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise $ 50k? Does the frank get his ass rooted? Wait until this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out.
