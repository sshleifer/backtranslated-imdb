I remember this movie when I was 13 (think many reviews say the same thing AGE 13!) With a group of schoolmates. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie and fell to the typical commercials that tell us this was a great comedy. We suffered about 45 minutes of it, and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from the ability of Billy Crystal to make us laugh, we didn't laugh. I stumbled upon this review by accident and decided to sign up just to tell the rest of the world what it was a root-gut waste of movie, it was now, if you rent this, you deserve what you get, you have been warned !!
