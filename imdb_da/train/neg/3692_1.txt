Rajinikanth is born again after having received a magical power that he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are several issues with this movie that are obvious to the informal audience: The 50ish Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; The father of the girl next door believes that he is a convincing "boy" ('vaseekaramaana paiyan'); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons, the worst thing is how women in yesteryears have their exercise through household work - but we have to believe he is not a thief; Although he was well-read, he wasted six of his seven powers on a stupid dragon; I can continue, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are god-men who are gods and there is Rajinikanth. The catalog has difficulty adapting Rajinikanth to one of these categories. First and foremost, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth, as the Tamil heroes do - standing up to villains and, despite being the elders, being picked up by the most beautiful girl in the movie. Rajinikanth does well, and some of Rajinikanth's brands are actually comfortable - "baba count" is a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that the few initial minutes are just a foreword to a worst book ever to be written. Even that preface is drawn with some comedy that is forced and clear. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero is facing several obstacles (from politicians as usual), but we can't really mess with the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is. Eventually, when everyone wants him to be a leader, the hero gives another of his sermons and goes away to become a hermit. The director does not offer a solution to the problem in the climate scenario. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is really interesting. Either he shows flames of shine, or he doesn't bother to invest fully in this movie - who can blame him. There is a scene where Rajinikanth enters one of the sheds' vans and then throws the knife and starts his baby counter. The music is very suitable for the moment and acts as a catalyst that provides additional tension. The songs are all mediocre, no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb. This movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place after IMDb's ranking.
