"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a good idea can be destroyed by pathetic issues such as pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers from the future are trying to destroy Japan, replacing the local heroes Godzilla with their puppy monsters, the three-headed golden dragon King Ghidorah. They fail, however, and eventually Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between the two behemots are very cool, but the film is full of holes, and all about "Japan is amazing" is really stupid. The creators of this movie did not even threaten to respect the enemies in Japan, making them stupid, big-eyed guys, easily blotted out by the clever Japanese. The good thing is that Gudzilla and King Ghidorah ultimately destroyed both Japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular battles. But until this fight royal, the movie was really boring and pathetic.
