Although it's an R-rated movie, I really doubt you really enjoy it unless you're a teenager <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no sign development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has lots of is nudity. Tones and tons of naked or almost naked chickens (pretty fine, I can add) to attach your eyes. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand why this movie has the American Pie title, as it is only a bad combination of an erotic movie and a comedy without being one of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch only this movie if you want to see some naked chicks, but you are too shy to rent / purchase an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> It gave 1/10 for the 2 smiles I had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for the lovely chickens
