Want to know the secret of making a slasher movie at a gym? You can just put the movie out with lovely ladies in super clothes and get them to bump and paint the floor as if they were with a gentleman's club. That's what the creators of this scary slasher movie did, and the little gimmick kept me looking to the bitter end. This is the worst slasher movie I have ever seen, but every time I was ready to switch channels, they would add another scene to the training girls and I would be put down. As a slasher movie, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls training, it is a success. Strong recommendation to avoid unless the idea of ​​half of the movie is a big T & A show appeals to you.
