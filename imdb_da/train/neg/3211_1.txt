And it falls entirely into the category "awesomely bad" - ie. a movie drunk student would hire to get a kick out. I was at the sci fi film festival and all I remember is a wave of wave of hysterical laughter as this film premiered. Other critics would better describe this film's faecal nature, and I felt so bad at the poor guy from the production company who had come up, of course, to measure the audience's response. What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken pupil, and after a "serious" animated movie I think it was "sky blue", the audience was in a bleak mood, and then this movie began and within seconds all in the room rolled in the islands. I want ball on the worst parts; <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie clings it along a linear and predictable path with occasionally poorly thought out pages. Dirty, but extremely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly finished and put together, if you can put up with wear backgrounds and gradually skimpy costumes for the heroine (I know I can!), then watch out for the Mount where she "trasforms" from a Swedish farmer girl for LADY DEATH! <br /> <br /> Characters: So one-dimensional, it is painful, there is a short backstory (with side-cutting lines in dialogue) and some light is shining on the real motivation behind some of the protagonists. <br /> <br /> So in a nutshell, if you have a caught audience and a few drinks lying around (try and make sure they are alcoholic to ease the pain), then drop this movie into the DVD and entered a "mystery science theater 3000" mindset. There is no other motivation to watch this movie than to laugh at it, and it is not supposed to be a comedy. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ALONE. It might be even more boring to watch solo than "New World" with Colin Farrell, as you will not be able to laugh at the laughter of a friend or two.
