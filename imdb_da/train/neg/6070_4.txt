Tony Scott leads a thriller sports flick that should attract even non-sports fan. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too badly slow. Good recovery! On the outside, he appears to be a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro) while on the inside is a psychotic San Francisco Giants fan. Along comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and designated savior from the doldrums. Our salesman has a murderous occupation when the hard hit the whole star falls into the worst decline of his career, and the hunters are afraid to crumble with him. De Niro is terror personified. Snipes act very naturally as the ball player. Other notes in the casting are: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You're a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and very strong language can be expected and you get your money's worth.
