The follow-up to 1973's much better "Cleopatra Jones" has statue black actor Tamara Dobson, who returns to her signature role as a chic, super-hard drug agent who breaks a heroin ring in Hong Kong. Cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movies is fun from the start, but eventually flags. The Shootout Final is just outside the collection line, and Dobson itself seems less energetic than before (she is still sexy and she puts a unique spin on her comically-styled dialogue, but those surroundings may have been too much of a thing for her - she is jaded). Stella Stevens plays this scrub this time; she is good but can't match Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** from ****
