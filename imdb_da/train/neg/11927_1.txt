Without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I ended up at the end because there must be something here, but no. The plot, when it does not act in clich√©s, hits the point where it does not exist; dialogue that should be street is simply hackneyed; characters never develop beyond sketches; set-pieces are cliched. Worse, considering his co-director, photography is only uneven. Comments elsewhere that raise this along with Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far from the mark; The lives of the saints lack their innovation, let alone their depth and shadow. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor could probably trim it down in a decent 30-minute card, but as it stands, it's a 6th movie project realized on a million pound scale; wandering and inflated with their own predictions. That it received funding (probably only because of Rankin's name), while other small-film cash games are depressing for the UK film industry.
