For yourself, it is best to disregard any positive reviews regarding this movie. This flick STINKS. Now I can (at least in theory) make budget horror movies, but one makes the worst mistake, a low budget flick can do: It takes itself way too seriously. And that is unfortunately not the only problem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the British Ilses murderous Beane clan transferred to modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that immediately confuse this movie when you start to see it. <br /> <br /> # 1 Why is the biggest name on the Jenna Jameson CD box? She is a below average looking woman who cannot act and she has a minor role. ANSWER: She is apparently a well-known porn star (as you no doubt read in other reviews), so I assume this is a "cameo" look to her. She gives the movie a lot of need for "name recognition" it seems. Her top billing is no sign of her talent, but it is an indication of how this is not the case with the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> # 2 How can filmmakers be so stupid to think Canada can be like Ireland? It doesn't even look like Ireland. And the house that the guests / victims live in is this great big North American wooden frame Edwardian thing. They should have skipped the entire Beane theme and developed a story that took place in NA. If you are going to make a movie that takes place in Ireland, it is probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and that was a really really nice Irish accent.) Now it wouldn't have been so bad if the director didn't try to make the next "Living Deads Night", but it seems like he was. Too bad. He could have had fun with it. In fact, some of the scenes were not far from being inadvertently comical as they were. As the infamous gutting scene, where the woman is chained to the table, stripped naked and then cut openly and withdrawn. It's fun, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer pulls out miles after miles in the intestines. It's actually fun after a while. And which self-respecting cannibal eats intestines, anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Hi no, we eat ham and ribs and drums. Oh well. <br /> <br /> Some of the other caste that was annoying: the whiny, eerie Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he should be thrown like a STUD. In fact, he is as big a loser and goof ball as his name would mean. Which would explain why the character, like the just annoying Gillian Leigh fell, fell to him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh on his link on IMDb and it seems important to know she completed high school with honors. I can't tell if it's more entertaining or pathetic to know that just a few years after graduation, honorary students make naked soft core pores in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. Wondering if her former classmates have seen this movie? If they have, hopefully they'll get the message: AVOID THIS FAT! GO TO COLLEGE !!! I could go on, but why. If you like gore, you'll find something redeeming in this flick, but not much more.
