This movie sounded like it could be entertaining and interesting from its description. But for me it was a bit of a disappointment. Very slow and hard to follow and see what happened. It was as if the filmmaker took some pieces of film and threw them into the air and had them spliced ​​together, no matter where they landed (certainly not in order). There was also nothing of any consequence filmed. I have seen a couple of different Korean movies and have noticed that a good deal is well made and requires a little thinking of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one endured me to no end. I watched the movie a second and third time, and it still didn't matter to me. I still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it was just to show a typical everyday part of a person's life, I think he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.
