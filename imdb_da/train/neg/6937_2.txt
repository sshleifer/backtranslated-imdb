The subject that this latest adman-turned filmmaker is trying to tackle in his debut (ad) venture is a rather old topic of discussion with almost any cultural standard - timeless romance (pun). <br /> <br /> The exploration (and exploitation of Desi auds), however, falls tremendously short since the usual inclinations to "pepper, spice and sugar" up to the usual masala blend of b / g score, dialogue, dance , drama etc. creates a nice look with not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen area is repeated at least 8-9 times. Additional repetitions follow the thru-out movie (after all the protagonist's a cook). But there lies the problemos - no story! Haha not strange. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> In a Cheeni Jyada (more) Amitabh puts overactive. Really when will that guy ever stop ?? How many 60-somethings prance around such, even when teased by a nubile 30-something ??? Timeless mind yes, but surely what about the not-so-disrespectful bid? And sole? Sorry, soul? Very good play by Paresh Rawal, who has the only sensible role in the film. The director lacks any sense of realism that everyone gets caught in his newly discovered discovery of a hot new idea. Nowhere are we presented with any real problems or problems that a couple may be exposed to, except getting married, which is only the first obstacle. The sub-plot of a small child with cancer (the boy's first love) goes nowhere, and no matter how little poignancy this otherwise opaque presentation would have induced, is quickly killed with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice attempts, but not quite there yet.
