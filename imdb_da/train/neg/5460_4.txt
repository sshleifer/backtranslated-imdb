Carefully, season 6 in the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there are very few signs of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this "man-in-the-mac" excursion and also "Fade into Murder". <br /> <br /> It is also no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both of the above scripts (he also plays that part of the murdered security guard here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rarely convincing and many of the performing artists just look uninterested with the material. The story is a little weakly developed with some prolonged periods of dull conversation. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here (similar to "Last Salute to Commodore"), but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, Celeste's Holm characterization, intended to give comedy, causes embarrassment rather than laughing. The script wavers off to deal with family history and the killer does enough to gift the Columbo case, although there is never a credible discussion on the motives of her crime. Ironically, Columbo's worst adventure turns out to be the funniest moment in the series. He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a hairdresser / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that Columbo's hair is so perfectly prepared, so he can't afford to pay the bill, and when he asks with a jeweler, he is happy in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it's been paved in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo finishes.
