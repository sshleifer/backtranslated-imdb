Do you like to get up? So stay away from this ... In the early rounds there are actually good comics, but unless they got some sweet qualities, they got a snowball chance. Any controversial material and you're out! ... and I think I've been hurting as much as the discarded comedians when I see who the crooked judges are getting into. <br /> <br /> 1 out of my top 4 went beyond the preparations. Half of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges do not seem to have problems with. It is more entertaining than much of what is otherwise on TV, but it is incredibly difficult to see without considering what it might have been. <br /> <br /> If the manufacturers changed the name of the contest to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism would lose validity. Maybe an idea?
