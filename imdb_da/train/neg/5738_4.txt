"Dark" was entertaining to some extent, but it never seemed to have a plot, missing one more so than other films that have been accused of this damage; i.e. "bad taste". It started really well, with a man running from something. It was very scary in those first few minutes, but after some time the movie was just entertaining at the level of gore, which was difficult to do at some points due to poor lighting and terrible recording quality anyway. The movie was hard to believe because of the young action that most seemed to be like some friends talking to a camcorder and making lines up as they went. That, with no plot whatsoever, made it look as if the movie was started without and ended without a script of any kind. As mentioned earlier, Gore was the only point of drawing, how much of the time it was difficult to make.
