Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" or "Big Trouble in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarian" which is terrible movies that have some coolness and self-defeating humor that makes them cult feelings, The Golden Child Bare bad. <br /> <br /> The pastor himself is not useless and there are some fun moments. But here Eddy Murphy kills "flip attitude" just any sense of excitement or danger in history. And the special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mysterious secrets" of the Tibetan Buddhism are lights instead of being forced to force. <br /> <br /> Without a feeling that something is at stake or that the characters face real danger, why should we take care of it? br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Big fans of Eddy Murphy who can't help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can't think of anyone else <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
