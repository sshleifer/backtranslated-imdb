You've probably heard this phrase when it comes to this movie ?? "Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap" and yes it is true. This movie is really awful and completely paralyzed. <br /> <br /> This should be the second worst movie Lindsey is ever in since the Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen page. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the talented cast that is far better than the movie million times and is the only selling point in the movie. I can't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, isn't he reading the horrible manuscript before he logs on to be in it? <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about this movie is also based on how Herbie is surreal and imaginative as extraordinary ability and climb on the wall and go faster than a racing car after all just a Beatle. I know it's a kids movie, but they've gone overboard with it and it just gets stupid than entertaining. Little realism is needed plus the story is too predictable. Final Words: Unless the children are actually 5-12 years old, I doubt very much that anyone can enjoy this meaningless movie. What a waste of my money. I want to cheat. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
