Words really can't describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least there were some good shots and the occasional good chin stroke here and there to stop you from nodding. This is just ridiculous! Terrible script, bad direction, horrible acting and you know what? I can't think of a single thing to recommend about anything other than that it's not too long. If you want 100 minutes of entertainment, order yourself at the dentist and have some root canal work - much more comfortable and much better value for money (provided you need it!). Incidentally, I have to write 10 lines of text to complete this review - DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT'S AWFUL!
