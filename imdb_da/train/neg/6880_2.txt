I was thrilled to hear that someone had made a documentary about how it was to be Puerto Rico. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered ... could she probably know what it really is to be Puerto Rican. As far as I knew .... she was a Nuyorican. Well anyway, I sat with my popcorn to see. I realized 10 minutes in that my original apprehension was right. Rosie Perez has some knowledge of how it is to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more a first hand, very personal account of how it is to be a Nuyorican .. and all that it entails. She (like most Nuyoricans, I know) has an emigrated, partially and sometimes distorted sense of history. (How could they not .. they live here.) Yes, they are all proud. As they should be! But much does not know about the history, history and political background or language of the true culture. It all became very clear with her participation in the Vieques question. Whatever my personal take is on this issue. I know at least what the hell the fight is for. There she is being arrested for something she knew a little about ... and only participated in because it was a "Puerto Rican fault", I really do not understand how she is not embarrassed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, you can see this as a sharing account of a woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Don't take this as a gospel ... much of it isn't even true. Consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This movie is not and should never be for other Nuyoricans, the base of their information. Instead, just a step toward finding more information, learning and debating what reality is. Not just the one coming from this woman's eyes.
