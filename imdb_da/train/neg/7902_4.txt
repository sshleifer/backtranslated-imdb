Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlin clone that comes out of the 80s. I'm not much of a fan of imitations. <br /> <br /> First, it was the outstanding 'Gremlins'. <br /> <br /> Then came the very average 'Critters'. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the miserable 'Ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But the complete pits would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'. Is there more ?? <br /> <br /> For me, 'Munchies' for me must fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. In fact, I found it more entertaining than 'Ghoulies', but I preferred thst's darker tone. <br /> <br /> From the get-go it plays its greasy nature (as it is better for it), but because of that, the hammy actor (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) can become more indulgent that you rather just watch the munchies run crazy. This is where fun arises. But in essence, light-haired fluffs, as the story primarily relates to the munchies (who are either hungry, horny and devastating) in a lot of suspected comic encounters (some moments work) in the little desert town like a few people are on the hunt. It's stupid, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look pretty gentle and poorly detailed, as they are basic dolls that are chucked about. Where their personalities come from is that they can actually speak ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who were in 'Critters') were fair leaders. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also pops up. <br /> <br /> Amusingly low-entertainment for the indispensable.
