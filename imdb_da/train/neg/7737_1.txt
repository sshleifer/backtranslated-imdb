Who in the world told Harrison Ford that it was a good role for him ??? <br /> <br /> And Josh Hartnett ... how can a 19 year old who doesn't burn a gun become a policeman? Over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry came to look like a surprisingly bad movie !!!
