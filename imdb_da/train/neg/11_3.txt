If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, there is apparently a movie called "Reload" in production (from June '08), where he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. First of all, how does such a crazy movie ever make a sequel ... and secondly, Sebastian was not killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I saw this in the early hours of the morning when I was sleeping, and then I drove in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but generally it seemed very weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised by all the people who comment on the beautiful girls when I thought the actor who played Brooke was beautiful but not unusual.
