Don't you just hate when you order steak, but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> That's what I felt like looking at this so-called "Battlestar Galactica". Arguments can be made over their quality, but in fact it is not what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine sitting down at the proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You've been waiting years to bring back their famous New York Strip steak you loved. When your meal arrives, you find that they have used the name "New York Strip" for a chicken bowl. You complain but the waiter just says "but she looks, ees really good zir"! Are you really interested if the chicken is good? You Wanted New York Strip - a STEAK! The waiter then explains, "You would like to do what you would do as you saw, Zomezing NEW. We felt she should be more popular so we gave it the name of our formerly delicious deesh". You ask if you will ever find the original New York Strip on the menu in the future, but are informed that because the restaurant has a bowl called "New York Strip" now on the menu, you will never see the original New York Strip - Ever again. <br /> <br /> That's the way to create something new and relax with "Battlestar Galactica" namesake. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series is a front end for all fans of original shows! * <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the production team responsible for this new version naturally disregarded the original. The team responsible for reviving BG should have loved the original series - seeking to improve what the lovers loved, and not trying to shamelessly sell this new series by utilizing the Battlestar Galactica name. <br /> <br /> If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a new show, do it! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we remember with joy in an effort to entice the viewers. It effectively deprives us of the opportunity to see anything in the future. <br /> <br /> We've been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we LIKE something about the original! We did not just want the name and remnants of the basic concept. There are things we LOVED about the original series! Unfortunately, the best elements of the original were those that were omitted <br /> <br />. Sure, the original BG was imperfect and could have used some updates. However, this mini-series was not an improvement in any respect, but the special effects (which were good but nothing unusual by today's standards). Many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this NEW show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> It is said ... I will give some comments on the benefits of this new mini in itself (not in comparison with the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. Of course, the effort was put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". I didn't want to say that these sequences were unusual in today's standards, but they were in line with original films made for cable. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live cam"? Some views attempted to fake the effect of a "real" camera with poorer tracking and jerking zoom. However, it was overused given that there were no apparent SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only instance I have seen such "live cams" used effectively, as we apparently witnessed action by Security Cams. <br /> <br /> The script asks you? The scripture felt as if it was written by a teenager, for other teenagers. The characters felt cardboard and stereotype. In fact, the whole story felt pieced together from other known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were the few elements that were preserved from the original series. It was, of course, "stupid" for the digestion of your average television audience. <br /> <br /> The human interaction was miserable. Instead of drama based on subtle looks, expressions, and fine timing, every moment of human excitement was exaggerated to be so obvious that they lost all the ability to move any refined seer. This was evident in any interaction between Adama and son. The director must have tried to make sure that the most dense and unpleasant viewer would not miss it even though he was not aware. Sorry, but real people don't behave like they do. I wouldn't have considered it as a BAD show if it was alone. Nothing good; It will never be honored by true SciFi fans or artisans, but it would be visible to the masses. I could personally have lived without it, though. I only looked at how it really was to capture the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> How this mini-series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how the quality of the story has been thrown aside to appeal to larger numbers. Where even the SciFi Channel has "stupid" its productions to accommodate the masses as opposed to the true niche market, Science Fiction fans. This is the time we asked for steak, and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with only one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
