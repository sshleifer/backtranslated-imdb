I searched for a copy of The Forest because I looked at a VH1 special, I think "Where Are They Now" and watched the video box flash across the screen under a segment of the actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male joke in this horror horror, but I remember him from his character Freddy at Silver Spoon's TV show. This flick is a big letdown. There is nothing here. It actually took me four months to see it from start to finish. I stopped stopping it in boredom, put it aside and forgot about it, so stumbled and tried again to get through it. Of course, the angle of this film intended to separate it from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparatus. And of course it doesn't work here. I can't stand the male leaders. I expect them to look down on their palms during the longer dialogue scenes to read cheat lines. The situation at the start, where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and generally silly. I suppose the only positive thing to say about this is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. It's pretty good to make makeup there. Man, I really reach for a positive now, huh. The only other non-budget horror movie on one level as bad as this would be Home Sweet Home.
