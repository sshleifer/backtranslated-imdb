Normally, I support independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... I usually support everyone because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> but this movie only moves away from all understanding tolerance limits! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the truly WORST horror movie you've ever seen in your life so far. <br /> <br /> 2. Think of some nice, attractive ART for the movie's DVD box ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> see it only if you really have nothing else to do better. Something is better.
