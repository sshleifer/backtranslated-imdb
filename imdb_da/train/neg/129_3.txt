I am curious are really two films in half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political / socialism. Regardless of the instructor's intention, the two do not fit properly together. The director should just have the fence with the romantic side of Lena and make a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mix of political / war meetings, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flop breasts and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Aside from the interesting sex scenes, you will be bored with daring and watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think naked / sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The sweeping nudity is a great distraction from the infinite plot there is. I think the cast did a good job though. They played their parts credibly. There is a bit of over-the-topness that I am so used to seeing in the American movies during this time.
