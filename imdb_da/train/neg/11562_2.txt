Wealthy widower Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and British Lord. He brings sexy red-haired women to his castle, where he whips and kills them. Black-booted stripper Erika Blanc (like Susie) comes away temporarily. Mr. Steffen is haunted by wife "Evelyn" who died in childbirth. As a therapy, he decides to marry again after meeting beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). At the end of the movie they have had to dig a few graves. "Night Evelyn came out of the grave" is at least a big title. <br /> <br /> ** La notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla tomba (1971)
