Oh God. While Chevy Chase and the band at SNL set new heights with the sketch show format, it fails to fail at all levels. Luckily, the Chevy is barely in this at all and cannot be attributed to this complete tripe. It is seriously very, very bad. While it was supposed to be a political commentary on the United States at the time of its release (1974), it is still not fun or acute. The sketches are far too long and any satirical influence they may have lost is lost as they are all drawn to complete boredom. This is credited as Chevy's film debut, and I'm happy to say that everything he did after this improved it. Avoid even if curious.
