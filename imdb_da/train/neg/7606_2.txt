Beverly wreath was born at the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, giving power and grace to even such lame flicks as the Corman films she stared into. In Gunslinger, she is the city's sheriff's wife. He gets offed so she takes over her job to pursue her kills. She is better than the material she works with, by far. The film is gray, stalked and most boring. There is some (unintentional) humor with the tire tracks everywhere, people running behind a building to suddenly come in front of someone else (I've heard of fake fronts, but that's ridiculous!), And the newly widowed sheriff falls in love with the guy who is employed to kill her. Although she had not loved her husband, it had been nothing like a week or two since he was dead! And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end, anyway. Not good with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The lead of the play is another woman, the salon owner. She plans to buy a lot of land just if the railroad goes through and makes her rich. Her action plan, if it's not pretty boring, she'll just steal as much from the city as she can and skedaddle. Hell, it's just her and her hired gun at the end of a whole city. Are you telling me that these people are not armed? See what happened in true cities in the Old West when the bank robbers came in to rob the bank, and they were cut into a shot of bullets by the armed and dangerous city people. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of pointless talking and riding around, interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. The ending is as cruel as usual in a Corman flick, although it is good-natured, lacking the moral proselytization at the end that was in the conquered world. The sheriff passes her badge to Sam Bass and rides into the sunset, even though the movie was so gray you never saw the sun.
