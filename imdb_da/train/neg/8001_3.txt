MONSTER - He was great; I loved the special effects that created this monster that resembled an updated version of "The Creature From the Black Lagoon." The scenes with this animal roaming the land and capturing humans varied from good to jaw. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Much of the story is in the quarantine area, as doctors (under the auspices of the government) state that SARS-like illness is out there. In a nutshell, we understand the well-known government's cover story. You know, I expect this liberal paranoid thinking with Hollywood movies always paints our government as corrupt, but it seems the Koreans are copying the format and it is very boring. From here it takes away from the excitement and excitement of this "monster". It just pulls the movie down. The main film in the film has to look from a distance, while the young girl in their family, supposedly dead, was pulled by the being. <br /> <br /> MORAL: A typical "does not pollute the water" message because this is what can happen - a terribly mutated monster. This used to be the announcement of the 1950's atomic bomb, as radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish, or anything in these schlocky sci-fi movies. Now it is "environmental issues" that are the focus. <br /> <br /> HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I usually laugh at slapstick, but it wasn't fun. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is so pitiful or that the film intentionally tried to be ultra-corny with a take on the old "Godzilla" movies. Let's hope it's the latter. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - Video transfer was good. This was a sharp look and sound was decent with a lot of rear speaker sound. I saw this in Korean with the English subtitles. It could have been a mistake as the Korean guttural voice sounds annoying after half an hour. OVERALL - This had a promise, but turned out to be a big disappointment and even boring on too many spots, which is inexplicable for a modern monster movie. Two hours were too long for this story. How this movie drew record volumes in Korea, I do not know. They must not have much in the way of movies to enjoy and support.
