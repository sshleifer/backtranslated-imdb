Eric Rohmer's "The Lady and the Duke" is based on magazines from an English aristocrat who lived through the French Revolution. But it is a stylish affair, with its strange, painted scenery and exclusive conversation tone. Mostly, this portrait of the age of terror is almost entirely on the one hand removed from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and a bit of chaos, poverty and terror unfolding away from the sign of the persecuted but pampered aristocratic classes. The result is often dull and ultimately irrefutable about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; It is a disappointing film from a recognized instructor.
