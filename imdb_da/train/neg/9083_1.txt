It was so terrible. It wasn't fun to see at all. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator, even it is not fun to see in this movie. I say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to see. Or maybe if it was the only part of the movie you watched, just girl on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should just have released one scene in theaters, maybe the movie would be fun at a certain level. My advice, fast forward to the point, watch it, rewind movies, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you can enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way. This movie goes along with I spit on your grave and Doom generation in the category of worst movies I've ever seen.
