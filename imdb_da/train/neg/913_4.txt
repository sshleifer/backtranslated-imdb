OK now, let's see. What was fun in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people who fall into the water, stupid boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this film, they have the twisted accent portion to the maximum, not good. A whole lot of people fall into the water for uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams they tried but failed. There is also the possibility of personalities they follow in this movie. This film should be about what happens on the water, not on land. I'm sorry to say that the fun parts are too far away and the film's sponsors are being exploited to the maximum. Not good. All in all, I give it four out of ten, as it has some fun parts.
