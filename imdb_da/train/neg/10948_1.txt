What did they think of "Cannes"? One of the most annoying movies all the time. Every detail of this movie, no matter how pointless was shown. If I had to see her on those boots again, I think I would have shouted. If the point of this movie was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had, it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and then the credits would have been running. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over again. It was all filled with unsigned and unsympathetic signs. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to believe that I passed "Tumbleweeds" to see this overheated movie of boredom. It was like seeing grass grow, it's just more exciting.
