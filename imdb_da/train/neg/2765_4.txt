How this movie was made with an alleged budget of $ 70 million and without being completely reproached is behind me. History and dialogue are beyond amateur. Signs say things no real person will ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The action of the leaders is fine as the writing is such a dud ... but several actors in supporting roles really pull down production. The hero's hair would probably have got its own credit, it was so oddly attentive - grip ... not to mention that it gave one of the better notions in the picture. Finally, this movie is shockingly boring for a film about L.A., besieged by giant reptiles. What a shame! If you see this, your mind will continuously run, think of ways you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it would not have taken much.
