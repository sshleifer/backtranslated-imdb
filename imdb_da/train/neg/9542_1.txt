I don't know what's more to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said. I really only have to be angry with myself. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a terrible piece of shit, but I loved War Games so I spoiled my whim. I want to live to regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the beginning, when the government's people explained that their supercomputer could decide who a terrorist was just about how well they played a video game, I knew I was on a trip, even though the land-it-credited-forgotten. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialogue and action is so long that I would break down IMDb if I tried to send it. To the people who said they saw worst movies than this, tell me. I'm actually curious to see something that could top off this steaming pile of horse mating.
