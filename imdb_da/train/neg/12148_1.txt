Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating ?? I think the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This movie is no more than an amateur, or possibly a movie. I am a movie fanatic and have seen horrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and the play were the worst I have ever seen. The props, including the use of toy airsoft weapons with terrible special effects, where just as bad as anything else. I am too poor a language in movies, but the F bomb was dropped every three words and I think we might have a winner for most use of F-Bomb in any movie, EVER. The movie also seems to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not really movies. I expect this will get awards for an amateur movie that only appears in public access points around the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will never come back. Unfortunately for me that time has been lost, but it is not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.
