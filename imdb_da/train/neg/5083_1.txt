I find it quite useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment on. It looks like a rotten egg that has no good to show to the world extract because it is the mess that other infinite numbers of eggs have been before it. But since a commentary is obligatory for such a gratuitous insignificance ... Filth is certainly the right word to describe this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "movie" directed by Lucian Pintilie, who insists on portraying the so-called "Romanian reality "after the communist era (1990 for contemporary days). Under no circumstances is it recommended for people outside Romania as for the others (who recently find amateur cameras, lack of plot lack of director / actor's quality etc, noise etc as trendy and even artificial): watch and enjoy this "movie "(as I know you want), but do the other well-meaning IMDb members a favor, don't write an online review because it will misguide, annoy and eventually waste their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie has some value, among other things, an educational one showing the example: "How NOT to make a movie."
