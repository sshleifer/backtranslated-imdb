Second-tier American leading man Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this Spaghetti Western ?? which with very modest credentials appears as essentially routine (although there is a good enough score). The reason gives some mild interest: Incidentally, the title refers to a wounded man who is involved in the murderous attack of the pistol runners on a ranch ?? The property of their successor family, Madison's cavalry. The latter's younger siblings are determined that the injured person who is now responsible for them leads them to the responsible gang leader, ultimately showing the identity of any mysterious man a surprise? and both are ironically involved in one of Madison's sisters (another being raped during raids). Euro-Cult starlet Rosalba Neri looks like a salon hostess and Madison's ex-flame unremarkably.
