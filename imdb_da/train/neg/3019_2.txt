how can you take her live living, glamorous violent bounty hunter story seriously with * at * accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the director's visual style is vicious and gimmicky, the plot is a low, boring, confused gangster movie rehash and the play is convincing. The film introduces new characters throughout the movie and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of order - apparently just to keep you cozy and confused. The movie shows you ever things that don't really succeed and later says "it didn't really happen, it happened" - see (apparently) the killing of the (false) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong event sequence of then? <br /> <br /> Terrible choice in casting, a distorted, messy plot and a headache-causing directorial style. 1.5.
