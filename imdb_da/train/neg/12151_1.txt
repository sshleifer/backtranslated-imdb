This is possibly the worst act I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what happens to the casting. The leading lady in this movie has a kind of nose formation and is almost impossible to watch for some time without being fixed on the nose. You could go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified, better-looking possible leading ladies. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This movie looks like it's just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I'd rather have spent that hour or so that this movie was watching public access television ... at least the special effects are better and people who are more attractive than anyone you want to see in this movie
