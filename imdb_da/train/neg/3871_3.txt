I try to be very objective when I see a low budget film. I also use a lower weight on independent and low budget productions compared to the big budget productions. I almost expect freedom from major budget productions and their studies. Therefore, I apply tighter criteria for the large studio releases. But this movie was just a dud. Period. The premise was terrible. The protagonist, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a high school senior with an indelible desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or her plays that drew you into her world. Also, to make this movie more mysterious, the lighting in some scenes has not set the mood, especially in the store. <br /> <br /> Once again, a disappointing movie that I could only give three points for.
