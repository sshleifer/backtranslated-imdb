The film was written 10 years ago and another director planned it with SRK and Aamir starring <br /> <br /> The movie was finally made with Vipul Shah, who directed it. And Ajay and Salman starred together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> The movie, however, disappears due to the 90's handling and the worst is the loopholes. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also have the love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable and cinematic and too clich√© <br /> <br /> There are loopholes Like how Ajay runs away from London Airport and makes room for himself without anyone? Even the way he starts his band is not convincing. The second half gets better with the twist of Ajay's tale of destroying Salman, but unfortunately the climax falls short and the movie ends with a bad note. <br /> <br /> Direction of Vipul Shah is common to below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocre <br /> <br /> Among actors, Ajay gives his best shot even though he is not convincing as Rock songs, but he does great as the negative role However, Salman annoys with his Punjabi and speaks nonsense he impresses only when he gets drug and then Asin is nothing big just a show piece Ranvijay must stick to MTV About Puri is okay
