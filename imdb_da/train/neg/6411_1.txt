The Return is one of the films for the niche group of people who like movies that drill and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame businessman who doesn't kill vampires or gets naked at all throughout the movie. I was willing to do this, but I was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with meaningless flashbacks. At the end, it turns out that she is colliding her car to herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong, and it was just a flashback. With this movie it is impossible to tell. Can you believe the same guy who made the Army of Darkness produced this crap? A much better idea is to stay home and see the Army of Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. The movie had everything: sluts, zombies and a guy with a chain saw to an arm. The Forgotten did not even have these things.
