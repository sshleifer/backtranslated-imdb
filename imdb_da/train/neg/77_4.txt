I saw this movie opening weekend in Australia and predicting with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the final story of Ned Kelly would unfold for me. Despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead, the plot was paper thin .... which didn't inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were some other pluses, the support from Edgerton in particular secured the direction from Jordan (confirming his talent at the show in Buffalo Soldiers) and production design that gave a real sense of hardness to the Australian shrub, much like the Irish immigrants from the beginning The 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another option has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?) .... in what I suppose is a Hollywood concession and selling the picture in USA. Oh yes, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose the beard just to please Universal ... Guess I just have to satisfy myself with Peter Carey's excellent "Kelly Secret History of the Kelly Bande". 4.10
