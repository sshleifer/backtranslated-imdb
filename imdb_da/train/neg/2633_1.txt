I watched the movie's trailer several times at the theater and I was excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like those made in the 1990s. It also reminded me of Fugitive movies, a cat and mouse hunting between Douglas and Sutherland. But Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller all the time. As I see, many people say that this is like a television movie. Not exactly. Firstly, there is much more better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, television movies can sometimes be very fun, but this movie is the exact opposite of having a good time. It is not at all stylish visually, and the most important thing is that the film is uncomfortable. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consisting of a chase and a clash. Also, they are not big action scenes, but the worse is that these action scenes are very tasteful as the whole movie. The love relationship between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the murder of the president is the most clich√© story in this genre, but they insist on it. And it's not a cat and mouse movie it should be. Although Douglas is very old now, he still has the potential to perform in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can't be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is also a wrong choice because you feel like you are seeing Jack Bauer and somehow the character is one of the reasons for making the movie as a TV movie. Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or right in this movie because she is a soap opera actress. The movie wasn't fun even a second for me so I couldn't get over a while.
