This movie is pretty bad. The action is immense and completely compulsory. By shooting the movie as a docudrama it doesn't necessarily make it more credible, you can't get out of it so easily Mr. Dir. However, do not let my comments mislead you as I would recommend seeing this movie as it sheds light on the psychology or non-existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. But the highlight of the movie is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it on! It's clean and simply fails to catch any sense of atmosphere! What is going on does not translate me into feelings of desperation, panic, fear or fear that one would probably experience in such frightening circumstances. No one else it leaves you with jaws "Was that it?!" Waste from your tongue and in no way are you haunted by these boys' actions. Instead, you just feel embarrassed by another movie that started with the potential, but ended up falling flat on the face at the most crucial point. Zero Day indeed .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
