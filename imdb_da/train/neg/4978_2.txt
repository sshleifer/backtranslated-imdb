This movie has lost me with RPG (rocket-driven grenades). It was as if someone cut and inserted a scene from Robocop. I half expect that Beowulf says: "I like it!" <br /> <br /> I saw this because I like Chris Bruno from "The Dead Zone" TV show and he did his part. He chose a weird accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie - unlike any of his costars. They continued to slip into all sorts of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material. But even on its own, this movie's plot is not good. It's just boring as even the low budget doesn't apologize. Having a low budget means that you must at least have a good history, dialogue and decent action. These things don't cost much. Instead, they spent their money on CGI and some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
