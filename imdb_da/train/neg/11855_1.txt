This is one of the movies shown on cable the same two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives as they iron. The action is second rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to be sleeping throughout the movie. And God helps Gina Gershon. Her accent is also over the top. It doesn't sound like a true English woman. It sounds forced and false, like her plays. She should adhere to what she does best, lesbian showgirl-con artist who plays in rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. empty, stupid and stupid. How should we be interested in these people. At one point, Christy Scott Cashman is lost in Central Park. Really? Navigating Central Park is not that difficult. Just follow a road out. Not only did I care about any of the characters, I had actually hated them. The only reason I was with this train wreck of a movie was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying fish. Each scene is typically romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us. The script was terrible as it was the actor. If you catch this fish throw it back!
