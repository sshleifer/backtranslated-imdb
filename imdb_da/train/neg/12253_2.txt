I never thought a movie could be so horrible, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible play, horrible plot, horrible effects. The crocodile was horrible, and for the stupid sex / killed scene in one, it was a bad move from the word go. It was really shocking and it's not a compliment! How can anyone make this movie, look it back and then say "Yes, it's a good movie. People want to watch that" If you haven't seen it, I DO NOT ask you to :-(
