I couldn't agree with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be completely boring and uninspired "content law". He can produce eye-candy (and I like candy), but its pretentiousness and basic artistic emptiness just reduces all joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar (but only on the surface) works of Jodorowsky or even more linear filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love the 2001 Odyssey and were never bored through The final scenes ...) The kind of art that M.Barney's marks add to the confusion and avert the viewers who might otherwise begin to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check out his interviews. I'm just not buying it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I was never sad to see Alejandro Jodorowsky's movie, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a big disappointment. Particularly while offering the opportunity to be something, actually telling something in a non-linear, unorthodox way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and the preparations for the ship to sail out. Ships "meeting" on the sea ... Ideas of faeces as an object of value (if it was stools). These "pearl" divers ... Anything could construct a great surrealistic movie with some content, but it didn't.And the awful pretentious scenes of dressing up and false tea ceremony .. How vain and fake and philosophically pretentious, but empty, can it get it? <br /> <br /> I have some pretty picturesque scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and false that it made me physically ill. <br /> <br /> And it's not a good pace, I like slow motion movie, but it was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was just forced to be a witness for long-lasting scenes of artistic ancestor nonsense ... <br /> <br /> That kind of movie only kills art and spiri t in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
