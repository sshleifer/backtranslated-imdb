It's so sad. Though this was shot with movies, I think it stinks a little more than flicks like Blood Lake, there's nothing out there. The music they play in is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I like brother and sister in this movie. They both try not very hard to sound sarcastic when they say things like "My friends should be so jealous!" Hey, what has the killer only wearing his mask at the beginning? It's retarded! I practically ignored the other half of this. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses the ax. The same exact sound for each chop!
