In my Lit. class we just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mother was cheating on her father in a station wagon, not in the forest where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother cheats with does not have black hair, he has a blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old cannot beat his fist through a window of a stroke. <br /> <br /> And for the actor, the child playing Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I think the landscape was impressive, although I very much doubt the director himself read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you haven't read the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, start a complaint letter to the director.
