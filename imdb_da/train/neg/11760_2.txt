Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion going on. First, how do you know which movie you buy? Henry Cele stars in each of them. I bought this movie thinking that it was the miniseries ... WHAT A LETDOWN !! It would have been a comedy, but the young girl was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is ok for popcorn TV, but he wasn't credible in this movie (where was his English accent?) And what's with the story of love ??? The movie was about a young man's rise to military power - not the slave commander is jiggly with the English virgin looking for his father ... <br /> <br /> If I had paid more than $ 7 for this movie I was supposed to call the police - because it would be a crime!
