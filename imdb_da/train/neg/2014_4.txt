I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen. It was ultra high tech for it's time. It could reject the enemy fire, make all sorts of acrobatics in the air and take almost everything that way. Now I go back and see it today and am surprised at how miserable this show is. The casts members are hardly convincing, there are many cheesy moments, and battle scenes are incredibly false. And almost every end has the same helicopter battle with the obvious reuse of grain low quality stock footage. Lots of footages look to date from the Vietnam War era. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has virtually the same theme as Knight Rider, unless the chosen crime vehicle is a helicopter instead of a car. After seeing a few episodes, I found myself bored. However, I love the theme music.
