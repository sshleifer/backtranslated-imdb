The reason is so manipulative, counting completely on the most unpretentious and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each parent's decision. The kids are super as much as the charm and delivery of the lines, but as I say, the whole plot depends on the fact that each adult is complete idiots and therefore in that case makes more sense out of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total distrust). Why would cute charming little boys take a baby off the coast? How did the baby come to the coast and at the same time draw to be the last place to be sought? Why should the 2 boys NEVER be informed instead while a baby is missing, no one gives a fig about those who run around with food and nappies with all the evil going on and literally every other place it was looking for? There is no justification for asking the public to believe in this. Praying to believe it would do right (even the informal attitude) is too abusive to shave.
