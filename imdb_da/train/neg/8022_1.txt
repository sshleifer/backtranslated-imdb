I see that someone was already thinking of a similar analogy that looked like the first thing to think about when I watched this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. Besides the sexual scenes that border on child pornography (which I think might have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature than graphically, I would look like this movie on a recipe that has been torn in half. It is like being delivered a list of ingredients, without directions on how to put them together in a finished product. From the start, lack of character development and history development ... unfortunately we are many times in this monotonous drive driven by bit of plot and we think "Ahh-OK ... finally we will find out more about why this scene is ... or ... who this character is ... or maybe we will finally get to know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and involve more with this interpersonal relationship ... etc. "But not so luck! On the contrary, I was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stick it out when the carrot was dangled, only to find that whatever mini-plot within for w Hatever's mini-plot (and the badly presented) was just a ruse. Why I stayed with it until the end is a mystery than usually IFC has better choices and they gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters don't like to some degree or that you can't identify with them or their humanness at all ... it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort. I notice that this was shot around Santa Cruz and found myself wondering if it was someone else's film school project. I wish I could have given this a better review, but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.
