When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey, and this showed at a 4-D attraction (you know the attraction that the seats are moving). I find that the version I saw was an abbreviated version (15 min.) And also recreated to add the motion effects. It was a cute movie ... but it was. It was educational and told about the first mission, but the end of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... trite. I wasn't a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to any parent who wants to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I would say that the actors were well-chosen and the characters themselves were sweet. So all in all, if you want to bring the younger kids ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
