There is a group of Fox TV leaders sitting around in a board table and wondering what's new to the commission. <br /> <br /> "What about aiming for something like 24 or The West Wing?" says one of them, but they all agree that it would be too expensive, and cheap TV is less likely to damage the station if it flops. <br /> <br /> "What about joining some great comedians and making a quality sitcom?" offers another and fired on site. "Don't you know, good writers cost a lot of money!" the big boss bends. "That's why we invented reality TV." <br /> <br /> "We could make another crime drama ..." suggests a man in a bland suit. "I listen ..." replies the boss, suddenly interested. "People like CSI, let's make another copy of it," adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> "But there are already too many CSI clones out there, what can we do to make us stand out?" a naive junior asks and is immediately dismissed. 'Stand out! If we do, people may be confused! Let's give them more of what they already like! 'The big boss screams. <br /> <br /> "Let's just add more violence and make it real pig, we are, after all, Fox", another suit suggests a hearty answer to "get it" from the big boss. "We could turn them into Deviant Crimes Unit," he continues adding, clearly on a roll. <br /> <br /> "By Jove he has it!" the big boss laughs, "and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on the screen." "Well, that would definitely distract people from the average actors and bad scripts," Blandman points out. <br /> <br /> "It's definitely we just need a name," the big boss says. "We could call it Sex Cops Violence?" <br /> <br /> For literally, what about the Killer Instinct? it conveys violence, but sounds a bit like the Basic Instinct, which had lots of sex. ' <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the major headlines and then they throw each other back and go and cancel Arrested Development.
