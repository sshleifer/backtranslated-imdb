Please help the economy - use your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the movie is: The First Lady has murdered her husband because he cheated on her. That is it. Without the discovery of anyone, except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a comprehensive breakdown of murder, as no one knows ... and comes away completely free. Some specific points are especially hilarious: As they stand in front of the president, Cuba deflects the bullet of the murder ... which then enters the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch movies from a news camera and they see ... a little. They go a long way to protecting the movie, believing that they are the only ones who have a copy of this very public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba speaks to a president. PSM notes that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that there was more than one person involved. PSM then ranks that conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. Gosh, I wonder PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, The First Lady, is a craptacular artist. Cuba can't make a painting, and she says, "You're too close ... standing back ... looking from a different perspective, looking from my perspective." Can anyone miss this clue?
