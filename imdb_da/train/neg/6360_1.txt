May I have my $ 13.00 back? I'd rather have seen "Hydro-Electric Power come to North America". Again. This is a movie with a voice. The same voice that comes out of each character's mouth regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again, I would have to charge at least $ 150 an hour. And I'm not taking insurance. It was scary to see Will Ferrell morph into Woody. But I don't think imaginative casting is enough. You have to wait until they have a story before they make a movie. Unless he just does it for the money. And if so, why not just reissue an All-Rap version of "What is Tiger Lily?"
