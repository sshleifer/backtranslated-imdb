First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in movies ... 2007 Comedies I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory 2007 Comedies I Hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned off "Hot Rod" after I arrived at approx. 20 minute mark. I knew at the time that this movie wouldn't make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to break 6 on IMDb. Anyone older than 10 years who has had this here must be a kind of mental defect. <br /> <br /> This doesn't come close to anything with Will Farrell, and it is clear that Andy Samberg can't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I don't know how to rouse Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this movie ... they must have favors or something. I came in and knew it would be a silly movie, but I thought it would be fun at least. I didn't do as much as smirk. I don't usually notice movies on IMDb, but it was so terrible I had to warn people. This is only the 4th movie I've seen, I've felt compelled to judge 1/10.
