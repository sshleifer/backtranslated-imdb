"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person, and his rather ugly life is quite well-documented. This film, which is intended to depict his life, should have used a fictitious character because the over-dramatized events are too strong a deviation from facts and chronology. Not only does it ignore some interesting details that other versions have included as public relations fiasco in upstate N.Y. and his religious conversion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky, et. eel. but it is as far as it goes. The exploding record scene, which represents Luciano, who performs Bo Weinberg's performance in his own home, is aided by his own mother, who is redirected. There is also the scene where Dutch is approaching her own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond. It just doesn't work. Mrs Fleggenheimer's character does not work either. This movie does not need a doting Jewish mother of comic relief. The lame representation of Legs Diamond was humorous enough. I'm sure the man turns in his grave. And by the way, Holland actually made people personally, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene where he dries out in the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it should be a comedy, and I just didn't get it.
