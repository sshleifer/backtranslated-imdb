This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit. It's set in the present, as we see a base in Afghanistan, being destroyed by a UAV right at the start. And that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark. UAV is not armed. They could be, but I don't think it's ever been tried for real. We are going to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to "hacker" Will Farmer (he is good at chemistry and electronics that does not make him a computer hacker) and his love interest, Annie) & Will's first attempt at hacking is not just a complete error his IP address is also logged and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet Will's mom who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills takes money from his neighbor bank account (Mr Massude) is not a hack (he helped him create the account), so we get a nod back to the original movie where they decide to play Global Thermonuclear War & they play The Dead Code. The track that the RIPLEY office is running is NOT on Will, but on Massude's PC, so all the evidence they gathered was useless to Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY shut Will's down machine is not explained (he only plays an online game?) and also why it felt the need to shut down all power throughout the block he lived in. Why a counter-terrorist agency would see this as a viable goal is highly questionable. What about RIPLEY, which activates its mobile phone? I do not think it was not connected to the PC and the message would not play unless he actually responded to the phone, so there is more bad "hacking" science there. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude's home, take him away & Will get an envelope that turns out to contain a lot of money. Wanting to search for the license plate of the car that took Massude is not a "hack" that you never see him breaking into the DMV computer. RIPLEY agents who take Dennis at the airport he is looking for. Has no authority to arrest or detain him. Will's mother had also not been "stealing chemicals and bio agents". And even though she did, they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada, as it is a completely different country with different laws for the United States. <br /> <br /> The computer has gone villain and all the actions it has taken Will, his mother and Dennis were not sanctioned by a government agency. The phone freak we see will make is the first show of any hacking skills in the movie, we also get a hack in RIPLEY, which seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> "The guy" who ran in Annie at the airport and also saw them on the street, there was nothing to do with RIPLEY & the ridiculous notion that RIPLEY could track a cell phone while the underground was so stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original movie when they mention Stephen Falken as designer of the RIPLEY system replaced, Joshua Project. We find that the "guy" who ran into Annie is the Falken (not played by the original actor badly) who falsified his own death. <br /> <br /> We also see WOPR as "what to help" they beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used then. The Falken & WOPR is destroyed too soon after they have almost not been used (the same explosion will kill Will, Annie & Russian. It is also unlikely that they would create an independent computer system that has the ability to nuclear or lose chemical weapons) The country it drives out of. <br /> <br /> The whole "decontamination" plot and idea is absolutely incredible, these kind of orders have to go through the president or the joint bosses, so another ridiculous and incredible idea. br /> <br /> The IP hackers against RIPLEY are not finished by Will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests and implements the idea. It is too much ridiculous that Will would get a login right from increasing RIPLEY's Operating Temperature After having Joshua as the back door to RIPLEY (especially after it was blown to bits) is an incredible cop-out and scream of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to finish this movie with. <br /> <br /> There is a terrible good, where RIPLE Y plays Dead Code and we see a countdown (say 17 minutes), then RIPLEY says "30 minutes decontamination", how crazy is it when they can't even stop their own hours? RIPLEY's attack mission against Philadelphia has stopped (too easily in my opinion) and it decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and redirects the missile directed at a Philly to Washington, where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange to get RIPLEY to realize what she is doing will not work (surely she already knew if she had Joshua insider as he had already learned this lesson in the original movie?) Is another nodding back to the original movie. <br /> <br /> Your cop-out to have RIPLEY repeat Joshua's exact same word constitutes the end of the original movie, just showing how many original ideas they couldn't bring. <br /> <br /> To point out bad and stolen ideas, men are guilty of Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is a horrible movie and is best avoided.
