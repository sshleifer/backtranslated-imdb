How hard is it to write a watchable movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently very difficult for the authors here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa Claus is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in reality it didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and constructed; The kind of "fun show scenes" that are drugs too far, where there is no sense of comedy. <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to "tear down" at the end, which would have been suitable if something leading up to that point had been worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I can see how some people like this OK, as many people will take some garbage they are fed, but I strongly urge to wait for DVD on this one. NOT worth $ 23,978 it takes to bring your family to movies these days.
