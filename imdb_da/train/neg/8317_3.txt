For a movie about a killer, it is surprisingly boring. Nothing happens much and even when things happen, they do not create any real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> The actor is good from the two leads, giving Cassetti a great performance that combines Succo's security and stupidity, but the rest of the throw also does what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that Succo as a true story is not interesting is not a unique character, he is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> Films of this kind usually try to generate excitement or empathy or indignation and this generates nothing except a sense of regret that you wasted your time watching it.
