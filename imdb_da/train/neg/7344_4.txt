This is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older, married lover after she becomes pregnant; she gets herself against him and his whole family through black magic ?? which disappointing she does not herself, but has someone else do for her. Good production values ​​for a Thai horror flick. But the bland script never generates excitement, the director approaches the material quite conventionally, and the final act loses viewer's sympathy for the victims by throwing logic into the winds. At one point, a character has a primary possibility of simply shooting the villain dead, and instead she stands up and runs away without gathering the gun. Bad writing ?? you blow in it! <br /> <br /> Some icky gore effects, including a truly tasteless sentimental fetal corps, and a guy who dies of having hundreds of live eels break out of his stomach. Only recommended for genre performers, who simply have to watch all horror films produced in Asia over the last 15 years.
