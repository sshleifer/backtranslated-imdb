Zombies revolt is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty far down the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick of making zombies after World War I, one of the members decides to use knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least in the first place. A love triangle complicates some of the story. <br /> <br /> This was really a dull movie with horrible plays that made it hard to tell who were zombies and who wasn't. The dialogue was a little better and the plot was incredible (not the zombie part of it, but parts related to the "romance"). And even though I'm not a student or expert in filmography, the camera's work didn't seem to help the movie either. <br /> <br /> While I've seen a few movies that are worse, it's unlikely to please anyone. It's bad and not in such a bad-it-it-is-good kind of way.
