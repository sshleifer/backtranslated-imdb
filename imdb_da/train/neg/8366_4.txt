'SherryBaby' is quite painful and sordid melodrama in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on a probe after a drug-related conviction and struggles to become clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to Win back love for her baby daughter who is taken care of by her brother's family. The only reason for the movie to be seen is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the entire movie on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, as history is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional weight is set in the wrong place. I kept asking myself the whole picture whether I should be sorry about the past and perhaps future drug abuse mother as an instructor and screenwriter, or about the innocent child in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaals play could not convince me that I do not care more about the child.
