"I work for a malicious company that makes industrial espionage in the future, and I start to get confused about who I really am, sh * # t! I have a headache and things go wobbly. Oh no here comes another near subliminal quick-cut noisy mounting of significant but cryptic images ... '<br /> <br /> I rented this movie because they get reviews that have all been favorable Why? Cypher is a cheap, derived, boring movie that lies in a poorly realized, gentle future, with wooden wires and a ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> An eerie sensation that something interesting could happen will enable you to see a series of increasingly stupid and convincing events before the filmmakers hit you face with an end that combines the farmer's worst with a Duran Duran video.It is painfully obvious that they have eclipsed the production using Dr. Who style improvised special effects to include a few good ones ( if a little Babylon 5) CGI set pieces. This Sub Fight Club, sub Philip K Dick's future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than the modest budget will allow. Cool blue mood served with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly stupid. This is not intelligent Sci-Fi, this is a computer game.
