Unless you are twelve, this movie is not really worth it. It is, of course, a low-budget movie with B-players, and with a genre as a fantasy, which sometimes requires intense CGI work that is not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I enjoy laughing with bad movies. However, I didn't know that badly. It is tolerable until after hour 2, it really starts to burn. Fighting styles go between normal battles that obey the laws and physics of physics. There is no real explanation for the transition. It has a plot, but of course it's a child's movie. It looks like there are explicit moral lessons from the day being conveyed as Sesame Street or something. It's tolerable. But much better if you say nine.
