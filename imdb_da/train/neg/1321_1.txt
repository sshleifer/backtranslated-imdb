Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20 second comedies, and what does Gene Barry do all over the film? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that doesn't make sense. The monstrous writer / instructor (same guy) opened up everyone's talent with his terrible uh ... work. I got the DVD for a penny so I can't complain! But it's weird! And it makes you feel nice and not in a good way. This was the 70s and looked like the director was on a bad acid trip and wished everyone was experiencing what it was like to be inside his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but as a scratched recording, it quickly fails. It has the "Manson Family on Acid" vibe to it. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything they did out of this movie? Maybe they worked in it back when? At least be prepared to lose 80 + min. Of your life, you will never come back. Yes, it's so terrible!
