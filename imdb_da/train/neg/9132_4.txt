Dr. Fu Manchu's square plot with Peter Sellers in the spear of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice at the end of Sellers' career. The reason was very simplified, and if it was done, the right way could have been handled nicely, but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reason why this movie was not so good was the poor dialogue, cheap laugh, choppy rule and an awkward feeling that the movie was something incomplete. On the other hand, it was really the only thing that kept my interest under this mixed picture. I found Sellers' portrayal of diabolical manchu excellently done, with occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused, which henchman is, as he says, "Ah, you see everyone the same to me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed out loud with that line. <br /> <br /> Of course, a fistful of strong supportive characters caught me much like Helen Mirren as backstabbing constable, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film too, not a way to end a career), and Sid Ceasar (which gives a rather moody performance of Al Capone's relative working for the FBI). These characters also kept me in mind. <br /> <br /> The sets were also good. Oriental design and English community in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my advice to you is to watch the movie if you are Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you are better equipped to chew aluminum foil.
