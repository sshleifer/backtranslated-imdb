I was just sitting here at GenCon because it was quiet and I could nip. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Cat? WTF? Was the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something? <br /> <br /> Really a piece of unfunny waste. The characters were stereotypical without meaning (I think ...) and wood, most seemed to be as if they were on autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so choppy that I cried to the authors. <br /> <br /> I am confused about how anyone can find this worth their time, seriously. I only give 3 out of 10 because to be 2 or 1, it must be five hours long or have more Kelly LeBrock.
