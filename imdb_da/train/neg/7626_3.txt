After hearing raves about this movie for years I finally decided to rent it and see. Let me start by saying that I am happy that the rent was free from the local library. This movement was slow, dull, unrealistic, and the plot had no meaning. After 2 hours I was ready to nuke that backwater Texas city and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just don't understand all the hype I've heard about this movie. Dallas gave such a detail of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how film studios can pay enough money for reviewers to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
