So I got hold of this as a task for Trent Harris, who occasionally learns in the film dept of U's U. <br /> <br /> The documentary section initially dragged on. Yes, the child is an emergency job from no where, but it is not good enough to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> Seing Sean Penn dressed as ONJ is the only highlight ... and after approx. 30 seconds it loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover goes to Larry, storytelling was better, but I just couldn't take more ...
