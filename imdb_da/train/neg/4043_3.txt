The film begins with promise, but goes too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We are left hanging, but with nothing else we save relaxed shots of grave and thoughtful male faces to enjoy. Certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over. It's a shame because the concept is not without profit. We wonder why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so alienated from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond any notion. This loss of presence in the real world is, all too obvious and unnecessary, in contrast to the fact that the son has attracted the armed forces. Why not the circus so we can at least appreciate some color? We are left with a gnawing sense of loss, but unfortunately no enlightenment that is confusing given the film is apparently a form of achievement that is not available to all of us.
