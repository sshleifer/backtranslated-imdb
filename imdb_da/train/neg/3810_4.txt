When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLANK !!! This show is sappy, poorly written and rarely fun. The three leaders were all good actors and funny men (Sags stand up was much better than the things this show came up with, as Coulier was better, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted out of the show because it wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was eventually canceled, as many of the players demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are a few things that make me crazy for the show: <br /> <br /> 1. The catch phrases - How many times can a person put up with tiring catch phrases as with 'so rude' , 'you have that guy', 'nerd bombs', 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24-hour period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. It depicted and clipped as an oreo cookie. There is good kliched writing and bad cliched writing. Full House had bad cliched writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco - probably said. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic Things - Too Much to Remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy kids - The girls had all the latest mall fashion and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be in. Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about those involved, as I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just so sweet, I couldn't stand it for a while.
