I rented this movie from the library (it's hard to find for good reason) just out of curiosity. I'm a great Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is terrible, not because it originates from the original novel text, but because it strays without focus or intention. The scenes are poorly constructed and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What about the hokey voice over Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry was completely abused. Marilyn Hassett is absolutely amazing as Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old for that matter) partly because of casting (she was 32 during the film, age Plath was when she died) and partly because she could not act. Hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. The direction is mediocre; The director simply covers what is there, which is not much. The only reason I give the movie a 1 is because 0 is not an option. Excuse me, Sylvia, you have to wait for someone else to adjust your fine work to something more appropriate.
