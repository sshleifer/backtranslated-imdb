Poor Robert Englund is making another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes pretty good horror movies, but he did not manage to do so badly. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade, which was absorbed in the 18th century for its occupation of pain and the joy of bringing pain on itself as well as seeing others also be in pain. The story is so confusing with flipflop from one century to another, and I was confused with what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. All I saw was a young lady trapped by a strange lesbian who wanted to keep her to herself, and the young lady was fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and found out he was out to get her killed and then Englund enters from a century to another who claims to be the descendant of the Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of Mum Momoselle (spelled wrong) or who it was in the picture of the Sades wall. The movie was horrible, I'm surprised by Hooper to hire Englund in this movie, and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially the part about the eyes. Englund is trying to make a comeback from his once hit movement "Nightmare on Elm St." by using these moves in and out needles to lay people's eyes. Terrible, absolutely horrible.
