Okay, during this last Thanksgiving holiday, everyone decided to take a movie, and when the Fred clause was voted as a majority, that is what we went and said. <br /> <br /> To start the movie, so many plot holes were pathetic. Simple explanations of why a particular event happened were invalid. example; who the hell is trying to 'close' the Christmas clause? Is it a kind of business? A little explanation would have been lovely. <br /> <br /> Other: The movie threw you spanked characters that didn't express sympathy for you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in eleven villages. they see each other twice, and then they are a couple, and I could care less because this movie did not care for me. <br /> <br /> Third: I suppose this was supposed to be a family movie? Its rating was low with only PG. For a family movie, there were several articles of suggestive conversation. It didn't bother me, but if I was a parent, I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti watched extremely sadly, but honestly he was the only one worth seeing in the movie. Vaughn had a few fun moments, but played the same character he has for the last two films. cheerful frat boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he has been good at other movies) <br /> <br /> So this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me just because someone had to try to produce, film and release that flick. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would certainly pass this flick on or if you should see it save it for a rainy day rental.
