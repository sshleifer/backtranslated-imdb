History of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starting out with an opening scene that is a great example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is transformed into an insane, violent mob by its singer's crazy songs. Unfortunately, the absurd remains ALL of the time without general narration, and it eventually does so. Even those from the era must be off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third degree. On a technical level, it is better than you might think with a good movie at future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
