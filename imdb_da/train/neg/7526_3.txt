This is high quality cheese fare for B movie kung fu flicks. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let's show Bruce's quick clips and make close-ups of his eyes, and if you quint at the right time for a certain time of day in the winter solstice, it looks a bit like Bruce. You will laugh at the fact that the movie's splicing is not very good, but some cool deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this can apologize to Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, although his character must be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimes Bruce's gesture and fighting style - very bad). See Bruce go one-on-one with the swept lion. The props department stopped by Kay-Bee you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with savage beating a curly man. Towards the end, the director decided "let's throw a flashback" for a scene that was only shown 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only single-celled organisms with attention disorder can fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
