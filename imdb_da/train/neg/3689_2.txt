The main aspect of Superstar's film in his later stages was the frequency, the lacuna between a movie and the next. Being a well-established star in the southern Indian cinema, the feedback he received before Baba was great. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he performed in Tamil as a mass hero of 11 years was only 11 exactly at a rate of 1 per. year. All of these were a good hit. He had a picture that many thought could not easily be reduced. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he entered a state of sleep. His fans all over the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch movies of any kind with their superstar in action. Then the Tamil cinema industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers thought fans would take what they show with Superstar in it. But this movie didn't seem clear. As usual, the hype from the media and the expectations of the fans was far beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> Rajinikanth's picture was totally damaged. The fans went nuts. The film's collection did not meet the expected level. The reputation of great people went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this movie was the songs of A.Rehman. Rehman is known for composing good music for some of the worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, A Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. Well, I never thought this movie would join the league. <Br /> <br /> You feel very depressed, not because the movie was bad, that's because the superstar's image goes down. It took him five full years to regain it all back with two movies Chandramukhi and Sivaji and give fans back what they really are looking for in a superstar movie.
