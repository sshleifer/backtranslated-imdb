If you watch this movie, you will be angry with the cinema, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, to put your name and face to this bad excuse for a movie. It may have been more daunting if the Japanese actors would have just spoken in Japanese instead of trying to 'act' in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... a real disappointment after all the hype on TV and movie trailers that promote this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie ... she just practiced her perks. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
