I see people writing about how big this movie was. It was awful! The action was at best under-par. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did it get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank what ran through the minds of many people; maybe even a little conspiracy thing. Does anyone realize that some people didn't even control the ship because there was a fire on board before it even went off? No, you don't, because all you see is a rich girl who falls for a poor boy, and he paints her naked (has the corny junk at least told you the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> I was crying during a scene. The play when they showed the water filling up the ship. It looked like pool water! I think this movie made all this money and couldn't even get the water from the sea to look right? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played while the ship sank. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor surpassed the "Nothing to do with reality" section.
