Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. While part two was filled with much dated humor and cheap shots, it was at least fun. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Witnesses, pratfalls and sight gags must of course be fun. Turning the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. The mood of this movie is aimed at young imbeciles who want to laugh at something. When considering the junior high school crowd, any sense of self-respect was thrown out of the window. Ring parodies are not fun. I've seen them in comedies since 1998. They are so dated. Michael Jackson jokes aren't cool either. What's even worse is making fun of two crashes has been "performers" whose best days were never. <br /> <br /> The American bio's death has been slow. Movies like this are the seams that are tied in the coffin. What happened to real humor? I haven't learned a lot in a movie theater for a long time. Too many bad movies rotate the brain. Do you want proof? Go to your local mega-chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe the hype. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than suffering through this bad excuse for a comedy ever again! Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
