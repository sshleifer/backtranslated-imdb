A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange sound and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling through their picnic rug. He wants to go for a walk in a hole that has something to do with some work he does, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on the trip, but let the group come out. She falls down a slope where she is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again and seems to know that a bat is approaching; you do and get in your hair. He fights it from her and it attacks him and bites his forehead. <br /> <br /> They come out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he begins to have seizures where he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He gets angry when it happens. He can't drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife cares for rabies and he starts a Pasteur treatment for it, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are killed. We see parts of man's transformation into a bat person. It looks like it's not just in his mind. Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear as he already had some symptoms before praying. While the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing happens to another person. Not a great movie, but I liked the variety of the desert, the cave and the ski slope, and some of the weather scene. I didn't think it was as bad as other people do, and I didn't think the 1999 movie films were as bad as others also think (I rated one a 5/10).
