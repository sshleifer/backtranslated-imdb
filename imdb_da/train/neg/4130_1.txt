A top contender for worst movies ever made. Joanna Pakula character seems to have an I.Q. of 3, which is only a minor than author and director. The play would not have passed in a high school; The "jokes" are the young concept of corny. Of course, these artists were desperate for work. I only got to the end to see if it would get worse. It did. Life is too short to spend any part of what sees this movie.
