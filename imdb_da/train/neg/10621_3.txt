I will not add to the plot reviews, it is not very good. <br /> <br /> Very unlikely orphanage at Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br /> Some great scenes. <br /> <br /> Good for facial spotting, and I quote, "Look at the mouth, it's Cassie from Fools and Horses". Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry is. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at something else, and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Redeeming feature? It was free to watch the Horror channel before it switched to subscription. I do not want to subscribe to this effort.
