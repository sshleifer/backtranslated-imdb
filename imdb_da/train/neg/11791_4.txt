I don't get this. Of course, the film has a pretty good budget. It has very good filmography. It has good pacing, good editing and pretty good direction as well. So why WHY haven't they recruited someone to make a final rewrite of the manuscript, so it wouldn't be so amazing cheesy and why did they work so miserable actors who can't get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. In most cases, it looks good and feels good, but in the end you realize that the movie was not good. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's a good production, but a bad movie. Too bad indeed. <br /> <br /> Eel? Come one, really!
