Just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it is absolutely fantastic that this poorly written waste lasted for a full eight years. I'm sure most of the people who saw this unpleasant shit were in their sixties and seventies and just stopped because they had nothing better to do or just remembered their star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, was never much of an actor (by his own admission) and he was already too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks quite old as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. His talented real life son Barry, a wood actor who has rarely been in something that did not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
