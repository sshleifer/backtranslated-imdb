Working on a video store I get to see a couple of movies and sometimes I try to see some of the not so big movies. Proudly happened to be one of them. The first idea of ​​telling the story of a primary crew ship during World War II had some profit. But in less than 10 minutes watching the movie, you find out that the film's primary point was to tell about racial tension in World War II. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point is hammered on you to the point where everything is everywhere in the movie. I command the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in adversity and adversity for the tribulations they endured. A movie should have been made focusing on the results these men did for themselves, Navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is World War II racism.
