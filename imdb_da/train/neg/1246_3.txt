Spoilers I guess. <br /> <br /> The absolute absurd logic at the end destroys the entire movie. I just couldn't get over it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly found myself crashing on a planet full of talking monkeys, I would be like: "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! Run for your life! The monkeys have inherited the earth!" But he is like, "monkeys speak, okay. Next?" It's pretty sad I want to say. He must regularly run into even foreign things. Moreover, this is Rick Baker's best work yet. This film is a true testament to how far we have come in the monkey makeup field. 10.3.
