We are not in the naked emperor's adventure. We can admit the truth of what we see without being stupid, recognizing that this show is incomprehensible in many aspects, and that much of it was created by pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> Well, of course, many people like such things. I dont do that. I prefer well thought out and planned shows. And I also admit that the show is very serious for my taste and boring ... the love and substance stories ... There are so many exciting soaps with great excitement (Dallas Oak), but Twin Peaks can't catch my attention. I don't care about these people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
