First, I would like to apologize for my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL hardcore fan, but I liked that movie. Live Feed, however SUGGET BIG TIME! I have never seen a gore movie with great plays, but hey, who's surprised? The action in Live Feed was ... yes, not there! I have seen some commented on this as it must have been a school project or something. Okay, but not by students in media or schools. This was no class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off at the Hostel. And what about gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that would twist your gut and leave you cold? It was the most disappointing hole movie! Short, fast and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okay, there where the buckets of blood, but it didn't even look real. The slaughter and violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw films. And Braindead was fun! Okay, I laughed at Live Feed a few times, but it was more disappointed than out of pure fun! <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting 80 minutes watching Live Feed, see Something else!
