This movie is a farce! Names are roughly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and crushed into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gallows to give Beowulf a ridiculous gun / armband weapon. Beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that! In the poem he shakes Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can't believe the scriptwriters did such a thing. The way Grendel is portrayed, however, is impressive. The and the cast are the only positive points in the function. My English teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the epic poem "Beowulf," avoid this movie at all costs. And even then I wouldn't recommend it.
