A story of fantastic disinterest kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (like Fulci is angry camera work, which is usually a releasing factor in his movie), and any understanding of excitement is nowhere to be found. It is padded out to an insufficient degree - in the end you will not cluster with excitement but suffered from boredom (and like me, perhaps an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie. Fulci gorehounds beware - there just isn't much going on in "The Psychic." <br /> <br /> 3/10
