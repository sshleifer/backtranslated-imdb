'Ninten Ottogfyrre' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can trust. It's a very dark movie and it's one that doesn't make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance that takes place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and on the human nature is self-centered. The film has some very good ideas and is good at portraying this society with the dark tones of color (as opposed to happiness and bright colors of the dreams) and a general sense of loneliness through objects and people and places. Despite the film's wisdom by depicting this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to get the idea across. It seemed to spend too much time being smart instead of telling a story.
