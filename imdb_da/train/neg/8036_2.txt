Do you want a secret? This movie sucks. Actually, I don't know, because if you allow yourself to be enchanted by plagiarized versions of original movies, then you might find this movie amazing (this movie is a plagiarized copy of I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie are based on a typical story setting; A bunch of so-called cool teens revive their vacation in Florida and are themselves behaving much like the young ones they are. The only insight we get at this time is the extent to which the director managed to illustrate a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the movie is gaining momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the non-near-unseen killings. The third half hour of the movie will surely remain a mystery to me because I knocked it off before I could immerse myself in thinking that the movie might still have something interesting and original to show. As far as history is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. A bunch of teenagers going to Florida on vacation. While they are busy partying, they slowly (and I think LONG) begin to be killed because they know a kind of stupid secret. The only thread for the killings is that all victims were matriculates by a common high school. One thing, however, that surprised me about this movie was how much betty (I'm not sure her name ... the blonde character) resembles reese slippers. Another thing that surprised me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a couple of times. Does it make it a work of art? definitely not because my 12 year old niece made me lose a glass of orange juice because she "boo'ed" me as i was just going through the guest door. What is the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece ???? <br /> <br /> Want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure about you, but I don't.
