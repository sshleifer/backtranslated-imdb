If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I just want to know where the money went. A monkey could do better CGI effects, so what was wasted for 3 hours on this terrible piece of waste, even though I have to admit the machines and the martyrs would have looked really cool on an original play style 1 game and early PC games from mid 90s if a game had ever been made. What puzzles do I have, where did the money go? Pendragon movies could have made a good movie with good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras la George Lucas around 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they care about what they do (or destroy in this case) for about the same 20 million. This is possibly the worst movie ever made! I'd rather sit through a 24-hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this movie again. I completely hated it! I regress. I say it is the WORST movie ever made because, unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus, the Martians are capturing the movie that is so bad that you have a special place in your heart For those you love them. There is no love for this movie and no space in my DVD library for that. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I bet the money that the movie was used for splashes and other vices for cast and crew. Shame on you Pendragon movie! I want my money back!
