Without the effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivational shades of humanity, all this creative team has hoped that the effective use of its middle, unoriginal elements is effective. The 'Party of Five' has gone maniacal and then genetically inevitable, there is little interest in the riders, because the singular non-homicidal element is another betting awful acting 'Wes Bentley' mopester. In fact, all the actors are deep. Although the dark-haired women appeal, salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Sufficient buckets of blood are also missing. All sensations are kept at a fair and safe distance ... an unfortunate fact given the director's name is butcher. Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty alt-land and the tense fluctuating score give any palpable excitement. Sometimes, static storyboarded compositions add appealing low angles that add to the inconvenience ... but for a movie that calls itself horror, I didn't even come close to flinching once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes aimed at varying geometric shapes outside the square and a persistent focus on playtime through the family's malevolence or trapping sympathetic signs need to escape to avoid their dilemma would have improved my mind but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest.
