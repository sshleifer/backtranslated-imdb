How to do it: Believe in God and repent for your sins. So things must turn around within the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie just plays like a bad mention of a drunk crappy life. His mother dies. His stepmom is a b_tch. His father dies. He is drinking. He gets married. He has kids He drinks something more. His wife gets angry. He disappointed his children. Wife threatens to leave. He calls for a bold late night b / c he wants to kill himself. So after the restoration, it happens when we get the "Left Bag" -like subtle message. <br /> <br /> "He needed a paycheck". This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over as credits started rolling, so I wouldn't lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen drops to his knees and asks for the forgiveness of Christ. When he does, he goes outside and actually says he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he has found God, and that is good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. Finish the movie that Madsen goes to the bar and give a solo silo about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. The last minute? He gives a small repulsive wave to the bar (that is, his house) and gives homosexuals, Miami-Vice, a post-school special congratulation fight in the air as the camera's freezing frames. See why I had to repeat the sentence? "He needed a paycheck". <br /> <br /> Man this movie is bad. B-Grade 80's production values ​​do not help much. The script could easily have been a "Touched By An Angel" episode. It could have been knocked out for 30 minutes plus advertisements. The action is wood and never credible. Even Madsen, of which I am a big fan and is the only reason I put this through, makes it clear that this is his first play, and he does not yet know his $$ from his elbow on camera. 45 minutes into it, I began to become discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it off and say it ok, I saw half of it. It is good enough. But no. If I sat through Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit on this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Introduction to Michael Madsen". Suffer me. 2) Part of the dialogue is so poor that it is classic. I keep some quotes at the end of this so you can also enjoy them. <br /> <br /> It's about it. To unpack it, this thing is a piece of shit that has to be flushed with the rest of the bulls. But hey! See! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER, etc.). Now I have to rewatch Reservoir Dogs and see Madsen torture a policeman to get my respect back for him. Look, the kids. <br /> <br /> "This is going to make me blind, but I'll probably drink it" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I don't understand! seems so beautiful! - Madsen goes outside after confessing to God. "I go downtown later and get a Bible and I also get a haircut." - Madsen after conversion at the dining table because Satan lives in your hair
