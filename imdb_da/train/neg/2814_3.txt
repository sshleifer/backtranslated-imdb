1. Looked at 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary but sadistic (as sensible) depiction of a Marquis De Sade's relative performs the same sadistic actions and enjoys what allegedly made his predecessor . This Tobe Hooper movie does not do much differently from his similar style Freddy Krueger movie with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) plays a dual role (Marquis De Sade and his family). It also looks like it will really poke on Christianity, but eventually it loses much to my destiny, but leaves an inconsistent feeling of the movie. Could have been much worse if abuses were committed in sex and violence, but they are trying to keep this on a minimal despite some obnoxious scenes. My last thought is why would Hooper like to make this movie. Of course, it took a while to actually distribute so it should be announced horribly and with Hooper's name in the title hopefully to make some money on his name and his dealings. It's obvious it didn't work.
