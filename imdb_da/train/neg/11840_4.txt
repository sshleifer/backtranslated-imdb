Everything that might have been interesting in this material is immersed in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we are seeing are never known and "This is the whisper [rumors] most often told" about one of Hollywood's most sensational "mysteries". <br /> <br /> Okay. So we get nothing new (and E! S "Mysteries & Scandals" gives you a better foothold on that incident ... and it's not much of an endorsement). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper and decadents. No big news there. More interestingly, we learn what a rinsed director is willing to do to regain his power position in the entertainment industry and / or political establishment. It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks from his own experience through these characters. But what is said is so cynical and ugly and confused that we are guilty of seeing a bunch of hooey passing by himself as a story. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie has a curious foodcap quality that I found more annoying than fun. We are not empathetic with anyone. And the great "Citizen Kane" polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a far more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow" we are not sure of Davie's motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we are told one thing, she is unable to do the other. <br /> <br /> And should we believe Davies was the love of Chaplin's life? Or is he just trying to cockold one of America's most powerful - and apparently moronic - citizens. The film never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is the production values. There is a glorious recreation of yacht and period costumes. I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the best-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the manuscript is pure fiction. The disclaimers that hit the movie make it only more preventative and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Performers can't be interrupted even though Meg Tilly goes a long way past parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​scenery. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole company rather than telling it. One of her first lines is, "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wants her not to. <br /> <br /> This is not on par with Bogdanovich's sweet, so bad-it's-good "At Long Last Love." It is keen to try something serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is so bitter against the "animal" called Hollywood. This is the "National Enquirer" movie creation. And it not only supports the names of those who place the film aboard Oneida this weekend, but the audience is also quite dirty.
