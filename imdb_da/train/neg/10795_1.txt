Will anyone tell Shaq to stick to what he's good at basketball. This movie was not even entertaining at a stupid level. In this movie, Shaq plays a genius who lives in a boom box, it is not an original genius in a boom box instead of a lamp. He's going to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra. This movie had the most slick history since the water world, the play was terrible, and I think anyone who likes this flame would be afraid to admit it.
