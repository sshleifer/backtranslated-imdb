Speaking like a sand-cooked unpaved gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never confuses this movie with The Godfather I or II or Goodfellas. It's not in the same league. But what makes the movie periodically painful to see is all these Italian Americans swearing about losing bad gangsta lines in an even worse false unseen. Pacino would have been great if they could just have called him. I was looking forward to seeing Abrahams and Loggia, but their stone accents spoiled fun. <br /> <br /> Oh, the script isn't too hot. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and clapping his back all the time.
