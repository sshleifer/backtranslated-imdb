** CONTAINING SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The truly exquisite Sean Young (who in some scenes, with her hair polish, looks something like Elizabeth Taylor) is striking in her opening moments in this movie. Sitting behind a police car waiting to signal a bust, face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, when the chest is over, Young's strained behavior has never changed. This is a badly inhibited actress. <br /> <br /> You just have to compare Young to the executive player who plays his colleague and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what is lacking in Young. Walker is open, emotional and calm at all times ... as there is no apparent barrier between what she can feel and her expression of it. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts in the dirty, self-conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act when they were suddenly thrown into the lead role in a movie. Basically, she doesn't have a clue. <br /> <br /> With this huge gap threatening in the middle of the movie, we are back to considering the inconveniences of history. For example, after Miss Young has been kidnapped by the criminal she is dragging and locked in a closet, she breaks down the door when it is alone. Granted, she is only dressed in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psychophanger due to return a moment, you would go to the door ... or take the time to go through her dresser, roof some clothes and dress up? I guess this and other scenes are trying to suggest some kind of mixed feelings Miss Young's character is experiencing, but Young can't convey this kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are a few affecting moments in the movie, such as the brief police interviews with the criminals' criminals, but generally it is a pointless attempt. It's wrong Miss Young was replaced while filming the couple of comic book movies that could have exploited their limitations with some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her floundering while trying to play real people is strangely touching. Watching Miss Young try to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad play.
