This reboot is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but very underrated 2003 "The Incredible Hulk". <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a cartoon movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes a little time to look out (about 40 minutes), but when he sees the conflict in the main character's core. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits when he gives up his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compares this with Edward Norton's turn where there is no conflict view in his personality and he becomes Hulk when he gets excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute. minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this reviewer, this felt in connection with the introduction of midi-chlorians in Phantom Menace, which tells how strong the "force" is with one, as if mysterious abilities can be measured through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to keep his heart rate below 200, as monitored by a device attached to his wrist. And for the record it is extremely difficult to get a pulse of up to 200 even through a very exciting race, especially for a physically fit person. Emotions run Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed reminiscent of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but underneath there is considerable anger, enough rage to burn the Hulk when it loosens. But Hulk never deliberately kills even his attackers. For the most part, he will just get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He disqualifies his shooters and in a critical scene saves a fighter, pursuing him from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as needed. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are needed for the plot, as opposed to the 2008 movie, where action has been taken for action. <br /> <br /> In her quest to make it a "fleeting" story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. For him, Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment that went wrong. And Louis Leterrier, the director who records Ed Norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summed up as: Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks ass, Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as needed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it may not be as true in the comics as the 2008 version. But even though I am a fan of the comics, I prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy dream, but has the heart of the comic book loyal but produced and rarely 2008 version any day. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Ang Lee should have read several comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and has a heart.
