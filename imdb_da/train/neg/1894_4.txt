Although there is Flying Guillotine as part of the title of this movie, it has no links to the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its successor Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of kung-fu film and still appear as a classic. This is a much inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular Kung Fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie doesn't have much play. It's a meaningless battle scene after another, and flying guillotine doesn't even play a big part in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who track down some villains who have gone off with a holy book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them. <br /> <br /> There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of their title. This, in my opinion, is of the least quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three, suggesting that this film was produced by another entity from the other three. The film has no chemistry except to be accidental fun due to poor production. <br /> <br /> Best jump over this and see the two originals.
