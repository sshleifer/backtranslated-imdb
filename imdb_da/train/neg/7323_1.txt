Well ....... unlike other comments previously written, I have to say that the only good thing about this movie is that a guy in it looks a little like Jason Donavon who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how it won any awards, and although I am sure a lot of effort was made to do so, it was fruitless, as the final result is a scream of 90-year-old foreign soap operas. The reason was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the play was on par with an a-level performance. Unfortunately it was a long time and the subplots were incredibly unrealistic .... for example .... if your best friend slept with your ex girlfriend for 6 years after only 2 weeks of breaking up, you wouldn't stay the best of friends. It was all imagination. That's all! Oh yes, and the strange 90's house / soft core indie was insane!
