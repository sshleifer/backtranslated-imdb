Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to the woman from the TV station - is right: LAPD IS a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie does not change anything about it. Okay, here's the good police, the moral police, even a black, whow, a Christian, a martyr. But this is an adventure, admit it. The reality is not that. And most importantly for action fans: The shoot is boring. Just shoot and shoot and shoot. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, and at least you will have something to do. The only moral of this movie is: The LAPD is good now. No more bad police in it. If you like uncritical, euphemistic advertising for the police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
