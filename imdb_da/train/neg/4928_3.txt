This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its time. A wealthy female female women's scheme, draws and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to start secret activities of a certain anti-social nature. There is a smart sex-roll conversely, as her activities turn out to be more bold and dashing than most of the male characters. But of course there is a tall, dark and beautiful stranger to maintain the love interest, and this evil lady is not behind to come forward when she meets the right man. The wishy-washy weakness and credibility of all other characters makes the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who crave romance will overlook it.
