When this movie was released, I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had greatly expected the long-distance production of a movie of the story. My wife and I were in the queue hours before the box office was opened the day the movie was released. It wasn't just a disappointment, it was a kick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First, the story was "moved outside", so to speak, by including scenes that were not in the theater's context. These limitations are a major part of history's importance and impact. <br /> <br /> Second and Third Together (assign your own order): One of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song that was not in stage production was added. What do you say ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talented and hard work of the artists. I have seen Chorus Line on stage six times, and would not mind seeing it 6 times before I die. It is wonderfully written, with wonderful music and heartbreaking true stories. If you want to see a musical that contains a large "cattle call" audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of a chorus line, see it on stage.
