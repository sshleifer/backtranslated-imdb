Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a once military man who has retired to a teacher's job. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides to hang it up. Things get dicey when you look over a bunch of students in detention, some robbers take over the school as an operating base for a hooded car robbery. Its Dolph vs. Baddies in a fight to death. The jawbone throws back to the exploitation films of the late Grindhouse era, where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had glow hairs today. What a silly movie. Watchable in one I can't believe people have done this kind of way, it's an action movie that was probably doomed to come before the low budget, fake breakaway sets and bad action direction were even a glimpse into a producer's eye. See how late in the movie cars drive through the school (don't ask) they crash into the security tower (don't ask when it looks like a prison and a high school) and smash their barely constructed form apart (it doesn't look like that did in previous shots). What have the gods of the deities done? In fact, I was confused when this was instructed (?) By Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made movies like The Boys in Company C. Has his ability failed him or was it hopelessly on the move and he did not disturb yourself? It's a turkey. A clear one, but a turkey anyway.
