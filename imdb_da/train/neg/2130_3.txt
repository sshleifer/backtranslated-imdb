I think I'll be late for the party. I just watched this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to watch the 1963 movie version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and I'm thinking of making an amateur production of show because I remembered it as so fun to do. I was not impressed with this newer version. It just wasn't enough fun. It wasn't colorful. It lacked the abundance of youth. The lighting was poor. No one seemed to mention this fact. This is not a moody musical, it is bright and up beat. The lighting decision was a poorly creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of error. I have no opinion on this in this version. The lighting was terrible and it killed the overall performances. The dance speech also appeared to be anemic. We have music videos this day. At least, the dance tales should have measured up to some of the best of them, or what about some of the best of Broadway. The choreographer slept in the wheel as it seemed. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were extremely talented, there were some really bad choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin artists out there, it would not have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African-American, lovely and talented, but poorly cast. Jason Alexander's effort was amazing, he always does intelligent work, but he just wasn't Albert. He was miscast, and I think it's obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The medium of film is not the medium of the scene. It must be translated from one medium to another. The extermination and flash of stage music must be translated into movies. There is no profit to be true to a stage script when it is filmed. The spirit, the essence of production must be produced. For me, the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively, while production in 1995 was as gloomy as the lighting and as weak as the dance numbers. It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many truly talented people.
