Not a movie, but a lip-synchronized collection of performances from actions that were part of the British invasion following the Beatles' dynamic entry into the music world. Some of these actions did not make a big sideboard on this side of the pond, but many of them did so. Featured are: Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and of course the Beatles. It is so much fun to see these young acts before they beat and polish their actions.
