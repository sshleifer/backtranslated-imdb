I agree with all the above that said something that would convince you not to waste even the shortest time watching this amazing amateur movie. Very bad actions, off-line production values, complete pedestrian direction, and a script as incomplete and imposing, it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" seem to be working just for a paycheck, though no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have endorsed this inappropriate drive. OTH, there is something fascinating about seeing something so stupidly bad. And Chad Lowe is amazing and consistently poor.
