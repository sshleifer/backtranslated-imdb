In fact, I prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (eg, Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World according to Garp). This is my favorite Robin Williams movie. But Seize Day, although well-acted, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> Every good story should have its ups and downs. However, this movie is a huge down. I don't need a sensitive Hollywood cheese party, but I need something other than 90 minutes of complete and complete hopelessness. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point in the movie is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? So what.
