What a shaky piece of rubbish !!! Who are all those people who blubber about how good this is? Yes, it is "artificial"; And yes it is "foreign", but .... it is not enough. The plot is dull and uneven, like a reality show, but not so beautifully done. <br /> <br /> The people are inherently uninteresting; but as a sign, they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, I feel very, very sad. <br /> <br /> The violence (and some of it is very violent) seems quite incredible and free. It is as the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino. Not what I think much about either. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: If I had neighbors like these, I'd move!
