Barry, a medical transcriptionist, has the point of corroding from his job combined with the remembrance of a violent upbringing in the hands of his maid, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spirals into madness and finally a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a bald dumb guy) struggle for control of his soul. This movie is undone by some bad actors and unintentional humorous scenes. Not to say it is terrible or anything, just what you call it is known only as it is because of Bruce Campbell's healthy fan base (as I am one) who is likely to see something he is involved in or involved with in some way. <br /> <br /> My character: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second comment from Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport; "Hating every minute" a 17-minute documentary; deleted and expanded scenes; alternatively take; outtakes, recordings of world premiere; Poster and still gallery; Talent bios; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM: .PDF format manuscript <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: Highlight the eyes for a ridiculous look (left eye) and one minute of nothing but one actual easter eggs (right eye)
