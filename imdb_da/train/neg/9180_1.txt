Okay, let me start by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who has read the other comments. That said, ME G-D, THIS MOVIE REEKED! I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they did of course and still get worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman was probably moving this movie at some point but fell due to the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie was made in the first place is that someone said, "Hello, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get that have zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, one someone else first came there. Quiet hill? No, too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared stupid. Hello, Sega has not had a game where people ran around shooting zombies? They are out of the platform biz we could get it for pennies! "Basically, they tried best to make a movie that felt like video games, even down to shoot the game as if characters actually played the game. <br /> <br /> The first and greatest problem is that the original game was terrible. I mean, <br /> <br /> bad-movie-merchandising-made-to-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shipp d-out -and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid.The graphics were boring.The monsters were boring.The levels were boring.The interface was boring.CASE was boring. In other words, a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you didn't get a shotgun to hold your hand while you were upset by the stupid thing about this pointless game! But I go down. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercede scenes from the actual gameplay during battle scenes. HUH ??? Does the editor not have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual battle in progress? Not to mention that each game was shot from a video game, which may explain the dull use of matrix effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first person shooter (the player goes out of the character POV). Maybe that's why they put the game into the graphics to tell you that they highlighted the game ... Whatever ... <br /> <br /> Whatever it was, the only thing that made this whole experience extremely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theater made it fun with the movie so that my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general adultery were taken as ordinary and did not kick me out. <br /> <br /> To the sum up, don't watch this movie! Don't even count on renting it when it comes out in video in a few weeks. Race. Just drive.
