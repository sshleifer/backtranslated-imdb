Oh my God. This was a really big mess that just couldn't help itself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and doesn't plan to go anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels), whom she may be married to. <br /> <br /> It would have been an OK movie if Honor did not play his Jeffrey so annoying, right from the start there is no chance of suffering him and it just gets worse and worse. Eventually we would like him, but there was no reason why he hadn't changed from the selfish brute to being in the beginning of the movie. Keaton doesn't seem to try and is in horrible form after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where should they believe their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, though they don't look very interested. Aside from a few small smiles, this movie doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there's almost nothing to laugh at! If your mood for a recent Diane Keaton flip looks Mad Money or Smother that is much better than this creepy effort.
