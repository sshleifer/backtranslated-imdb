This was longer than the Ten Commandments, the Lord of the Rings and the Matrix Trilogy combined. My oh, what a nightmare. This is the only major over-hype from 2006. There is not a moment that is not scripted and clich√©d. Film Musicals can be made excellent and bring true excitement to the viewer. Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese water torture in the form of endless music mounts, eerie appearances and poor conducting of elections. (Seriously, Mr. Condon, should you make the old Billboard countdown pictures? It's on # 58! No wait, see its rise up in the charts and here's the passing Billboard message to show you again .... and again .. .. and again)
