I usually like zombie movies, but one was simply bad. <br /> <br /> The good parts: Girl swim topless with thong bottom, Sonya Salomaa's topless and Ona Grauer's breasts jiggle in a skimpy top as she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: Too much video cuts, too much Matrix slow motion (it pulls the action), not enough blood and gut, bad acting and no story. The only other person in the theater was smart and went straight after the topless swim scene. A total waste of $ 6 and time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
