I saw this hope of finding out something I didn't know about modern history's most infamous man and couldn't think of the story being rewritten in HITLER: THE RISK OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirers' shots. Hitler came up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but haven't the authors confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE? It is bad enough, but what really offended me was that there were many clumps of historical connection in this mini-series. Germany lost the First World War, and the Allied forces made Germany pay a huge price to do so. It was this economic environment that made the German people have someone - someone - to restore their pride, and that is why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s, caused by the Allied forces, seems to be completely lacking, so it is not possible that HITLER: RISK OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document and I have not even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are sumptuous in their absence <br /> <br /> There is a positive point about the mini series and it's Robert Carlyle in the title role. Okay, some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too high (recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he manages to communicate Hitler's own charisma on the screen. Comments in the British press that Carlyle is similar to the synthesizer from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler is unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I liked Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hated everything else about this mini-series and wondered why in the world it was made in the first place. There is nothing to recommend it to serious story fans
