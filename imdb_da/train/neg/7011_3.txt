Unless you understand miserable profits, this movie won't mean much to you. One tried to mix a little humanity into a cold and gloomy period consumed by alcohol and drugs - it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak makes his big disco number, the voice is so obviously dubbed it's pathetic - the producers could at least have got someone who sounded distant as her. <br /> <br /> The documentary film that has been playing on television lately is much better and gives a much more threatening picture of the period of our history. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; however, he does an incredible job.
