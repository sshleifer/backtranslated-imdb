So ... we then see extra footage of Brando ... interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy things. Susannah York was hardly a slouch. New scene where Lois finds out Clark's Superman is a bit unbelievable because he doesn't feel that glosses come out of the gun instead of real balls. Real balls would have penetrated into his clothes and then jumped off him on the floor, but forget it ... Let's listen to Donner make fun of Lester's version, which made more logical sense. The president talks about the Zod "damaging" the Washington monument as it was originally Mount Rushmore. Tweaking the scene made the line completely absurd. The Superman's freedom of the press was stupidly compared to "..Drive to go outside", which was delivered better and had an appropriate connection to Clark's previous scene in the truck. Then there is the end of "returning the world to go back in time" effect. It turned all over the film and wondered how exactly the rocket aimed at Hackensack, N.J. ever went, as it no longer releases Zod and Company.
