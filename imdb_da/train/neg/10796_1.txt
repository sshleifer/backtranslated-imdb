This movie shows that the "commercial" movie theater is otherwise the Hollywood movies in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason why this film should have been produced except the fact that any expected success based on Shaquille's name. There is no worth referring to the plot: It is a little more confused than a knot. What else? The screen is a little weak, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
