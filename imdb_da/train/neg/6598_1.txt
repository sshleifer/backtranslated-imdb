This "movie" is a travesty. No, wait - an abomination. NO, wait - it is without a doubt the absolute WORST movie ever made with beloved characters created and established by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even daring to "restore" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are asinine and money clears. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy has been dead, respectively, in 1957 and 1965. Why anyone would like appropriate updates to L&H to be in the staff of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I fully voted in anticipation of being horrified and embarrassed and I was certainly not disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, disgrace should be blackballed from all that is associated with Hollywood and filmmaking. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS - THERE WILL BE WELL.
