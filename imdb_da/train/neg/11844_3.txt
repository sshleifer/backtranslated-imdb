Anyone who is a sucker for the 1920s jazz, 1920s dress, Charleston and ultra-swanky yachts (for example, me at all counters) would like this movie. But the sad fact is that it is all there is. The plot is banal and obvious, it mostly acts either horribly or plays the farcic side of the goings-on, and when the whole thing is over there is not much left, but impressions of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautifully made bad movie.
