I didn't expect a movie as good as "In The Fire of Fire" or an episode of "24" but it looked like this movie was made for television and did a mediocre job at best. The (good) cast could not explain that the plot was too predictable and the actors had to fight (they really try their best I think) through their bad writings, giving their rather flat characters some extra features. When I watched the movie, I got the feeling that I had seen most in other (better) movies. In it you had car races, big shootouts, romance, plot twists etc. Etc. This movie has no one. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the phone for Cuba's character, you know who is behind all this and all the tips you get ("you're too close the president, see it from my perspective .. ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it was up to me (and maybe it is not) I would rewrite the plot like this: <br /> <br /> First lady orders her husband's murder because She is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time.
