Everything I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken of the redeeming quality is how this film depicts such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral in a self-sustaining state of unfortunate events. Nevertheless, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) are over-exploited and thus convincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As far as the action was concerned, it was unclear, imaginative, incredible and coincidental. You can read most other reports on this movie and they will say pretty much the same as I wanted. <br /> <br /> Granted some of the actors and actors are attractive, but when confronted with such dull action ... you can only see a movie so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few strokes thrown here and there, and a final battle against the end. Nothing right to write home about. As others have said, 'BAD' movies are lovely to see because they are 'bad', you enjoy it. However, this film is a void. It's nothing. <br /> <br /> Also, if you really need an educational movie to scare people away from drug use, then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that control such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Although one should also check out some more lightweight films on the same subject as 'Go' (generally, both seriously and fun) and 'Halfbaked'. <br /> <br /> On a last note, the one possible redeeming line in this movie, provided by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. Believing that a bit of the big movie has been contaminated by 'Loaded' is weak. <br /> <br /> In general, I strongly suggest saving you money and your time by NOT watching this movie.
