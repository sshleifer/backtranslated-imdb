The worst movie I've seen for a while. Interesting first half with some engaging, thick dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar. The film then degenerates into a formless sequence of scenes aimed at visual shock (read disgust) without any redemptive observations or lessons in humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go out, but the director was present on this show and my courtesy prevents me from showing him disrespectfully. Still, the time is worthy (as the director himself observed in his introduction), and I really desire the time I wasted in the second half of this. <br /> <br /> Saving gracers were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female lead.
