My spouse & I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started well, but quickly became incredible and ridiculous. Most of the play was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who was really great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon, England. Even without renouncing anything when one of the people has a tragedy, she almost doesn't look unclear. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies and their heartwarming stories, but this movie doesn't rise for the sake of being one. There are so many good things - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.
