one of my friends bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never see it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD's cover looked pathetic, but my friends and I were really bored and looked at it. from start to finish! I know another success, but it really is a masterpiece. It is hard to describe. You should see, it is a real lesson on what people are capable of, when they think they are creative and wise and really not. "Acting" is the sous terrain (you can actually see "leading lady" laughing on some occasions, she's absolutely the worst). The "story" is too stupid to sum up, and really everything in this movie sucked. Please note the "sheriff". the guy is adult and therefore has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this. He is also extremely poor. Whatever it did have some hilarious moments. check it out, haha
