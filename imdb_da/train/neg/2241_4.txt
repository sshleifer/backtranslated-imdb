I remember enjoying it here a few years back, but coming back to it, I wonder why. I guess it always looks good and the girls do it pretty well, but the men rather make it down. Why oh, why in so many English movies about sex, should we have such horrible men alongside the beautiful girls? What's more, this probably starts as a sex color similar to the Confessions movies, but about. A third of the way through (while we begin to enjoy the lovely Me Me Lai's presence) asks the movie to start taking it seriously. Not only that, but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just watch the stem. In short, it is not as innocently stupid nor as intelligent as it seems to have. Richard O'Sullivan might have helped such a central figure, but I expect to be one of his worst ideas. Well worth the ladies.
