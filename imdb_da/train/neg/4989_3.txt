Les Visiteurs, the first movie about medieval time travelers was actually fun. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected phrases, fun situations and of course ordinary absurdity reminding you of a little Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now, this successor has the same characters, the same players in large part and the same time traveling. The reason is changing slightly, as the characters are now supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in the story without being aware that it is becoming absurd as you move on in the movie. The Duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep it all together with his game, but his character has been emptied so there is not much he can do to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, the Duke's slave / helper, he really has all the attention. The movie is just about him, and he is clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he should be. The facts are; This character tries to produce laughter from the audience, but he does not succeed. It is as if someone is telling you a very very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling the joke to the end and adding details to make your suffering a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, don't spoil the taste of your mouth with the sequel. If you did not like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel ... Well, I suppose you still have to watch many movies.
