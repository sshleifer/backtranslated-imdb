"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is definitely the worst movie ever made and even surpasses the unclear "Plan 9 from outer space". The lampoon film clears three separate and unconnected vignettes, each with different performing artists. The only common thread is the total lack of redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one is. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting naked shots are nice and he is right. Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry blink their assets beautifully, respectively, one and the other. But their glamorous screens are unfortunately wasted. The executives seem to have forgotten that even T&A needs a credible story that surrounds it, and no one is in sight. The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as a windup of this movie. Benson plays a young policeman who is anxious beaver and reports clearly for his first working day, ready to remove the streets of evil. He's mated to an old cynical politician played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we notice a possible redemption of the film's past mistakes. Perhaps, the cynical old-fashioned may be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. Perhaps everyone will end up succeeding. But unfortunately, this movie goes straight to the toilet, without redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind. Before "National Lampoon goes to the movies," I thought I had already seen the worst schlock Hollywood could possibly show. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen half of it. <br /> <br />
