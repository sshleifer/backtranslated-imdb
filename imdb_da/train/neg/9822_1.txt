There were times during the movie, I wish I had been killed. The only reason I made up the whole movie was because I couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it was going to get better. This was really a horror movie. I was appalled that I wasted what seemed 4 hours in my life that I never come back. The other two hours I spent grief at the loss. Please recommend this movie to whom you will torture and tell them that the thrill will kill them.
