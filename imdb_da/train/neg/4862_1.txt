This show is one of the worst shows of all time! absolutely no original jokes and they are always one year late. like in 2009, they will finally say something about Michael Vick's dog fights. All the cast members are people who would be on the SNL but had to go to the lowest of the bad twin. An hour of crazy magazine jokes that aren't fun to begin with, told by horrible John Stewart that bees. so if you have any problem, tell me I love to hear the opinion of the 3 people who see this show. family guy put it well "Osama bin Laden hid in one place no one would see, thrown by crazy TV. There is a reason no one sees the show.
