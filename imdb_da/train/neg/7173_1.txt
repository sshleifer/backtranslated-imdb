I hate plane crash movie ... ALL of them! In fact, I hate them all with a passion! First of all, they are cheap and have no craft! Second, they insult the aviation industry and say to the audience that all aircraft do it ... FALL OUT FROM THE SHOOTING AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why am I slipping on such a movie? This could happen to any of us and with worse consequences than those the characters in the movie have suffered ... which is the only chilling aspect of an airline's catastrophe like this. I hate this movie because it's like all the 50,000,000 stupid-red fly-chaos movies before! Freefall is like all the others: nothing but boredom before the clich√©-hit dramatic scenes take place. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same kind of retarder on this flying death trap: the Cleaver-esquire family of three, yuppie baastard and bitches of an air traffic controller complete with a big blond hairdresser from 1987 blame anyone who is least afraid! <br /> <br /> My second gripe is that this should not be a full-length movie, but a documentary explaining everything about the Air Canada "Gimbli Glider" event aka "Freefall" right down to the security measures. <br /> <br /> My third and final grip is with any airline movie of this caliber (except for fearless) Why in hell did the man manager instruct the passengers to remove that shoe? (I could understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but come on!) As it will make them more fake * king safer than they are now! This plane, if they (the passengers) didn't know anything better: knew they were going to collide land. Why would you force 100 injured people into a rubber wear that can peel and soften the skin just to go in their socks on a dirt field! Is that something reasonable for someone? <br /> <br /> Terrible and kind ABC series "Lost" had more depth and realism for air disaster than just "airplane malfunctions - people panic-stewards become assholes-flat countries without wheels in a field-people walking without shoes and jackets etc. The same old crap from Airport 1975! Freefall was so typical of an air-crash movie that I almost expect to see that either Charlton Heston or Peter Graves burst into the damned passenger cabin at least we could see how these ill-acted characters go back to normality instead of people rejoicing in the imminent tragedy staring in front of them? Typical moronic life policy! cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> The director of "Freefall" should keep for cheap TV movies with white medieval women with stupid teenage children who make drugs and have marriage problems. In terms of excitement ... leave it for the professionals ... you hack! Why should we crowd through more than one half hour? s airport wannabe rehash. I hope for God, they do not make air crash film like this anymore. If this was like the ABC series "Lost" then it would be something to see. But it is completely peeled and saw some. Stop Turning All Aircraft Disaster Movies to "Airport 1975"! This is not "Airport" This is cheap pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie or any television movie disaster to anyone, not even my worst enemies.
