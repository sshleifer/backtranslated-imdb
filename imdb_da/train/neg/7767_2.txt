To anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book this movie should be interesting. It is colorful, well-acted and portrays high adventure, but for us who know the original stories, it is appalling. I could hardly sit through it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screenwriters seem to be forced to rewrite the stories they work on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why does the writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it? In this case, the authors did themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: There was no mutiny on Renown. The officers took over the ship, after the half-mad captain had been driven quite sour as he fell through a hatchway - for reasons, but it was never given. There was no court battle. The right of inquiry was carried out in an almost congratulating atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor is Mr Ortega's wife. Hornblower, itself, was never in the brig either on the ship or on land. There are plenty of such manipulations of Forrester's history. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think the movie's repeated use of the flashback device hurts the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, why did screenwriters have to destroy a good story?
