When considering documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right and conservative groups like this in the United States, consider the following. The United States, with a population of 270 million and its complex history as a hopeful democracy and its hope, wants to maintain human rights, has its faults and disadvantages. It is, of course, expected that extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups exist in significant numbers, but in relation to the size of the population they are very small and isolated. Indeed, based on per capita Europe, UK and even Australia, similar right-wing groups have on a per capta basis, the actual size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States. It is for the above reasons that it is unjustified to dismantle and disturb the American people and their level of debate in the Educated American Society by presenting this ultra-right wing of psychopaths as being representative of American society very fraudulently and fraudulently. By doing so, Greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of America that is a monstrous and deliberately sensationalist lie. This film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to views of people who end up this subconscious and morbid hate the American people and lifestyle under the guise of strained fashionable and clich√© idealistic leftist ideology. This film was made for profit not to promote the truth about the American Society and the human condition. The Greenstreet can make documentaries focusing on ultra-right-wing conspiracies, the military industrial complex, but failing to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate, let alone alternative solutions to the failure of a living democracy. The Movie Show is exposed as Anti American by its support for this trash. SENSATIONALISM on its worst anti-US waste shameful.
