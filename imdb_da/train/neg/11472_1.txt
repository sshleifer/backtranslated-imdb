Everything about this movie was terrible. Initially, this movie had a really good cast, and I find it impossible to make such a huge cast in the greatest disaster for the gangster movie genre ever. The sound track was like one of a very poor slapstick comedy. It had this music throughout the movie, and it started to be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NOT PLEASE NOTE YOURSELF WITH THIS CLEANING THAT WILL ONLY BE CLEAN
