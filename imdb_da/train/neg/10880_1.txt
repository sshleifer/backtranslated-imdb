This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have a good appetite for horrible (and good) movies. It could (just) have had some kind of youth humor if it had been consistently heavy in the cheek - then the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really great fun. Other movies, such as PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, are fun, while (apparently) trying to be serious. Regarding the play, it seems that they rounded brain-dead teens and asked them to ad-lib the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - that of the older ghoul busting broad on the motorcycle.
