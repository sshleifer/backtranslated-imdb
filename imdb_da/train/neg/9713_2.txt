The first time I saw that Cold Case was after it was about a year on Danish TV. At the time it came to television, it almost drowned in 4 or 5 other US crime programs that showed about the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was bored to death. The entertained actors with the self-righteous faces and morals were a pain in the rear. The whole assumption that so much money was given to a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. The time is also a factor as they only have 50-60 minutes to tell the story, which means they get a break in time to resolve the matter and bring right to surviving family members if they are still alive. This, combined with the "personal" problems and relationships between investigators, which must be time to leave, shows a complete lack of attention. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 star rating because of the music, I end up being really the only reason to see it .... which of course you won't do as it is a reason to look at this crap.
