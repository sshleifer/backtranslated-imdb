Sorry, did I miss something? did I go out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) Stories made me think "This will be classic" But it was all down the hill from there! The action was brilliant for what it is worth William H Macy's great and just getting better and better every movie I see him in. But it never seemed to connect. I waited for the big moment when all the stories connect and then suddenly. It rains the frog ?? It was if the author said, "I've gone deep, how can I pull all those stories together wisely .... Oh, I just want to make it rain frogs." I like clever movies, I like weird movies, but it was just weird and boring. 4.10
