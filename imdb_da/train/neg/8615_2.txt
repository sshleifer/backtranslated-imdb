This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had hard times to see it at the end. I had seen this Rodney guy in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was fun as hell in it, but this movie was crap. "The Witnesses" were not funny, the actors were not funny, something about it was not even extremely fun. Don't waste your time on this! The only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon, whom I definitely tried her best, but the script was just too terrible. That's why I've rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
