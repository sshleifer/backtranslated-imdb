This tedious Las Vegas casino hoist movie in almost impossible to see and get involved in. It's something you're looking at if you absolutely have nothing else to do. The only two decent things in this movie are both linked to the beautiful Stella Stevens, and a user of the entire program hopes that she will fall out of one of the skimpy tops she wears. Many fantastic shots from the mid-70s Las Vegas (as it was still a cool place to visit) and today's fashion is good for a giggle too. Otherwise a big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transmission, but even in under 10 bucks it's still not worth my humble opinion.
