First half was ok but last half really really disappointed. It's fun, the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue about the end, and it really did. What is really sad, I have to write ten lines for comment minimum to be able to post this. I really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my comments as the show isn't really worth doing. When Battlestar Galatica first came out, I was really thrilled with the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen the first season limit to being a rumor. They finally cleaned a little and actually had some fair drama so I started to look again. But to finish the series with kara was a cyclone god angel, the same with bales and six was pretty stupid.
