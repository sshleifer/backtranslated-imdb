... And being let down bigger than ever before. I will not make any direct references or anything here, but at least this film is pathetic. If you're military-trained, don't forget to look. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends who want to see some interesting action / war girl. Why couldn't I just read reviews first. <br /> <br /> Already on the first "bomb" scene, the movie has great glitches and they continue to show and grow bigger and bigger. My 2 friends who were not connected to the military had in any way discovered a couple of filmmakers' mistakes almost as fast as myself and asked me if some of the things were happening, we are realistic. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you are able to overlook these completely idiotic and repetitive mistakes. 2/10 to catch my interest in the beginning.
