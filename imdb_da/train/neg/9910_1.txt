One of the worst movies ever. Not fun, poor TV-style filmography, bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors who can hardly walk, let alone act. Leader female Nancy Young cannot act. Horrible direction. Sub-parameters with bad TV movies. Occasionally weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense. Somehow they should stop a wedding, but there is no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing made my wife stop seeing, but I suffered through it. The old men must act as they are young and horny, but it comes out as pathetic rather than fun. How did they get the money to do this themselves?
