For those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten, the Disney company almost went down the pipes in the late 1980s. People didn't watch their movie anymore, and the company didn't produce the usual healthy material .... at least not what people expected. A big problem: ghost. <br /> <br /> Yes, the idiots running the Disney movies over the decade would produce hard-to-say movies - including the Lord's name in vain if you can believe it - scattered in these "family" movies. In fact, it happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> In addition to language problems, this movie also has an unpleasant tone to it, making it unlikely almost from the beginning, luckily Disney woke up and produced one Lots of good material since these decadent 80s movies. ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under a different name.)
