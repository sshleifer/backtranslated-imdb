Thank God, I saw this in a friend's place and didn't pay for it. The plot is terribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show. If you have knowledge about computers or electronics, beware. You will feel that the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Also, actress turned a lot of music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst play I've ever seen, excluding porn. She's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He is the one who bears the film. <br /> <br /> I hate wasting almost two hours in my life and watching this movie! It's a shame they should call it a successor because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
