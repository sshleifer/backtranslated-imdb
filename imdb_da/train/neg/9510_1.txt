Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies in 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and bring it on and fail. When I saw last January, I was so disgusted with the movie that I was talking on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. I've heard that the DVD has a director's cut, maybe I'll check it out, but this PG-13 trash movie is so *** and the worst kind of ***. Maybe if the movie had something T & A that would have done it okay. But the gags are paralyzed and the play is terrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
