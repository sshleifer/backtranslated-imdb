What a shame that Alan Clarke must be associated with this tripe. However, it does not exclude it; Get a group of guys and some Stellas together and get a whale at a time running this over and over and rolling around on the floor in laughter tears. Great wasted night things. Al Hunter is based on a well-publicized theme in the late 80's - that hooligans were well organized and not really interested in football itself - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent ???). But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors of other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or soon move on to poor-quality drama (Eastenders) can, in a nanosecond, make us believe that they are hard football thugs are ridiculous. Do we really have to believe that the ICF (if of course the drama is based) will NEVER go to another city to fight with only six blocks? <br /> <br /> The ICF would crowd out stations and the like with hundreds. Andy Nicholls' Scally must be read before even considering a story of this kind. The action is appalling and gives most of the laughs. Oldman is such a camp, it's incredible. Most of them seem to be in the bath by Mr Matey. A true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick-go for it.
