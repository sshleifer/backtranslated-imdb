Recently, I have been obsessed with this movie so much that I almost had to watch it. Well, since you have just seen it today, the 5.8 score is quite understandable. I think if you expect something so much that it needs a need, it doesn't turn out to be worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills has eyes 2 having its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed story that ties well with the product itself, but it is all so self-satisfied that it becomes so difficult to follow. And if it wasn't for Wes Craven's production on this movie, it wouldn't be a thing of the original remake. <br /> <br /> But it all makes you go "Should it be scared or COMEDY?" because there are lots of ridiculous, randomly placed bounces and stupid a liners (IE "There is a hand in sh ** is!" or "You motherfu ** is! I will kill all regular sons of b ** tches!") and the actor (God doesn't even remind me how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers, beware!) The movie begins with a woman giving a mutant baby (ooh la la! ), and then the screen changes to black with the movie's title, and a monologue, then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veterans, and we find out that this scientist is keeping track of people who Looking for mutants The box to keep track of sound feeds is gone and everyone dies! After the tone-tuned opening, you would expect more. <br /> <br /> Then we go to this team of military recruits training in Baghdad. parading them "A good job of stupidity" is their last training day in New Mexico, the desert. Or the family in the last THHE had remained because use they were firm. During training, things eventually go wrong, people die, and ... should I tell you more? Because right now I have the attention of a goldfish that forces me to sit here and write it. <br /> <br /> What goes wrong with THHE2 is that it just doesn't work. No flashbacks here, and the end is pretty safe ... but with a twist! A stupid one, that is. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all its alternate endings, but at this point I'm not sure I care. <br /> <br /> So if you loved the first THHE so much, then it's almost a shame not to see this, so watch it anyway. But if otherwise, avoid at all costs. It is for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
