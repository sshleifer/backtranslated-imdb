Yes, the only thing this movie is memorable for is that it starred a young Tom Hanks, who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here, however, is not a movie that will show off its talents much at all, and the only thing that can be considered as entertaining about this flick is the stage where he thinks he sees a monster and drives a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evil of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and tries to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, one after school type special about the evil of the game Dungeons and Dragons beautifully retrieved here like Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the decision makers of this movie believed that geeks shouldn't have fun of any kind unless they were going out and making underage drinks, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harassing other weaker children like all the popular kids did. No, these bad people played a game that actually required one to use that brain, no heaven! Not that, if they have a brain, they can actually think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is totally stupid and a waste of time. Admittedly, it could be a film against addiction, but there are many fewer people who died with the Dungeons and Dragons far in all existence than than saying what is drinking claims for a month.
