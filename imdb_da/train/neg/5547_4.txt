REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not a far lost ancestor of the classic George A. Romero zombie flicks. This is a low budget pot boiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to the audience of the time ... but seems terribly routine these days. In fact, there is a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing his gun into a horde of nourishing zombie soldiers ... and a close-up of bullets entering the chest of one cross. The effect looks hopelessly false these days, but in 1936 I am sure it had the audience gasping. The story relates to the search for the secret of mind control ... apparently to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means of a sign to win the woman, he loves. The film is barely an hour long, but moves at the snail's pace, so it seems like function length, believe me! There really isn't much to recommend it ... you can get some entertainment from the star-studded studio shot, "wading" through a "swamp". The end is interesting ... so I would say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap "4 movies on 1 DVD" compilation at Wal-Mart for five bucks. Hey, it's worth the money ...
