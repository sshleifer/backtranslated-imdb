I really started to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his movie could be. This particular movie was a complete and complete waste of time to watch. My first complaint was the DVD's cover, where they have dictated his image and made him look leaner and younger when he looks in the movie he looks like crap. and bored looking at his face. The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and stated too long. The whole movie was leading to the final, where Seagal and his team had to take a lot of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline amplifier. There was also the way of very useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant surge of Seagal's voice, even in the middle of a statement. The double voice sounded like a man with a seed in his throat and was quite comical. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes in the movie were horrible. Half the time when Seagal foug ht you couldn't even see what was going on. There would be tight shots of him clapping the arms of the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something. It is reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television. They used way too much slow motion for battle scenes. <br /> <br /> I think this is Seagals worst movie to date, and I'm glad I didn't buy this movie, or I would have been very sorry when I'm a big fan by Seagal the Aikidoist. The action star is quickly fading away and seems to get worse with each performance.
