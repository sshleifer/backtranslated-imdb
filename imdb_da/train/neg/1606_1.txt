In this film, Chávez followers (either Venezuelan or non-Venezuelan) are just about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They didn't say the conflict started because of the Chávez message, which fired many PDVSA best workers just for political issues. They said nothing about more than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chávez in just 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscation o private TV signals). Each with approx. 20 minutes duration. They did not tell us anything about the release of general and jefe lucas rincon romero, military general inspector general, who is a traditional supporter of chávez. Even now, despite his announcement, he is Ministro de Interior and Justicia. After returning, Chavez placed Ministro del Defensa (similar to US Secretary). They did not say anything about Chávez orders to shoot against a pacifical people concentration that claimed choices. They did not say anything about the people of this concentration who were killed by Chávez Supporters (either civil and military official forces). They present some facts in the wrong order to lie. <br /> <br /> They didn't say anything about the Venezuelan civil society, which itself claims a choice to resolve the crisis and the Chávez actions to avoid the elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you .... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.
