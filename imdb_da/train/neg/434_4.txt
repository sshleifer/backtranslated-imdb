Already his first claim that these desires are always artificial, is completely false. <br /> <br /> When a Witness rejects his own documentary film on film? or something for that matter - it's time for everyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, Paris Hilton says (I don't know it's not too hard) Zizek's mouth jumps as much baloney as her, just another kind. He combines the worst of both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for comfortably offering the expert b * lls *** osopher plenty of leeway to create inevitable theories, to run without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process abusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only one mother can love. Example: There are three great Marx brothers, therefore, a "good" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, id, ego, and super-ego. I'm surprised he didn't play a clip from "Snowhite" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Muslim hell). It's like the prerequisite for Schumacher's "The Number 23": Play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even pairing old Greeks with Princess Di's death. <br /> <br /> However, there is an entertainment element for the TPGTC: to see a rumbling lunatic sweat like a hog, while retrieving delusions masked as intellectual analysis can be very fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or another madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an entertaining train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost fun at once or twice. I have always been mystified by people who are desperately trying to raise the film formation to a lofty intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like "Birds" this much believed, therefore, this great credit, has probably its fat creator laughing in its grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few who have some intelligence do not need a shrunk philosopher to draw a card to understand them? unless you are a complete idiot. Zizek sees teams and teams with meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs should be pretty popular and cheap in Slovenia these days ... When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the "Psycho" noise, I thought he should say something about galactic black holes; how they drain their lives out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh's blood. Or maybe he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into it rather than out (as in menstruation), this represents a kind of "smart (Zizekian) irony". Talking about which, the real irony is, if Hitchcock had really put so many thoughts into each scene (and the script), his movie would not have been the illogical, long-term shit as they often are. The starting point for these tubular hole analogues was to show how easy it is to improvise on "hidden, deep meanings". And when you add Zizek's imaginative terminology from philosophy and psychology, you make these expressions beyond these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a striking jumble that can instantly impress the undeveloped - that is, the printable and the happy. <br /> <Zizek pulls out a number of (unintentional) fun things here, one of the most absurd ideas is when he connects Anthony Perkin's cleansing of the bloody bathroom with "satisfaction with the work, a good job". Don't laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the author of "Psycho" could ever even have vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might enjoy a well-done work - cleaning a blood-stained toilet - while the concepts / directed scene. Talk about putting words in his (dead) mouth, but in the context of interpreting what the director might say. <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's original thoughts on Tarkovsky's amazing Solaris, but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by drawing on "anti-feminism" and other nonsense in his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's approach to logic is a dog's approach to his plastic leg. "I just want to play with it all day!" Logic has its rules and must not be raped - at least not publicly - by him. He seems to consider logic, evidence, common sense and reason as enemies or mere throwing toys; Concepts that must either be avoided, twisted to fit the final goal or simply wiped out. Zizek is the LSD-threatened hippie, and all his favorite films are his own personal "2001" s. <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek is overfocusing on two of the most overrated instructors - and those whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - like Hitchcock and Lynch, only reduces its already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma was no more prominent; It's another lame director who writes inappropriate scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who saw it. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer easily accepts von Trier's ridiculous "groundbreaking" physical set-up in "Dogville" I made snicker. <br /> <br /> But Zizek not only does things up while walking together, he also strongly praises the "bleedin" obvious. "Like all" social scientists "(an oxymoron) he wraps up his very strict" observations " articulation (if they are full of saliva) and sometimes complex carpets of language Sociology works in the same way after all: it makes us believe that we hear something new when it is actually what we all already know, but told in an eloquent way - that fools the more subconscious listener. <br /> <br /> I was half-expected for men in white suits to suddenly get out of nothing and strap him up in a wage suit ... <br /> < Slavoj Zizek: Soon as a stalker in a children's park near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
