You lose 100 IQ points just to set. This show must be horrible, I refuse to set aside from what I've seen in advertising. Where did they dig this guy anyway? What do they intend to do next season? The secret is out. Everyone already knows the setup? Should they search for people who have lived under a rock to star next season? Where should they dig up more stupid women? No wonder America is a great joke to outsider's, see what you see !!
