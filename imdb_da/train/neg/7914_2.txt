This movie was slated to be a blockbuster movie, and it really is. This is the type of movie made to eat popcorn and see the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the film, perhaps not as well as the ultra-modern Iron Man, delivers, but good enough. Outside of popcorn munching action and special effects, the movie falls faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers, even included, will complain about how most characters were severely altered, but it only makes the movie a bad fit, not a bad movie. This movie is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The creators focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The long awaited and promoted characters are reduced to 4-stage comos. The main characters in Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are thrown to the road to make room for the important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes as it is Sabertooth, though Victor draws some surprises late in the movie. <br /> <br /> The "final boss" of the movie is a twisted and versatile adaptation of the original character and gets almost no development to show just why he's the way he is. The filmmakers, of course, felt that all they really needed was to create a bad ass character that could do everything they wanted and relaxed on the name of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
