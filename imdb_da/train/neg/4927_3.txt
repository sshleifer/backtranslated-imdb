Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial issues, but it may be the first to get wide viewing thanks to TCM. This film is her accusation of abortion, but she crawls the problem by bringing in eugenics and contraception, giving the impression that they somehow correspond to abortion. Her talent in writing and the other film skills is well shown here, but one can be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically. If you've wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s "famous father" looked like, here's your chance. 1916 fashion and cars are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's fun even if you don't appreciate the propaganda.
