I'm still trying to find out if there was a point on this movie. <br /> <br /> For content that should be so "rebellious" and "controversial", the things that Maddox distributes to students are terribly paralyzed. Students seem to be easily weakened by vague anti-authoritarian feelings and extracts of words illegally scrawled on brochures. Rebel, everyone. I suppose it would have been too much to ask for a teenage rebirth movie where a school fire alarm does not start. <br /> <br /> Apparently a "giant fight up the football pitches" is a two-person battle. People in figures seem to vary randomly. A football jerk whom Maddox fought (and later got a staple on his face) smiles all and apologizes for the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that it doesn't come to any concrete conclusion from the plot makes me feel that it could all have been mounted for half an hour after the school's special. If they had cut most of the tried pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
