I agree with most other guys. Waste of photons and valuable time. Almost no joke is worth the paper written on. The only highlight from my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This is reminiscent of old times with RTL Saturday Night. It's hard to describe the actors' notions, as most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just "do their thing". The camera is ok, the plot is ridiculous, I think you would be ashamed of yourself even though you are discussing this with lots of beer. <br /> <br /> Apart from this I constantly yawned, wondering how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end. My 9-year-old son was happy, but then he is satisfied with so little at this age :-) <br /> Anyway, a 1 point rating here is almost 1 point too much ...
