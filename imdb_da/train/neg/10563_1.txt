Time spent watching this movie was time wasted. I don't like science fiction. I do not reject any genre in itself, as good work can be done in any genre. However, this film is not good work. I can't fault the visuals (when they don't involve foreign makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not out-and-out BAD, for a trekkish cartoon. But of course visuals were of course where all the decision makers' interest / attention / money went. The direction changed between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure who did what and what and for whom at least one crucial time). "Acting" was mostly very bad. There was no basis for most of the lines except a hint of "That was the way on the side, and the director told me that I should be sad / sad / scared / whatever. Okay, so it was an SF series pilot. When is it an excuse for corrective shoddiness in areas where it should be considered crucial to a dramatic medium, I am astonished that the pilot sold the series, or is the money also in the hands of technerds?
