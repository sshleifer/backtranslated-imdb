Another Priyadarshan / Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP instead of the actual wish, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others ), but it was needless to say had low expectations from this movie. I was happy about the casting in general, except Rajpal Yadav, who once again annoys without limits, however, he does some laughs, but it was these standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dholen, I mean that it hardly takes any talent to make loud sound, or even play the odd good pace of dhol in an instant does it ?? It is only those who can carry different strokes in a good sequential manner for a long period of time considered to be large. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the second instrument, Dumroo hardly demands any talent, it has no variations, and it can be fun for a while aberdans (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it is not an instrument that will entertain you for a long time or even make you dance like Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This movie was like the Dholen and the Duma was played, sometimes Dholen sometimes played dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any 24 year old I got bored. <br /> <br /> The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments, but after a while everything I heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining at first, so tolerable and annoying) that the big ordinary parts really ensures that this movie is mainly good for some fun clips on "MORE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you haven't seen it look at Filmy, it comes in the evening and is really quite fun). <br /> <br /> This movie had its moments, the actors did a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act even though I've seen him in the Main Meri Patni ??) who annoys more than entertain, I've said It many times and I will say it again. I really believe that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies in particular. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really fun as the interrupted attempts to impress the girls' father, trying to venture the girl and take her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after this, in vain attempts to make this movie more with a mystery, it meant that when the girl was in, the following 45-60 minutes were increasingly tortured, The climax was "so bad that they were very good," I mean, what were they thinking if you should have tense end at least make some effort to make it tasteful. <br /> <br /> The movie is also highly predictable, it is hardly a scene you cannot predict, and you will not break into the spontaneous crazy of laughter here it is more like you see it coming and almost beginning to laugh before the gag. The film follows a gradual decline in the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then quickly tumbler downhill once they have made friends with the girl. Most of the really bad scenes were at the end, a movie trying to be more than a run of the mill's comedy, also many of the jokes were very obsolete and reeked of repetition, the last 10-15 being particularly dISTATFULL and completely flushing it MOVIE . <br /> <br /> I didn't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was going to play, and her actress talent is in serious question, especially considering her non-pleasing appearance if you can't be a HOT and can't act where much time you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film was weak, with constant female gaze and scary lighting and camera work. The songs apart from the title track were also not good when the songs played in the second half, I could feel the collective gasp from the audience. <br /> <br /> In all a movie that is just plain just because of the cast and the very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoid it will not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And seeing it on TV for free or a very cheap matin√©e or something is a must if you pay full multiplex prices, you will feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> - There are lots of outdated jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LATEST 45 MINTS AND LATEST 15 LESS SPECIAL, Poor Technical, Bad Songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s are trying to be more than what it wasn't the regular cast (Tanushree Datta), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + Some good scenes against the start, title song, good acting and cast except RY. <br /> a total of 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to be objective here, I don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta, and this movie met my very low expectations, so I give it all the benefit about absolute terms this movie was no more than a 4)
