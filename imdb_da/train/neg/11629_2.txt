** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is completely unrealistic, lacks a plot, and was basically made only to see stars portraying themselves. The most exciting scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower, and then we see her TV playing the shower scene from PSYCHO. In fact, this movie expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER STARTER *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer wastes his gut to Shabana Azmi for a long time to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to run up and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDS *** <br /> <br /> Hearing the instructor and throwing members who throw off insults against each other and hear Shabana Azmi is a bit humorous (a little). Complain: "Oh!" All in all, a baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of ********** (2 out of 10)
