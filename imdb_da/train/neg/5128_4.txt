This early B entry in the patriotic category beat a beautiful young Gene Tierney on ads and posters, but you have to wait a while before looking at her and driving in a Hollywood camel train. Previously, we have set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who hardly come together but need to rally in the attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy trip. However, Bruce Cabot's charm is basically a mystery to me - he is basic and unmatched in comparison, but I have always felt that he had just come, smiling, under a car, covered in fat and a sixth grade education. Some people like them that way, as does Genes gypsy queen character. This is an action adventure filler, tho, and just as we have been warned about invading locals with weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their country, there is a final gun battle where we must lose the protagonist for good of all . This feature requires nothing more than your worst attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who did anything, it was paired with better. It was almost more interesting to identify Dorothy Dandridge's great support casting and a surprising appearance in one of her first roles. A two or two and a half stars out of five. -MMM
