Usually I don't like revenge movies .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has little more than your typical revenge plot premise. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locations (ie, Hong Kong), awesome gunfights and enough martial arts to satisfy your urge for impressive unarmed combat. Like all revenge flicks, it has villains you will love to throw out of a top-floor glass top of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has none of the sensational crap that swells the plot and the elitist, racist, and toxic social stereotypes that invaded "Eye for a Eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> But in plot department Double Impact is as transparent as Saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mob-drawn squad associated with a family friend with money problems or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation why the boys spoke in French accents is a miserable one. It was not the watery plot that made this movie bad, but the use of clich√©s and movements from other films (from deadly weapons to princess bride) made it really worse. But Double Impact can still be seen. But why is it such a sloppy movie as this has bad guys (for example, the greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents and the deadly lesbian red-haired chick) would you love to hate with fiber of your being?
