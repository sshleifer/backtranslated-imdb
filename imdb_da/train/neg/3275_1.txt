DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED CLASS AS WOMEN WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE MUST DISSAPPOINT I BAD! First of all, this movie starts with Bo and Luke, who run the moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke wouldn't ever do the right thing! This film depicts unimaginable characters who do things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and legal. In this movie, he is a criminal who makes moonshine and smokes grass with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension that added to the dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: How can Uncle Jesse make MOONSHINE, WHERE THERE BEFORE DUCK OF HAZZARD IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIE? AND HOW BOSS HOGG IS DELIVERED WHEN GIVING BEFORE THE REUNION FILE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? It seems that these characters came back to life when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family-friendly movie with the live original characters that made the show what It was and still is comparable to this disgusting, quirky movie! If you want to watch great Dukes movies, either buy the original series or go out on walmart.com and buy the 2-set DVD that includes Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both star the original cast and are family friendly! Don't waste your time on a movie that's not worth the CD it's written on!
