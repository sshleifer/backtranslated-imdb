Please note that I haven't seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and doesn't carry it. But I really want to say something about it. I actually do research for the university at the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person they based on the protagonist was really quite different !!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license admitted, the actual Dr. Bucke completely connected hysterectomy to cure madness in women and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film. I think it is ridiculous to see various film critics writing for legitimate newspapers saying that this movie has some historical foundation! The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Don't waste your time on a movie with such a disregard for the horror that real women experienced in the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry.
