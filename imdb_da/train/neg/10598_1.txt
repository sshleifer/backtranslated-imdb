this is a piece s - t !! this looks worse than one made for t.v. movie. and I shutter to believe that a successor was even admitted, and the results ... war is more beautiful than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and he is wondering why his career is where it is now. no script, no history and no time should be wasted on this. I mean it. 1 out of 10 is too high, too high. goldberg would be jackhammered for this. van shame is no actor.
