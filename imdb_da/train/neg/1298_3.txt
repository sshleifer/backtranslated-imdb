Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker in the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji clan. The film production has the most important characteristics of a low budget production, including unclear combat scenes and clumsy assemblies (the kind you might find in a sub-produced dorama). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his fate lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that protects the Gojoe Bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring him into complete conflict with almost any element of society that time could serve him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> However, there is no lack of ambition in its depiction of the conflict between the sacred and the secular. Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing helps to compensate for the loose filmmaking style. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
