I have to admit that there are few books with similar films that I actually read before I see the biographical adaptation. Ninety-eight and forty-eight happen to be one of the rare cases. The book was great. It was nearby and interestingly prophetic. But the movie is simply sucked. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I didn't turn off after the first 5 minutes was that it was half of a two-part task for a class to watch the movie. It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing to get the right atmosphere. The action was not above average, and given the fact that there was little to trade, this was seriously disappointing. For example, the book did not give me the impression that Winston could not wipe out more than one syllable at a time. Drilling, disturbing and visually uncomfortable, the film completely cannibalized the book. Wait a minute ... Isn't it British?
