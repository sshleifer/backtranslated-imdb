Imagine being asked for your movie what movie you would watch, and remember to see a pretty fascinating trailer about "The Grudge". So in good faith, you recommend watching that movie. It's the halloween season. And this made the Boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good ... so you go. <br /> <br /> And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends as it does, and you hear yourself obediently saying, "It can't be the end of the movie ...." Unfortunately, the. <br /> <br /> Imagine getting out of the cinema embarrassed and ashamed to recommend such a dog of a movie. You think your date is a kid to suggest such cruelty, and your proposal will definitely end up with a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both cracked and laughed at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and suggest she's holding on to television in the future. In fact, it won't be long before she is shipped to flea market conventions selling Buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough if you ask me. Terrible, horrible, horrible. The reason did not make sense; continuity was terrible. It is clear that the whole end was designed to have a "Grudge II - Return of" Cat-Boy "."
