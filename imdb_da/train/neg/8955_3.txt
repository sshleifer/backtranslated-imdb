As far as the movie goes, it's an OK science fiction movie. It has many great things in it and some quality scenes. That said, it is not so good, and some of the things are pretty much taken. <br /> <br /> As to call this second cube movie is complete and complete bullsh! T. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original film ... The whole feeling of it can translate something into the core of the first, but the introduction of humans / androids as part of the "team" behind the actual cube is something a stretch ... I gave this a 3 *** because of the rear of the original. This should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie, that there is no room or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> Can be seen for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommendable to fans of the series ...
