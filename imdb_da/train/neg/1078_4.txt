Divorce lawyer Rick Magruder (Branagh) stumbled full of a party hosting his business one night and having a chance meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss (Davidtz) who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car. Rick drives the woman to her home and they discover that her car is already parked there, apparently by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory go into the house and war on the situation when Mallory carries carelessly in front of Rick and he spends the night with her. Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory meets him later today and asks him to judge against his father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her, has succeeded in having Dixon landed and sent to jail, but when he is freed from his local friends, Rick finds himself in trouble and tries to protect himself and his children from the danger he unknowingly brought to life.
