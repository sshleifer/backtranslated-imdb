I chose this movie to replace the bad choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. Well before, it's better than daytime television .... even though I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It has its points, but after the first 20-30 minutes the good point pan out is and one comes to the conclusion that they see one made for TV movies that were put together with not Much time to do something that will stick together. In short, a horrible Sci Fi channel type movie. <br /> <br /> It has its points that the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course it's not "Blade Runner". The captain looks like the actor Robert Forster, the kind of person you might be around. But unfortunately it gets a bit like a bad "Andromeda" rehash where the muscles of the crew consist of poor copies of the smart guns of "Aliens", the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified, and the new captain may as well be Jan-Michael Vincent drives around "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits"; he only put on the uniform with epaulets; He has very little right to it. Everybody runs around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like 'Eureka Maru' as they struggle with a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are divided into several tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities ....... like the nietzcheans in "andromeda". It can have a redeeming function with Michael Ironside, but after a while you get the feeling that he took part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but it doesn't help the movie much. <br /> <br /> That's ..... "okay". Okay in the way you might see the DVD once without turning it off; If they see it with advertising, they will probably change the channel. You can see it once .......... but a few hours later, wonder what it was that made them see it all. <br /> <br /> For me it was femme fatale. ............ when she fought.
