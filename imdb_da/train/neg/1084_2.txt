I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director, although Robert Altman may be hit or miss. In this case, it was a great lady. Altman's attempt to create excitement fell on his keester. Having seen Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again", I didn't think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen in the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes appearing in food money films like this. Duvall was once a great actor in outstanding films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies" but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
