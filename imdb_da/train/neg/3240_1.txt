This is the first guinea pig movie from Japan, and this is the most sickly, in my opinion. A bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point I would say that these movies are not real! They are fake horror movies trying to be as realistic as possible. The scenarios are diseases, but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and shred the floor near the girl! And how stupid it looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include the small intestine that is thrown at the girl, the girl is exposed to loud sounds for many hours, the ripping of the fingernails, the worms placed on the wounds of the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in terrible details and things like that. Very ill and medieval film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematic significant. This first entry is the sickest and most amateur guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Meat and Blood, trying to be as shocking as possible. Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen, and the closest thing is to snuff there. This is still (of course) faked s (n / t) uff, the only difference of real "snus film" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this movie. I cannot recommend this to anyone as it is so s **** y and offensive. Those who consider this a great horror movie understand nothing about the cinema and the real meaning of it. I saw this as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant waste it is. They only work in shock level and it is not for valuable cinematic performance. The devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest movie I've seen, and the mermaid in a manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've seen. So it's pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
