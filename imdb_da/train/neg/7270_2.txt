I gave this loooooooooooong movie a "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you cannot read as a speed-reader, you will NEVER get through the subtitles trying to keep track of the Spanish speed that speaks! And what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. Endless staring and goof-eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good movie pictures, but also some so dark, you think your screen is burnt out. How this won something I will never understand. Difficult to talk about "ACTING" when leading actors seem to stare and look lovingly at each other when they do not push each other away. The character Geraldo is so attractive that it's hard to believe anyone would push him away. And what's with her mother? I was simply not getting the most out of time, except there were three guys who all seem to have had a story with each other .... but never figured out who was "EX".
