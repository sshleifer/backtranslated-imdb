Surely one of the most badly recommended remakes of a classic in film history - especially since the promise of its roofline, "The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure all the time", is not even properly used! Although this movie was regularly shown on TV in my forest head since my childhood days, it kept its infamy (for horror, not erotic content, remember you) away from it until now - and I only relocated because I recently enjoyed Bo Derek's former film, 10 (1979), and has seen many fantasy things just over Christmas. <br /> <br /> Lead actor / producer Bo Derek is quite ridiculous in living in schoolgirl-ish sexually innocent (witnessing the inappropriate banana scene) and, as expected, she is made to get her clothes off a few times, but so well as these scenes were, she looked so much more sensual in 10 than she does here; Richard Harris then captures nature incessantly as Jane's occupied explorer father, but John Philip Law hardly records as his aid, passionately showing some original interests in Jane himself; beginner Miles O'Keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entry for 45 minutes in the movie, is completely silent all but his famous yodel (who is probably lifted from Johnny Weissmuller anyway!) and is as inaccurate as one of the trees dangerer he regularly in the second half of the film! to the post, he later starred in two ATOR films (or would be CONAN imitators) for Joe D'Amato and the King Arthur era, VALGET SWEDEN (1984). <br /> <br /> When there is still an actor, director John Derek (who also serves as his own film photographer) has worked with some great filmmakers (Cecil B. De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and a couple good (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel), but he clearly taught zilch from them, as his direction of this one is a great responsibility: horribly pretentious at times (witnessing the absolutely horrible python attack sequence) with a meaningless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheeses transitions; this was Derek's seventh film as an instructor (and his second of four with wife Bo) and eventually he would only get two more. <br /> <br /> The movie's complete flaws can only be measured by the fact that Tarzan's legend was once again tackled on film - in GREYSTOKE: TARZAN'S LEGEND, APES HEELS (which, surprisingly, I haven't seen yet) - just three years later !! Nominated for Six Razzie Awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and winning one for Bo Derek himself, TARZAN, APE MAN was co-written by Gary Goddard, the forthcoming director of another expected but ultimately disappointing implementation to the silver screen of a (this time animated) heroic figure, MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE (1987), which I will also revise at the moment (yay)! In spite of a charming closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing around with an orang-outside and a music score that is not semi-actual and quite praised at times, any delayed good intention is defeated by an extremely stupid climax involving native paintings Stay completely white and bad, John Derek's clear interest in Tarzan's own character, which makes him come as an insignificant supportive sign in his own self-proclaimed movie !!
