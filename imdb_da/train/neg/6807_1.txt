Spoilers? Maybe a few details, but nothing for plot related. Not as it would have with this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage is blatantly out of the middle of the Executive Decision's infiltration premise. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commands that carry baggy black shirts, which we can only imagine, should hide invisible body arms as their idiotic tactics (similar to what 3rd grade users play Star Wars in the playground ) leads them to absorb a shotgun. <br /> <br /> What told me most about this flick was the use of look-like has been actors. You immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie you really liked, even though it was so long ago that you probably couldn't put it (it was Porky's). Here Cyril plays a decent swearing of a Bill Paxton character. Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard, who is so bold that you will never recognize him as TV's Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past Gerard us an acceptable performance of the crusty fat fat hard guy persona, who was clearly imagineered for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a good hybrid look-like performance like a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type. In the ten years since New Jack City, Ice-T's acting has worsened remarkably. It doesn't work as much as regurgitation of lines that he may have actually remembered. <br /> <br /> One of the things in this movie is a classified information CD. It is carried by the hand, and apparently and incredibly unencrypted, despite the security-conscious aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke. I strongly doubt that the information stated on the CD will ever be collected in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed aircraft with no muffler, the shot is about as high as the canister air and causes a person to do so, apparently no budget. The assortment of selected weapons is quite fun. The aviator's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. When she's intuitive about the mini-uzi gun, which must be one of the worst gun designs ever, it's just too stupid. A true elite team would wear MP-5s for this type of thing or maybe SOCOMM .45's or even customized Hi-Powers if they were really old school or maybe some UN 5.7 if new school ... Lame-o The standard 92Fs problem is amazing as they have lost most of their cool after deadly weapons I. The evil, probably experienced soldiers of wealth types, have a blend of absurdity like the aforementioned mini-uzi gun and a Tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was a handshake of realism that I would like to correct the other reviewers: The Flight Assistant and Ice-T lowered the vessel to 10,000 feet for "breathable air" before opening the door. And I also got the impression that the air traffic controller couldn't get the door closed, that she just gave up at that time. As far as the landing was concerned there was no mention of flaps until approx. 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only Dukes of Hazard who excludes Roscoe P. Coltrane on "pass" could be ashamed of this movie for stock footage. Of course, they chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they couldn't get stock on an F-117. Apart from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let us also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of B-2, and that in a glossy assortment ... Well, I am not an expert, but I doubt if it would be invisible on Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the repeated references to "F-15s" as they showed F-16s were ridiculous. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put so few passengers on a 747 at first, not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wires. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch it on stars or something. Don't pay to rent it, but watch it laugh. In doubt about the worst movie ever, right up there with No Holds Barred, who at least had some originality.
