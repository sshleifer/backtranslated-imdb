When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has gone off with her own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to read his story about the road - only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: The Infinite Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Ben doesn't take it well, and there are many complications - including Ben's attempt to get Norman to be gay by fixing him with a hooker (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this is description of the film sounds much more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written to the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... IS IT YOU? was an absolute disaster on the New York scene. In fact, to get the game into constitution, I saw it in the 1970s as a community theater production - and while no one would accuse it of being anything but a low farce, the game played so widely and in such a deadly way that it turned out to be entertaining. It's a shame that the movie of this movie didn't do the same. <br /> <br /> This is a malicious movie. Red Foxx, one of the most hilarious comics in the 20th century, is as fun here as yesterday's wash, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the TV series HILL STREET BLUES for much better effect) competes with Foxx to watch who can give worst performance and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; The truth is being told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and a cameo of Wayland Flowers have some sparkle - and unfortunately it is only in comparison to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Not only is the movie badly done, it looks bad. According to film lore, this was the first major screen shot filmed in videotape, which was then transferred to celluloid for project purposes - and believe me it shows. The movie looks on a bad 70's sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad they get funny, but NORMAN ... IS YOU? is not one of them. I can sum up my reaction to this movie in two words: miss it. Don't buy it, don't let it rent, don't touch it with a ten foot coil. Just back slowly and then run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
