There is something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numbers' because somewhere inside the Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to jump out. But when the credits roll, there is no one saved it. It's all blown by history's "cop page", where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's murder-detective characters interfere with an awkward sexual affair that is becoming more and more trivialized, the longer movies go on. Although Bullock is strong in its role, saving the noisy script and lazy pacing isn't enough. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in an unforgettable role (he did much better earlier this year in the undervalued 'Birthday Girl') and Chris Penn, who has a role so incredibly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Yet the plot is not even a factor in this movie at all. The two teenagers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry work quite well, and they play well together. It's too bad that they weren't in a much better all-round movie. Barbet Schroeder comes to the ground too safely for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom line: It is worth renting if you are a gene subject, but everyone else will live a lifetime without seeing it, except perhaps on network TVs with convenient commercial breaks.
