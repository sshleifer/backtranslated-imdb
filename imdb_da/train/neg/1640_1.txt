This movie was missing ... everything: history, acting, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes I stared at the screen and said, "How could all these guys meet and consider friends (even without the girl)?" Another fifteen minutes in, I prayed for as much Amanda Peet as possible. When a bad movie stands still, it is ugly head, eyelash is a good consolation. But there wasn't much of it! Cheated on all fronts!
