First of all, I agree with a lot that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His material supply of interesting counterpart is what makes the man a hit on the university's campus circus. He comes across uniform, modest and pragmatic. He does not meet the current political style (unpleasant bi-partisanship) and he puts his sights far and to the right, chastising both for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is a dud. In fact, I wouldn't even call this a documentary, but rather just a collection of speeches. Seeing "Rebel Without A Pause" is no different than watching a speaker on a 3-moon tape wallpaper segment on the CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no story. <br /> <br /> Technically, production is strictly amateurish. The sound is horrible and inconsistent; Sometimes we cannot hear Noam speaking, other times we cannot hear the questions posed by those present. When Noam rarely speaks, we see the audience's reactions, except when we get a quick shot of his wife, who apparently participates every one of his talks and beams with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie and would say you're probably better off checking out your taped tapes on the cassette or CD to listen to in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a generous mood today.
