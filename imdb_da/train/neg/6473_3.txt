As a child, the first installment ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so again I saw this movie for the first time. I think this movie was like most followers and did not exceed their original. I think I might feel this way because I had high expectations and I'm an adult. However, it's not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eursela's sister) so they build a large wall around their house, which is on the ocean. As Melody grows up, she begins to wonder outside the walls where she is forbidden to walk. Problems arise when Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away any movies so you have to watch it out. I liked that the voices are the same and again wonderful song. I think it's a good family movie, even though it's superior!
