Belmondo is a tough policeman. He goes for a big-time drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a big villain - see "Sharky's Machine", but here he is clearly called, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the busiest places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, picks up some people, gets the names, goes to unclear places, asks for more names, beats more people, etc. The whole movie is a blow after a blow. It seems that the people who did so had no other ambition than creating the French equivalent "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 here, does some good stunts at the beginning; Apart from them, "Le Marginal" is a fierce, episodic, tired, low and forgettable cop movie. (* 1/2)
