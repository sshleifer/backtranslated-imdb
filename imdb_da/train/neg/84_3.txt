As a child I thought the weapon the killer needed was cool, but I was a child and then I was a little stupid. Even as a stupid child, the movie plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer did not use his light knife to kill people. What surprises me is that the film has a really solid cast in it. Which script did they read when they agreed to be in this movie, as it is certainly boring and only a means of displaying a light saber on a very small scale. The reason is sometimes incomprehensible, and the end is completely chaotic. The whole movie seems to revolve around aliens and one weapon. The plot has two children and some guys have a strange meeting, flash years later, and there seems to be a return as it was in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored, and for some reason, one guy gets aliens' weapons and continues to use it to go on a very easy killing spree. Seriously, just wonder why this movie was made, if you need a killer, have some good death scenes, if you want stranger meetings more than a strange light vortex thing, and if you have bright saber so call yourself even star wars.
