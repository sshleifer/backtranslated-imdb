The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comical. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out. In fact, I've seen better trading in low budget porn. Although I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Look at your ass Nick: You see your (together): I don't want to leave you! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence shows how horrible the production is, but it's really fun: good loved ones have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 sub-weapons. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And so to put it all out, they do some weapons that switch between scenes with a few M-16s !! I think they had a budget shortage for weapons, not enough to walk between the good guys and the bad. Battle scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as hell. You must remove the pin / spoon from a grenade so that it can explode on its own. You can't burn a shoulder launched missile of any kind while driving inside a helicopter. Weapons that you throw away do not suddenly appear again. When a gun is out of bullets, it's still stupid to throw it away. Unless you have no idea how to reload them. Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes. I really can't believe that movies like this are actually produced. This movie would be fun on nitric oxide or maybe just full.
