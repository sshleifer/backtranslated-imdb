Anyone who has seen 'Shine', Scott Hicks movie of the hearty yet gratifying life of pianist David Helfgotts; I will certainly realize that the 'SOLOIST' is very poor in comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five pauses corresponding to emails just to wake up). The view of the homeless area far above the peak and extremely self-reliant, on equal footing, I fear with the horrible beach scene in Joe Wright's Second Disaster Attonment. .J Fox performance was an extremely bad example of acting and lacking credibility from offset. Downey on the other hand; Although it is struggling with a bad movie, still manages to charm, it is me or he becomes George Clooney in more ways than one?). However, comparing both of these well-known so-called 'STAR'actors' is unnecessary, as the light that shines most sharply in relation to acting must be that of 'shine's' Geoeffry Rush, which is brilliant performance, absolutely SHONE much brighter in my sky. With both 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for the subject's empathy. Read the book and the articles or wait until the DVD is bound to be in the basement soon.
