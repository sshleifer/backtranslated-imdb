Whatever Guy Ritchie had to reuse Wertmuller's movie, it is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw it, and she walked about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I held up to the end was because I never went out of a movie. <br /> <br /> However, I passed through this piece of counter thoroughly flabbergastet that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they were making a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, the play is terrible and the only thing beautiful in this movie is the landscape. Ritchie took Linas movie and transformed it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie you wouldn't even waste time watching late on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on shit as such.
