I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It rained and didn't want to wait for the gate. So I walked across the street and saw my life's worst movie. It was so bad that I chose to stay and watch the whole movie, I haven't seen anything else so bad since. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I was only because I couldn't believe it .........
