I love low budget movies and had great hopes for this. But this movie is static. Don't forget the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the pacing is fatal. Admittedly, these people achieve a lot with little, but the film fails at the most basic level. It's boring. Editing is glacial and pacing stalls. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, which is not seen nearly enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we must suffer from dithering Baltimore-Brits originating through endless and tiring exhibitions. It feels like a backwater scene game for video. <br /> <br /> Noble efforts by everyone in the production, but a story that tired, in need of a kick in the pants and funky new low-budget technology should have given it a fresh voice. Instead, it's just a lame retread.
