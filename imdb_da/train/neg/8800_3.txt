A collection of deleted scenes and alternate takes, edits along and with added voice-over to make it take place after the events of the first. Pretty cool idea, but deleted scenes are left on the rock floor for a reason and this is additional evidence. Since it's just not as fun as "Anchorman" and really let's see it, the movie wasn't exactly comedy gold, so you get a movie worse than someone who was moderately funny. In my eyes, there is still one or two notches over "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched". Spice up your fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to old school form (no saying is calculated) <br /> <br /> My character: D
