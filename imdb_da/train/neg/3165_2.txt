this movie was horrible. I thought with all those some decent actors it would be better. don't waste your time Eva Longoria Parker was horrible. she had to stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes B-actress. The mess he made in the movie, I could never be your woman was the epitome of what I say. and the lake bell she was adorable but definitely needed some more actors. look like heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a bit better. or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful for not wasting your precious time. PS I love you is also a good one from beyond the grave romance! Time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listening to the people who have already seen it.
