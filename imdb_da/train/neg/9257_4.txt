If you are hoping for something new, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual representation of its predecessors can be good. Perhaps the producer and perhaps the director were, but hopefully they were not serious when they did this. This whole movie is like making a biggest hit DVD from the 1. 3 movies, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
