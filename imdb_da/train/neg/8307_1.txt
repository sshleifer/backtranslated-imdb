This show is incredible in it. . . what it represents and what it focuses on and. . . Words cannot describe how crazy ET is. They will report something. If a celebrity itself is externally indirectly associated with the story, ET reports on it. If a dog pok in Tom Cruise's farm, they will report it. If a celebrity dies. . . They will talk about it for weeks at the end of the point where the public envies the celebrity. If a celebrity is trying. . . ET will report it to MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this show will report and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story. Is it even considered legitimizing reporting? The reports are so badly annoying also with hard-hit voices and ending with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can't see this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is a big reason, I avoid pre-evening shows in general. I regret that IMDb can only allow at least one star rating and not zero or even the negatives. For this show -10 Stars deserves.
