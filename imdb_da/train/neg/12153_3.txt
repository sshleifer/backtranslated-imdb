Feeding The Masses was just another movie that tried to make some money out of the zombie going around, mainly because of the popularity of films like Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a television station monitored by the military and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to confinement, and the city will soon be free to do their business again. The problem is, this is completely false. Zombies are running violently, and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them are torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), chief anchor (who for some reason is listed as Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Torch and sherry are against lying to the people, but the station is run by secret service (or another governmental body) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This movie gives a pat on the back of the box cover saying "We keep FEEDING THE MASSES at a higher level than any of the three 'of the dead' films by George A. Rombero. " The source of this quote has lost ALL credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is bad. I don't mean bad as I expected more (I was of course myself), but I mean bad because I couldn't find any redeeming qualities in the movie at all. The action in all parts is either over finished or for wood. Do anyone remember their lines or do they read cue cards? I can't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor / actress. There really wasn't one. If I had to nod someone, I'd say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but it doesn't really say much. I have to recommend forwarding this movie, despite the box cover looking pretty good (that was what originally drew me to the movie). 3.10
