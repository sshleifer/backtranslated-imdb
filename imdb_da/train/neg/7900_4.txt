The titles create chaos in a peaceful little desert town. It's pretty much the plot for this movie, and while the scenes devoted to the Munchies themselves are some fun (in a low-key way), the rest are just fillers and bad fillers. From the "deer", who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, to the stupid city master, it's hard to choose the most annoying character in the movie. There were times when almost everyone was on the screen, and I thought, "OK, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to do the rest of these morons?". The film is also full of pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it already dated from the early 90s. (* 1/2)
