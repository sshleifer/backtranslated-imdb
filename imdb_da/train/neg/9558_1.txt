I thought this was a successor of some sort, and it is supposed to be the original from 1983. But a sequel does not take the original plot and destroy it. <br /> <br /> I actually had very few expectations for this movie, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. No excitement - I actually feel clairvoyant, bad acting and so full of technical errors, so I as a computer nerd just couldn't believe it. They have tried to make it a mix between a generic war film and 24 hours. But this is not even worth a low budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Instead, get the original. The theme is still valid. Do not allow too much power into a machine. And the play and the plot are far more exciting and convincing.
