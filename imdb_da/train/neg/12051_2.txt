This film is "riveting", but in the same way a car crash. It's hard to see away. Overall, this movie is no more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and an involuntary, biased experiment in it. The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no trouble going to the lowest possible denominator. The way the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intermediate steps that the filmmakers force Ted to attend (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the posteriors of filmmakers and further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and apparently cut off completely from the subject they had followed so close to months before. If they had looked after, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they should have let him spend the money without any intervention. This movie is at best a Jackass stunt with high brow and not a documentary. It's sad to think how much $ 100,000 could have changed a homeless person's life if it had been put in the right hands.
