This solid little horror movie is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is pretty routine, but the atmosphere is what really makes it alive. In fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the prison setting itself, and Renny H. saves no detail to show us how bad the conditions are within the crumbling, delicious, rat-infected old hellhole (with a sadistic cherish too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by of some very authentic looking prisoners (there are no beautiful boys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this one out.
