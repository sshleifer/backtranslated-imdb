Don't let the name of this movie fool you. In fact, the Jake Speed ​​character is perhaps the stupid action hero ever known to film. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgins from evil madmen, which he is often not, he is seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to its charm, but in my opinion an action hero has not managed to "chill out" when he gets the chance. In addition, this man, unlike other bold heroes, who usually have an impressive list of talents, has no one unless of course you call to sleep a talent. In any case, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub-par and the action, when something is, is very paralyzed. (The machine guns on the jeep were not bad, but it's about it). So, if you are in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, this piece is perfect for you - it has a hero who is not only asleep but also his audience.
