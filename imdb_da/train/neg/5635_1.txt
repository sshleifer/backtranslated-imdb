I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I wasted a few hours in my life, actually watching this movie, I still can't believe I managed to see it in its entirety. Was there actually a point in the movie, and the end, yes, I'm glad I never paid to watch this horrible pointless piece of pathetic excuse for a movie! I'm not sure without jumping out facts but is Dafoe married or seeing the horrible actress in this movie in fact if it was an attempt to start his career? If it is so scared of it, it must have failed .. <br /> <br /> I send this in hope I can actually put someone away from watching this movie, even though 1 person takes into account my comments and decides that they would rather see paint drying, I will feel that I have done something good in the world if I had just had the same advice ...
