The reasons to see this knock out ... er ... tribute to a great movie called the Se7: - It's on while your channel is surfing and there's nothing else on it. - Someone pays you to see it. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a service and pop in the DVD to the Se7, rent it, download it on iTunes, or put it in your Netflix cue and skip The Flock completely. Flock the same story with a few changes. In addition, editing just prepares the Se7 and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. The worst is probably flying over desert helicopter shots, with the sounds of people chattering over the radio unless there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one. Bottom line: I call it a blatant copy. If you want to be good, you can call it a tribute film, move on, but on the one hand you can see Se7en.
