This is the last time I rent a video without checking into the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such waste as out of sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a fine actor and it is a pity that he was involved in such a bad movie. There is frequent confusing editing that seems to be a last minute decision to make up for the lack or the story, the movie and just common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What did they think?
