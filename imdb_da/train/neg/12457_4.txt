It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the protagonists. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the film cannot hold things together because of poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and one too dark, for boring filmography. I would say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie is hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
