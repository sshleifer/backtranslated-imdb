Made the unfortunate mistake of watching this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well shot from the start, but that's the last positive comment I have about the movie. The action was horrible, I wonder if the actual gogo girls were hired? But that was the plot that was really ridiculous. In fact, it was ridiculous and not boring, the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers during **. <br /> I just want to mention some of the scenes that really made the audience laugh: <br /> <br /> Shoving the girl in the field: who would have thought that a child shooting one another child could be acted so badly. A real eye-opener. <br /> <br /> Getting on the bus scene: The girl arrives on the bus. But according to the music, the world ends. <br /> <br /> The rolling under the clothesline: Wow, this one really shows the plot writer's skills. In the living room followed by raw meat and skill sales. Why not just get her to do all three sins at once? At least then the film could have been a little shorter. Drive down the stairs of the mall: See when one of the girls goes to flight down the stairs followed by a meat that eats Dau, do not wait. She * is * just going fast and trying not to break her nails. <br/> <br /> It ran out of blood: this is definitely my favorite scene and end of the movie. A half-marathon in red paint, completed by vault up the stairs and across the bridge, only to be sent flies most unrealistically by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is performed by the most self-confident girl in the movie, now it stays in character for you. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was created by a 16 year old and their friends. Unfortunately, I have met the director in the presentation, but that is not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic mood and want to laugh with some friends ... even think about it.
