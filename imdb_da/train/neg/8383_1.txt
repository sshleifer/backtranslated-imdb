...Ever. This is the bottom. I'm not funny. The theater should have had a warning of some sort. "Leave all hope you come in here," would have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> I don't have the words that exactly describe hell that this movie is. Its debilitating stupidity even avoids entertaining. This movie is certainly aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched as Mr. Fantastic for 90 scary painful minutes. I remember when Wayans was fun. I think Hollywood's pressure to produce produce produces the blame for the poop that churns out at a uniform rate. I'm sad and offended that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in-the-ball jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon. I didn't like almost anything about this movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but the baby is actually a midget with Marlon Wayan's face slightly overlaid over the midget's body. What I thought was the end. Not the resolution of the movie, but the real end where we all got up and went out. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a star, but it clearly deserves less. I don't feel that the six minutes they used in writing the script are worth a star. This deserves a raid, and I pray to God, it gets it. <br /> <br /> When should people learn to learn; If you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop pooping it out. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You have been warned.
