"A Guy Thing" is trying to capture the feeling of "There is something about Mary" or "Meet the Parents", but comes out more as it was edited out of the ancestral denials of these two films. Fortunately, I rented it on a 5-day rental because I couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. The principle is decent, and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover Paul's breach (the checker at Save-Mart was great), but the manuscript is horrible. The dialogue falls flat for the most part, and just when you think things are finally on track, some inevitable sight-gags are stuck without good reason. Plus how many toilet jokes does a movie really need? <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, slapstick humor is great when it's cleverly done as in the other movies I mentioned, but this movie just lacks the mark. Too bad since I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you were great), but even that couldn't help me sit through this horrible movie. Save your dollars and rent "There is something about Mary" again.
