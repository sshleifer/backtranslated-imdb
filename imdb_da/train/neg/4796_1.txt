I love John's Saxon in something he is in. One time he takes the camera over, even though he heads a movie that should have been more appropriately titled "Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called: Zombie Death House". The $ 1000 Dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Ray's tricky way to make you spend $ 14 on a filmed dump combed by a huge 70-cheese legend. Ray is the promoter of RetroMedia. Ray, by the way, makes the Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Just bad now, they both - and boring beyond. It's great that Ray is digging up these old things, and in some cases it's the public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters, but in the case of the Zombie Death House - the word "Zombie" even whatsoever add ownership and interest from the side of FOR) The only way to service this trip is to release it on the DOLLAR MARKET FOR CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OF SAXON !!! If you want to see true Saxon, get Black Christmas, nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
