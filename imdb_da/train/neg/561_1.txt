Well, I saw this movie yesterday, and unfortunately it is worse than you could think. First of all, the plot is idiotic, it has no meaning at all. The play is full of deliberately fun dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And the excitement is very low. Actors play unevenly, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments, but also some terribly bad plays. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want to * beep * you" and it looks like, let's say it carefully, a very very mature woman who seems rude and not sexy at all. The erotic tension from BI1 is completely gone. From the technical point of the Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical direct to DVD, but on a much lower arm than the original movie. For example, the crazy joyride scene is bad. The Director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven, and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is made by people who are not match for Joe Eszterhas. There is no replacement for Michael Douglas in it. The movie seems to be cheap and poorly edited at times. I'm sorry, but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why haven't they made this movie before and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" Everything for the whole original movie is like Citizen Kane in relation to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthrough in the popular movie theater. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone achievement in his career. It had this particular Paul Verhoeven style. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentional fun movie, poorly directed and a safe Razzie prize winner in many categories. It's a shame they made this movie.
