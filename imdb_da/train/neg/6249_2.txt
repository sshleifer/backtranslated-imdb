(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is a good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (doing what you want): the opening theme. It must be the coolest theme music of any dubbed Japanese television show made for consumer-oops-me-the-youngsters. Unfortunately, there was a need to add some sort of show after the opening theme. And they just couldn't come up with anything more interesting than people who argued loudly about who the cards are better than the others' cards. Freud wanted a field day, unfortunately I can't imagine why any kids want to sit through a show where dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the time. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your skinny Pyramid Diamond Animal into a single strike! Can't you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, you're fooling? ! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! " <br /> <br I am using my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card that destroys every one of your Power Munchers and makes your uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond All Significance Attack useless! bet you didn't see the one coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they ever do in this show, talk. While in another crappy kids show that I used to see, the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (every football mother's pet error), The monsters were at least polite to pull it out every time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is just in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange review, "plain talky and drilling." Not to mention long-lasting (I am realize that I'm hypocritical here considering the phrase I just wrote. <br /> <br /> This show continues forever, I don't know if there's any plot and the static monsters have no character of Pokémon Even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a child, this show sucks in. It's unintentionally fun, but not fun enough to be worth watching, goodbye, sleep well, dream wet dreams.
