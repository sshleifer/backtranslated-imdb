This movie was as stupid as The Naked Gun (which should be). Case in point: <br /> <br /> 1. To fall her drowning, Roberts secretly takes swimming lessons at YWCA. After her "death", YWCA calls her husband to work to give their compassion. HELLO how did they get their work number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving the city, she releases her wedding ring on the toilet. Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in John. Does that mean the toilet was never washed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given as to how she pays for her mother's care in the guest house (when she left behind her RICH husbands). <br /> <br /> 4. Towards the end of this tired movie, Roberts suspected her husband is in the house. Instead of driving for her life, she goes to the kitchen instead of seeing if the cans are stacked nicely.
