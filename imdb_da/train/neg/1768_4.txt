This is another of the movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cats who kill to live etc. - A kind of variation on the vampire concept. The thing that makes it all fall apart is the total ruthlessness of the main character. Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - see how long it took to catch Unibomber and that was because a family member devised it. <br /> <br /> However, children (and to a lesser extent the mother) behave as if they were motionless. The child kills without a thought not to leave evidence or a trace or a living witness. How these people managed to be alive and undiscovered for a month is incredible, let alone decades or centuries. It's really a shame - it could have been so much more if it was written plausibly, ie. gives the protagonists the level of health they would need to pass by for so long. <br /> <br /> Other than that, not a bad view. I loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time I put food on the porch and watch our cats suddenly hurry in from where they were before, I think of that scene.
