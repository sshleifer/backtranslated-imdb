This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book that is being destroyed by a movie. Jacob I've loved is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no story, plots disappear, and editing is horrible. To top it all, the music is from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly horrible. Bridget Fonda's play is decent, but everyone else's plays are completely amateur. I would suggest this movie to a person studying to be a producer as a study of how not to produce a movie, as it is chock full of bad cut photos, bad transitions and plays that should have resumed! Read the book and don't waste your time with this movie.
