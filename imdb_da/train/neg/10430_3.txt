There are many good things about the new BSG: There are several Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6, for example, as the two actresses played excellently. There is the old school experience of industrial design aboard the Galactica ("My ship will not be connected via my dead body!") Also all the spacecraft, the special effects (although the spicy sci-fi watcher will recognize the comic strip of the whole) character darkness, their essentially flawless nature. <br /> <br /> It makes it even more bitter that the ending was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes in the room, raid on cylons and all that was very good. But the lush end? I always watch movies and show these days with the timer hidden so I never know how much time is left for the end. So for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen again and again. Every time I thought oh this is the last scene, the final shot I got one more. Every grading character got its complete end! It wasn't really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really highlighted the school boy's amateurity of it all: The young Roslin scenes. Why is it important for us to know: {a} she lost her sisters and father in a terrible accident, and {b} that she has a night stand with a former student / student? What brings it to the story? Where was the connection? Now I'm all for a more European-ish style approach, and a random act of whateverness in movies and shows, and all that, but it was just ridiculous. This has not meant anything to the story. <br /> <br /> I've also seen "Last Fransin Special" and in that Ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot: he couldn't come up with a good ending to the story, so .... he just didn't do it ! It's never as much about the characters as they did the last episode. The whole "this was thousands of years earlier", the idea of ​​mitochondrial Eve, was also used in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and believe in me, there are many BSG observers who know the particular H2G2 story. And talking about Hera, now there is a story that didn't work well at all. Instead, we get Roslin doing his former pupil, who is 20 years younger. Don't make me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. The more power they have. But this ... has just not made sense. All in all (the writing in), this series is as flawless as they intended its characters to be. It just makes sense for the last episode. I hope Lost and 24 do better with their series final.
