Okay, I remember seeing the first one and boy sucking it. After seeing it, I just shot it and told myself, "Oh, I'm just another low budget B movie. I never see part 2 for this." Then came about 1 1/2 years later, part 2. It sucked even more. But I just laughed about it again and said: "There is no way I will ever see part 3 on this one." Then came about three and a half hours later. I was stupid enough to rent it and boy, I just talked after seeing it. God, I never actually understood how many movies can be sucked these days. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and not rent the whole series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
