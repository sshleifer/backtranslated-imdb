In spite of some occasional original touches, such as the "virtual sets" that give the backdrop to the Victorian interior with Ada Lovelace and its circle, this film falls short and ultimately disappoints. Beginner Francesca Faridany seems talented, but is wasted as Emmy, a character who, by mid-movies, is reduced to nothing more than staring at a screen watching Lady Ada tell an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' starts short when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) performs; The camera lingers on her facial expression, way, and herself apparently makes her transparent or instantly invisible and spreads into scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" representation of her. <br/> <br /> A fair biopic by Ada Lovelace wanted it to be worthwhile, but this movie unfortunately has a hash for both Lady Ada's life and a modern computer scientist (and her broadly-drawn, dolly girlfriend).
