This movie became extremely stupid when things started to happen. I couldn't care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the leading actor (forgetting his name) also came on my nerves. Can't quite remember how it ended, etc. But the whole idea of ​​aliens possessing human bodies and everything just seemed stupid in this movie, things weren't completely gone. My father told me it was some movies ... I should have listened to him.
