Steve Carpenter can't make horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this film. The only decent part was the hot brown hairy girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movie has no gore (usually an important ingredient for a horror movie), no action, no action and no excitement (also an important ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and clean in that it is sad. There were a couple of parts that were going to be fun (continuing teen horror / comedy movies) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought this movie was rated R and I was not aware and realized it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you liked that I still know what you did last summer. It is the only type of person who would find this movie, even distantly scary. And seriously, it's for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
