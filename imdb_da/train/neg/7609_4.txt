Being a big fan of Corman's horror movie, I expected from his western little more than I got. Well, I was entertained, okay. I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles. <br /> <br /> See the play of mobile tire tracks on the priest in the old west. You can kill time by counting them if an otherwise dull scene is on the way. And the horses also seem to have gear in them, considered the fast-forward hunters. See also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west salon making a number reminiscent of a particular fashionable dance from the 1920s, here decades before the style was invented. Hope the salon around them will not crumble. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, the main players are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all really fine. A special praise for them to do the best they could with the material that apparently has been lifted from 'Johnny Guitar', but not quite impress in the same way. But there really is nothing wrong with a ridiculously western one like this. Like a really bad old horror movie, it may fail in a way but still manages to bring joy. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work appeals to me, and so I dare recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance.
