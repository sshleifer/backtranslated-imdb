Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in her mouth blowing her back off her boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a "devil and dead" rock band who could not shake the boring feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her (you know I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than to put a ball through my head) . She returns, but possesses the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend who will replace her on vocals, so that the group can finish the album that is stopped by Cassidy's early death. But Cassidy made a deal with the dark, and souls have to be collected. She is consumed by this anger against mostly Neal, but all band members or anyone in the music studio are dying when they fall in exchange for whom they think is a rather distraught Dora..not Cassidy returns to payback. <br /> <br /> Miserable micro budget horror flick looks cheap, has a cheap cast that plans in another style and boasts cheap kill scenes that are a bit effective.
