The guide described the basis of SEVERED TIES as such: "An experiment on a cut arm goes wrong" so immediately I thought it was an arm that has a mind as it is seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE fingers or hand or someone gets an arm transplant like body parts. Both rooms have been tested or tested more accurately and tested, so I was curious about how manufacturers would approach history. In fact, I thought they made an arthouse movie like PI down for the use of B&W photography at the beginning of the movie, but the creators seemed to be tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy match. to THE EVIL DEAD. I have very little to say about this, except that I didn't like THE EVIL DEAD movie and I didn't like SEVERED TIES, and it seems really unfair that movies like this use an indecent amount of rubber when the third world cries for condoms
