I've been using IMDb for years, and I've never wanted to get involved in the comments from movies ?? until now. This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic study expert, but I know enough to shed light on the obvious one-sided view this documentary belongs to. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie begins with being a documentary. Most of the documentaries I have seen relate to a few valid points and surround these points with debatable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: What the West should know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslim, but building a documentary about the whole of Islam about a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This really is a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. For those who want to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary, there are several points that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but several Muslims live outside that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Qur'an used in the documentary is a questionable one. I watched the documentary while I was watching another translation, and the differences were striking. I had been warned about the translation used in the documentary, and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Surrah says that unbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I've read instead: "Those who reject the truth among the book's people and among the polytheists will be in hellfire." The difference is that those who reject truth are the people who know God and the truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but that is not true. Although it is true that much comes from the Qur'an and hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called urf or normative behavior. Clearly, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but "Urf is supposed to be" good "behavior, what an average person would consider right or wrong. The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic law) as a whole Knowledge of the knowledge that all Muslims follow: this is simply not true, there are many Islamic law schools and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> Hadith tradition is There are thousands of hadiths, and every law school accepts some and rejects others.Use Hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real and useful, suddenly choose and choose quotes from the story that fit what you want "That's what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot abortion clinics and so on I know this is not the same as suicide bombing, just understand that fundamentalism is just the problem. If you feel you have the answer, then everyone else should be wrong. But if you feel you have an answer, you can work with others' views on politics, religion, God or anything.
