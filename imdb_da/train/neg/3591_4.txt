First of all, let me say that I am a great believer in Fanpro stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a soft spot for fanpro stuff, which means I will overlook things that I would normally change badly. <br /> <br /> So on to ST: HF. Well, first of all the good things. Enthusiasm is a big part of making any show credible, and for the most part the crew of the various ships seem to have a good time with their roles. Then the effects are not bad for a home brewing effort, with nothing to make you win. The stories are not bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough and at least there are history arches. <br /> <br /> But it has many errors. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, although they definitely have HAVE to tear off Star Trek footage, set backgrounds, music and effects, I see no reason why they continued to tear off almost every other sci -For musical scores ever made. Everything from foreigners to Starship Troopers reacts to the orchestral head at some point. Likewise, much of the footage from other movies has made CGI'd over to make it look different. The gray warships, for example, though disguised, are clearly Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the station is also quite obvious Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Likewise, sound effects from various Star Wars movies are shown in space between fighters, as well as animated over recordings. In a scene in either the first or second season, I think you see two TIE fighters flying by themselves during a fight, which hardly makes your suspension of disbelief any favor. <br /> <br /> The act varies from reasonable to terribly painful to see. Everybody improves as the seasons progress, but is expected to ugly on the screen a lot, especially in the early seasons. They also made some interesting choices of action. Let's just say that the food replicators on this show seem to be permanently "cake" and leave it on it. Makeup effects are generally quite effective on the whole. But they should really merciless club to death the person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than background or "passing" shots. They are just beyond unrealistic. Every time I saw one of these (except trying not to laugh too much), I expect the unfortunate soul to wear it to pull a gun and announce that "This is a shit!" In one scene, a "Cardassian" actually speaks while wearing one of these. Not only does the lips move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone has to fight hard for it. Couldn't have taken a knife for the sake of goodness! There are also some well done but unintentionally fun makeup jobs, such as. The Herman Munster parable. <br /> <br /> Although coherent, the scripture is nothing new. Instead, the script runs as a continuation of the DS9, where the ships depart from DS12 on various missions. The new enemy, "The Gray" is not very threatening, and the plot line involving them is effectively a recast of Borg threads. i.e. Starfleet meets Gray, Gray is extremely strong, Starfleet escapes almost with their lives, so through technology they begin to find ways to fight the enemy, etc. etc. Everything has been done previously with Borg. <br /> <br /> Another discussion leg is the dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to write "insert technobabble here" into a script. It usually means an exhibition of the latest plan to fight the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolitic charges", etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you they are on the case and there is a solution in place. <Br /> <br /> The words are just gibberish really. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF makes a mess of it, it is where they contain real comments in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice like "We need to regroup" sounds good, but not when handed out by trio of characters already in a group. Similarly, when asked about the situation, a tactical officer is heard to answer "We expect three battleships". He actually needed to count them? C'mon! I expected the author to ask him "Are you sure?" or "Can you double check". But my all-time favorite comment is this: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Comms officer: "No, we can only send and receive .. <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... Having said all the above, the show gets better, Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better. Season 6 so far looks quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have one problems with their choice of media for the shows Quicktime sucks, frankly and the faster they move to divx / avi format, the better, some of us can actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a little QT window on a computer screen Not only does Quicktime make it difficult, but the 320x180 resolution the viewers are in is not at all clear, in fact, it makes the shows pretty unpacked, just as they were a tenth generation VHS tape copy. to include a hi-res downloadable option. <br /> Anyway, the show has promise, and I even start to like some But there are 40 episodes on so I'm not sure it says much about character development at all. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free .... <br /> <br /> PS: Out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... We saw the same show? Or are you 19 all three-year-olds?
