This film was basically Velvet Goldmine, if the authors of a party of five got hold of it and made it to a tsv. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good acting, writing and basically everything else. The movie had some of the worst writings I've seen since the Wild Wild West. It was absolutely necessary to be interesting. I know that VH 1 has become a house name for their behind the music exhibitions. which is much better than all that would have worked if it was behind the music section, but not and felt flat on that face.
