I knew this movie wouldn't be great, but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought it had potential. Unfortunately, a lot of the film's dialogue was very fake sound and cheesy. I think Aquafresh gave some money for the production of the movie because they seriously lost some hints throughout. There is a shot where the Aquafresh character sticks out on you that you can't help but notice it. Perhaps they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times we can drop Aquafresh products in the film without people being annoyed. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I didn't spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
