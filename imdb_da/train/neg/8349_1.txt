Guy walking without motive ... I will never get back the two hours of my life. The guy continued to accept identities and cheated on his pregnant wife. What did I think? How did it win a prize anywhere? I understood that he loved his father, but apart from that, the movie was completely meaningless to me. What was the purpose of going so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How did his life calculate? Why should we see the dying old lady on her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> Even though it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not recommend the movie itself to leave while you sleep ...
