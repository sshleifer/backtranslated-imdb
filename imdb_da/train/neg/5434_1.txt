Wow. What a horrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few handles. - Screenwriter eliminated two main characters from the book. - The reason has been changed grotesque. - Voiceovers sound as if they were lifted directly from written passages (which can read well, but are not the same when they are spoken, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The action is more wood than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - This should be stated in 1983 ??? Feels more like 2003 ... To be fair, I couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it's possible that it redeemed ... (sarcasm). I really hope no one paid to see this, or at least someone who read the book and hoped for something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be confused by this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
