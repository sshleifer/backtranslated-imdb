if you didn't live in the 90s or didn't listen to rappers ever !! this movie may be ok for you but anyone for any fan or any person who has ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no meaning in the movie where i said it was interesting or i didn't know it. Another thing that bugged me was it made it look like something in his life he did was very easy, there was no fight he made the prison look easy, selling drugs, and even rapping it was not realistic. I think if the movie where it was released for about 15 years from now, it might have more influence maybe !!! Good rap movie congestion and flow, get rich or die trying not infamous
