You realize you've seen the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an island, but you think that having seen immaculate, stink-loaded heroes, suede runs through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade, it would be enough to Get yourself committed to something a little more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the validity of the pointer, as for the post I find questionable. It's just hard to suspend the unbeliever of "Bushy Bill" who eats a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air-conditioned make-shift bio-dome, sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy. <br /> <br /> What is the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their meandering life. I just don't understand that. But if you find yourself imprisoned by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their SANDTE habitat. They call them HOMELESSE PEOPLE, and for free you can sit back and marvel at their creepy ability to retrieve various cigarette residue from an abundance of garbage cans that eventually "pay-dirty" and form a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer stick, while constantly begging people to change food when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Like Survivor, every member of the tribe sends "Blade" "the Island" when they are unknowingly sent packing to the local institution when the scary unmedical state of full blown schizophrenia is in gear! Now it's entertainment!
