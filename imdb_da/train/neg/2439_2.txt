"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch slasher-flick gives something to do and lots of absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as Professor Bruckner. The action is abysmal, the action is slow and the climax is ridiculous. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He is in a coma for seven years, and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage. "Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series. The murders are funny and the dialogues are painfully stupid. If you are in the right mood, you can give this piece of waste a look. You will laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe in me!
