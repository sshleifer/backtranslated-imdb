Best of the best 4 is better than 3 but just barely. Basically, I say this because part 4 is not contrary to parts 1/2 (as 3 does) (ie their is no reference to Tommy Lee having siblings). At least I liked the history of Russian history, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen's part as Boris. Apart from that and a couple of fighting situations, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the airplane scene). <br /> <br /> Also part 4 doesn't really have a morale or say something like part 3 did, there are a few more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but unfortunately nothing like the beginning of series (and even these characters have very small roles). Unfortunately, it seems best of the best is the Rhee show, and to be truthful, he can't wear a movie. <br /> <br /> Look at tape, Rating: 4
