Two old friends are sent to Japan to get results from a genetic research containing video tapes stolen by the black suitable ninjas at the start of the movie. First, they just need to learn some ninja skills because "only the ninja can beat the ninja." Sakura killers try hard to be fun ninja-flick but fail it badly. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say anything good about it: The same plot has been seen in various variations dozens of times before, the characters are too succinct, the direction is dull, and the script doesn't give anything surprising even at the end the scene, which in itself reduced the film's (rubbish bin) value. <br /> <br /> Even the 80's ninja-flick fan, who understands the aesthetics of trash, is hard to find this movie, even hardly fun. It simply does not offer anything new to the viewer, either at sea level or in plot. Shurik's throws and katanas turn, but it's not enough to direct the film direction, as it was supposed to be, and repeated similar fighting situations, of course, the most callous viewers after the first 30 minutes. It's hard to recommend movies to anyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind Sakura Killer's American ninjas. Even in film, there are no balls and it is a waste of time to try to find some fantastic fighting scenes in this movie: There is no one. All in all, one of the most futile ninja flicks I've ever seen. Is not interested even in curiosity. Trust me on this one. <br /> <br /> Â½ out of 10.
