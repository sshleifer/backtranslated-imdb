There really isn't much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It is harmless enough, but it is a little more than a boring 70s hoist film. The movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be. The reason is a return of the tired old casino robbery story that has been made to death. Except in the case of the Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery was designed by a 3-year-old. The plan involves three women ?? one to unnecessary and on a regular display scale outside the Circus Cicus building, one to serve as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand around and expose her split. That's pretty much it. Intricate, huh? Apart from Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot are not very memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When he does not take Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic weapons battles ever put on film. I really wanted to like this movie. It has the 70s who feel that I always enjoy and some great pictures of Las Vegas around 1975. But the film itself is too boring to judge anything higher than a 4/10 ?? and it probably surpasses it. Ultimately, the Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some very good division.
