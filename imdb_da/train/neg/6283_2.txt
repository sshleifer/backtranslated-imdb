What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You bring a bunch of friends home with you, all hyped about Sean Elli's follow-up work. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, no spoilers who could kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late evening, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes pass and you begin to tell yourself it is bound to pick up, in 25 minutes you start to wonder if you just need to sleep and save this for another time when you fully Out can appreciate the expected, non-existent, subtle touches. During the half-hour selection, you understand that half your mocking audience is already asleep and call it a day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you exhaust any other material to see you, you go back to this, in the middle of the day this time, you hope your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you quickly find yourself moving forward the incredible and unnecessarily long intermediate transitions and pictures. Other things I would have given up already, but there is cashback and its inheritance. But that legacy can only carry you so long, this is a new level of dull film making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> Decent cast is wasted, there is no filmography that leaves you in awe as cashback either. There are movies that annoy you, there are movies that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately it's just a waste of time. Final words, stay away.
