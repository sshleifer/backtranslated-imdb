Now I had to be generous and give this a 2. This was mainly due to the free holes cut in the lady shirt where her breasts are. I found it amusingly fun. Apart from that, this movie does nothing but give a couple of good laughs with a friend. Fun if you're willing to throw "mystery science theater" comments on it with someone, but it's nothing better than a 2. And a 2 pretty much sucks.
