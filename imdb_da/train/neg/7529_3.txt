Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is still one of the worst movies ever made. It has Bruce Lee dying as a result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of ninja knife for the neck bag, but it does not explain how he came to be on a helicopter as the previous scene has him close but not on the helicopter, which is already 200 feet in the air. It just gets absurd from then, as something out of a cheap cartoon. Perhaps the idea is not so cluttered, but it has not been done with some artistry from a filmmaking point of view. There are dozens of such martial arts bombs out there, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre by adding plausible stories to his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are far better than 90 percent of martial arts junk films produced in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of junk cinema, even though Bruce Lee is in it.
