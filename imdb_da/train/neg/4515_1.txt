"Piece is Cake" is the defeatistic, revisionist story of the worst kind, the only point being to unjustly sage the reputation of the (at least fictitious) pilots it portrays. It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth. In March 1989, "Airplane Monthly", Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini series. Some of his comments are worth repeating: <br /> <br /> "There was no sense of defeat at all times in any of the squadrons I saw in action and a total absence of the loutishness that was depicted in 'Piece of Cake'. It would not have been tolerated for a moment ... ... The atmosphere so far was more akin to that in a good rugby club, but with more discipline. There was also no sense of 'death or honor'. Education had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we were obliged to do so - no more and no less. <br /> <br /> "There was no discussion of" courage "or" cowardice. "People had either gut or they did not - but mostly they did, but we knew fear, acknowledged it in ourselves and in each other made our condemnation to control it, and then we continued with the job ... "I couldn't feel any" glory, "but there was a sense of grandeur, and none of them had the slightest resemblance to" Piece of Cake '. "<br /> <br /> Beamont was in his own words" a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and the producer of the latest TV series, was there at that time. "<br /> <br /> Beamont served with 87 squadron both in France and BoB before continuing to become one of the leading exponents of both the typhoon and Tempest, and a post-war test pilot. <br /> <br / > "Piece of Cake" is an absolute total misconception of the way in which Fighter Command pilots acted at that time, nothing less than a complete and complete disgrace ...
