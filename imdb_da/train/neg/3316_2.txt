This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I've ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan, but I still can't get myself to forgive this movie's existence. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a great Jane Austen fan and because of that I've been exposed to various of the classics, Emma is one of them. I've always considered them annoying, stupid, and boring. But after seeing this horrible reproduction, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was lovely and charming. Ewan McGregor rarely serves a purpose in this movie after they hacked and mutilated that part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character, and the rest of the movie is unremarkable and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone who is far interested in English time frame ... see the originals. If you're an Ewan McGregor fan ... believe me, by jumping over this movie, you haven't missed anything other than five minutes collectively by him in a silly hat and a bad hairdresser.
