What a bad, bad movie !!! I can't believe in all the hype that has been lavish on this pretentious, amateur excuse for a real movie !! I left the theater before the end, stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie was !! And to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this movie, when all that is in reality, it's a brazen attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of proofreaders and festivals by being cheap and foggy. <br /> <br /> At least, this movie once showed me that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke, and that this is more of a bad film making brand than anything else. Avoid at all costs. You want your time back! I know I did.
