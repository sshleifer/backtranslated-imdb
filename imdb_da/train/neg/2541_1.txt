Never seen the original movie in the series ... I only hope it was a much better movie than this one or the sequel made in the 1980s, as if it were not, how were these two terrible followers even justified. This movie had a really good link when they advertised to appear at one of the old independent stations that are a past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. However, it was a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of bright fluff with almost no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real observation is close to the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rain, except that there are almost no signs of creature that were really disappointing as a child. The story is basically that the old evil hunters must kill everything they see and are after the creepy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just a random hair guy in the forest who likes to pull randomly through the water . Not really worth looking at, but I would like to see the original when it created what would also make the 80's bad boggy creature, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70s "The Town the Dreaded Sundown" .
