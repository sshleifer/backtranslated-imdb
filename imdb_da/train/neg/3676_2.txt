Susan Swift is an appealing kid, a flower child transplanted to the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but she doesn't quite have the vocal area of ​​a demanding dramatic leadership, and she tends to sing; Still, she is pretty sweet and has bright eyes and a beautiful smile. In "The Coming" (as it was called when it was briefly released to theaters), Swift may be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The ticket is very low budget and borrows from so many other pictures that I gave up with it with approx. 15 minutes to walk. It starts heavily and has a certain bedspread. It is clear that there are more serious films dealing with Salem's witch trials, which deserve to be seen over this one; But as a junk movie, it's not that terrible. The Boston sites are a definite plus and the supportive cast is entertaining hammy. * 1/2 from ****
