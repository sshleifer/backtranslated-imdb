If I could give it less 1 would. Don't rent; if someone gives you the DVD, it burns. <br /> <br /> This is terrible movie production. A total waste of straight digital "movie". I've seen better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys. Lommel claims to have written this, if so, he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story is not present, the dialogue is mainly screaming, the work of the camera is a kind of attempt on artistic flairs with inappropriate cutting of completely independent jumps to either industrial transport scenes or some odd, angry, women's shift. <br /> I can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose of a "creative" movie - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This one is either so far beyond my limited concept of understanding, I missed it or it is completely pointless. I think it's a "let's see if we can get a title that will soon come out and do a weird rift on it and see if we can get some of the money" con jobs. <br /> <br /> I can't see why Lionsgate even bothered with this. Absolutely worthless, it's so bad that I don't want to hire others from the same director.
