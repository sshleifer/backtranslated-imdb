I was very excited to watch this movie and foresee a visual excursion on the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, which contains the kind of wisdom as "rivers and tides". However, that is not what I received. Instead, I get a rather uninspired movie about how human industry is bad for nature. It is clearly a rather unorthodox claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to be in conflict with the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed "ethical" task he has for the workers, who occasionally see the pictures along the periphery. And honestly, the pictures were generally not that impressive. And according to this "artist" the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all respects, a silly movie is. For people who want to feel better about their environmental awareness ... but not to anyone who wants to think about the complexity of the problems surrounding it.
