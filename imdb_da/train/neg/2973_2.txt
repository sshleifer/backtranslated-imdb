I have two very big complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local rental store pays homage to what is clearly a soft core category in the "excitement" category. (Had I known what it was, I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie . No one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two. <br/> <br /> In fact, it makes three major complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. That for some reason I saw the movie long enough to discover second point on this list. Boy, I regret it. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This film is worthless at virtually every level.
