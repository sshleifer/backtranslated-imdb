Based on some of the comments in IMDB, I expected an action movie - perhaps a dramatic or a stupid one or a simple or a comicy, but essentially an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever I looked at, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (though the proletariat is trying to make it seem complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins. <br /> <br /> Now pull the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then just let one of the assassins, the princess, become a villain on a revenge. Add in a rebellion love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still failed to make it a story or movie. Between some random action sequences and some odd pictures trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you are left with is a sense of emptiness. The movie just doesn't feel like a movie, but a strange, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
