You know you're in trouble when the opening story basically tells you who is surviving. It all goes downhill from there. Unnecessary, "Matrix" influenced bullet-time camera work. Only cuts for video game footage. Crusty old sea captains and crazy sailors. Ravers who become talented champions in the blink of an eye. Even the zombies are boring. I was hoping for at least one "so bad, it's good" zombie movie, but this is "so bad, those involved in its creation should be excluded from making a movie again". <br /> <br />
