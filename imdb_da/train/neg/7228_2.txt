The good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top notch set production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> The bad: Terrible mix of actors with all CGI actors blends fifth element with Final Fantasy. The CGI players look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Error Logic. A giant pyramid pops up and no one examines it, nobody asks it right? And there's no explanation why God Horus himself was thrown out, and was there no reason why he should do anything as trivial as impregnating Jill? <br /> <br /> The ugly: <br /> <br /> Horrible script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas not fully realized. The dialogue was almost ridiculous on some points. Random characters and events that are not necessary. Sad characters. Jill was supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the author. There is nothing for her. She is uninteresting and boring to see. She has no fabric, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is no sign throughout the film that has any purpose, any goal (beyond the obvious Horus), any motivation. They are weak and unimaginable. There are no bets - the key to screen writing. Horus doesn't become immortal, but big deal, he's a bad guy. One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill are the main character. That's the problem: the devote half of the movie for each character means that the author never explores quite a character, never brings one to work. They are cardboard cuts that go round and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine sets of pieces. First time director pacing. Slow, slow, slow. I still see the movie as I write this. I can't pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall: <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing. Treadable history, sub-par character development, corny CGI does not save the fine set of production.
