This movie was on the Romance channel and I thought it could be a goofy 80 movie that would be fun at some level, so my brother and I saw it. Boy sucked it. Boy falls in love with girl - correction, his * dream * girl (apparently there is a difference, and I'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl - he was beaten with her from over 30 feet away. to show the power of dreams, a boy ends up being masked as a woman to be near a dream girl (creative in the sense that it is a widespread plan but not creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions you can think of on), difficult situations arise, a fight is made (all it takes seems to take place around late afternoon - either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting, or the actors had to wait until they released their daylight job to get to the set; I suppose the latter). Very clumsy, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * by accident *, so there's really nothing to redeem it. Unless you are interested in seeing Chad Lowe's early days before finally getting his piece tart with his role as the HIV-positive gay guy on the "Life Goes On" series or Gail O'Grady, who was on NYPD Blue and may staring at Dennis Franz hams). But these are unlikely motives - I would say "systematic deterioration of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised I saw it all. I suppose that is the kind of thing where you halfway see yourself * still * looks because of some morbid, self-flagellistic inner problem, and think you might as well end it so you can tell your friends and family That you actually went through such a horrible movie without it giving you any sympathy for the dubious state of your mental health. Can you * take the challenge?
