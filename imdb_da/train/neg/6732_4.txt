I discovered this movie at the IFC and I thought it would be interesting. For "little" love stories, some of the stories have really settled in this movie. That none of these women had names makes you suspect that the actresses talked about their own real sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I must admit that I will begin to see some more romantic views on first sexual encounters again, as in "Strike!" (1998), "when Odette Sinclair's acquaintance began to ask her supposed first time, and Tweety asked" Was it beautiful? "<br /> <br /> Some might think that re-enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think it would make things even worse. but somehow I just expected more.
