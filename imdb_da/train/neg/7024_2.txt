I borrowed this movie because it's not just because of its gay theme, but the idea of ​​role playing really fascinated me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco since I live near SF. And of course it was nice to see shots from the Castro district (although Castro really gives me more to gay man than woman). But apart from that, I can't really recommend this movie. The characters are not really designed for me to break, and when they finally started to come to "role playing", I was already sad. And the role-playing scenes that I saw were a little embarrassing to see. The action leaves something to be desired. Needless to say, I didn't finish the movie. I would skip this one.
