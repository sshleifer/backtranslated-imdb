I don't want to take too much time here, just say Darkman 3 is great. I have all 3 on DVD, these added to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get points. There aren't too many good horrors, thrills out there. Many thanks to the entire crew, and set to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you wonder how I encountered this on DVD. I bought it over the internet, but it is region 4, which you know most American DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player as it is a regional player. Just go to the setup and then select witch position settings (1-9).
