My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which I find quite offensive as I make an effort to judge this movie for other people. Please be tolerant of others' opinion. Of course, writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment altogether. <br /> <br /> I think it's a really bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Topic: One should be very careful about making a film about a philosopher who is not currently understood by the masses, and among peers, passionate discussions bring out. One thing philosophers agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a movie about his life, which, of course, contains his 'ideas', is one thing you should be extremely careful about or don't even prefer. Wisdom begins by knowing what you do not know. One might think that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not an imaginary character. It's about the life of a person who actually lived and had / has great influence on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts on the story itself, but also on the chosen subject, tomato. There is a responsibility for the producers when making a film about actual facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. <br/> <br /> Manuscript: One of the first things I noticed was the ridiculous accents. Why? It derives from what it should be about; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It does not help to put things in a right geographical perspective or time! Come on, do it properly English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got the right part ... to let his characters speak some gibberish aramere in the passion. <br/> Secondly, it is well overcrowded. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to portray Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> 4. The facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. It is a waste of celluloid.
