A young boy enters a lot of money and immediately begins to live it up. Unfortunately, the man whose money is really the case is very bad. He wants his loot back. When he discovers who has money, he starts trying to get it back. He continues to be confused by this young child, who is just lucky enough not to fall into the hands of the evil man. It sounds familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not interesting at all. Come up with something a little different, ok guys?
