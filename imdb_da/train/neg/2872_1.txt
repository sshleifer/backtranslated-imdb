This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If anyone offers this for you for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you stupid to know you saw it. The reason is not even the worst part of this movie ..... its acting, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. Anyone who paid to get this movie made has been broken now. I hope the director never gets a green light for another movie. In the defense, this movie was made quickly to try to exploit the actual BTK killer's catch, but I've seen movies of the weeks that looked like Oscar's winners in relation to this.
