This is one of the worst things ever to come out of England, so it says a lot right there. The excitement when we find out if Lembach remains or not is great. On the upside, the nice secretary Sheila looks at a picnic table under the underwear for a while after being caught by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too, though none of them are good. There is also a point where there is almost a car accident that returns your heart rate just below normal. There is also a clock that is teleported away, and the fear of the woman who does not get her guard back is parallel to "The Sixth Sense" horror much more boring and British. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and Dr. The rat, which results in nothing, plus electro-cutting of many people plus a cat, and you have yourself ... ummm ... A British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good, but not one of them bests.
