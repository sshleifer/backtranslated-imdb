I'm so much forward to this movie. It's a good family movie; But if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better editing work, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes outside the context. I hope there is another movie from the series, they are all very good. But if someone else is made, I ask them to be more aware of editing. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. It is unfortunate because the other films in the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they are both good role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoys a good love story.
