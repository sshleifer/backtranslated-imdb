Primarily; It is very dilettant to try to describe only the history of history from positions of weapons, bacteria and steel. The same attempted to make Marxists from economic positions. <br /> <br /> The cause of Western success cannot be just stupid luck, the benefits of tamped plants and animals. We see that all benefits and bonuses worldwide are completely useless if they are not wisely managed. In Japan, there are no major natural resources, but Japan is one of the world economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, there are only medium-term successes. Both of these nations still have and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a hole? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond stated that it is very important to understand weapons, bacteria and steel factors to understand. Perhaps the main factor for the world's difference is not geography, but people are able to understand and use things? The mental ability to understand. And in this case, geography is only subordinate.
