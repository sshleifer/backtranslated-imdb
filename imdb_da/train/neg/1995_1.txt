Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie and it wasn't even worth it. It seems to be from a bad print and is in the public, I guess. <br /> <br /> Despite its glory, prizes and reputation, Neagle is a domestic British gal who can't sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the fine old Hollywood actors featured here must have thought they did a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neaggen's husband) always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was wrong. She was unlikely popular in Britain before and after World War II. Her "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than her musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few of the famous songs are included and no one is well presented. Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day. At least you get some real comedies and professional style dancing!
