just below the surface is what? a simple horrible movie is what. <br /> <br /> As other viewers have rightly commented, the storm sequences are simply ridiculous. chopping already soaked burn in slope rain? Now it's smart. threaten? premonition? sexual tension? for those who read dull and dull and boring and boring and boring and overly constructed. <br /> <br /> I would like to say god to mia sara's shower scene, but gradually I think the movie producers, having seen the finished mess realized they had to put something in to make it half worth at all. so it's just another contrivance. Do yourself a favor and give it a miss.
