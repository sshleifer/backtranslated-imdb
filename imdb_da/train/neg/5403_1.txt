I only gave this movie a single star because it was impossible to give it less. Scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism. In their laboratory (a closed warehouse in L.A.) they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies breaks in to steal the formula, and the rest of the movie is an endless foot hunt. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (a rubber blanket) loosens and starts to dry out. It has the amazing ability to sneak within 2 or 3 feet of a person without noticing them and so quickly biting their head. <br /> <br /> A cast member escapes in a police car and spends the rest of the movie run effortlessly through the city. She has such an overall mental ability that she cannot even operate the radio. She never tries to drive to a subway station or a donut store and appears hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex destroys the whole city, there are fierce gunfights and buildings (cardboard mock-ups) are blowing up, but a single police car, or army, or no one else ever discovers. Such an activity must be common in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a successor is not planned.
