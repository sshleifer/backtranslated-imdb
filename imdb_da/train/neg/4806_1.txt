I don't know what these Brady kids are. First, Barry Williams publicly blames to have sex with his television sister, Maureen McCormick, then to share her television mother, Florence Hederson. Then Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a bunch of porn movies. Then Mike (Bobby) gets the Lookinland trouble in full run. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eva (Jan) Plum may have had the same sex fling on the side. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early 20s under her style at "The Surreal Life", which was initially fun to watch and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship . The last episode where she posed for a bunch of naked photographs with another nude girl for a scrapbook to give Christopher her birthday was not a good move on her side. And he treated it in a very mature way, just pick up and leave to clear his head. I think he always bowed to her every need, and now he takes a final position. And I hate to say so, but I think she is abusing him orally. The way she plotted him for an engagement ring and the way she reamed him for every little thing. She also speaks openly about having flutes with other women, and it is obvious that she is still sleeping on him with women and men, which is not something that self-respecting people should do when they are already married to someone. If it were a man who spoke down to his wife like that and went out every night and attached to other people, every rally would leave behind the wife to leave him. Why would it be different. What started out as a cute little crush on another reality show flourished into an enormous disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan who clearly need a therapy because she cries like a baby over so many stupid things. I'm sorry for her, but Chris has to get rid of her because he's a good man who can't afford to be humiliated like this.
