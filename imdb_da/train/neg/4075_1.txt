I am a horror / gore movie freak and this flick was so bad I felt embarrassed not only by the "actors" but also the director and the bad sap of a producer who actually put the money up for this schlock. /> <br /> From the title you would expect some great bloodbath, some of a story and at least some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I laugh at the three stooges. As I looked at this crap, I switched another TV and started to see Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was watching Stern. <br /> <br /> Watch this "movie" I realize I could produce a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration for entering non-budget film production. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is a lot of nothing in here, but a lot of talk and very little action. This makes "KaZaam" a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany doesn't ban it because of sex or violence. Other countries must be aware of.
