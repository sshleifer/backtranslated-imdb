This movie was horrible, simply put. It was so bad that I was registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I'm a campy horror movie expert in itself. I've seen "Redneck Zombies", "House of the Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> Three quarters of the movie consists of frightened people running from one side of the screen to the other. When they do not run, they are spouting non-sequitur lines, without emotion or motivation. When the players begin to be acceptable, the direction falls. There were so many disappointing low angle shots; I figured Leif Jonker had a 3 foot high stand. He used what I call "Leif Maneuver" several million times: that is to zoom out from an object of interest as an amateur. Apparently, the movie staff couldn't get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset ... and played it the other way around. In the direction of this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene. All you can expect is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) gory movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the basic "Dead Alive." If you're a shocked buff and are looking for a challenge, give "Darkness" a ride. <br /> <br /> The quote o 'movie - <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's death!
