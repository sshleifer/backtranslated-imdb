Geez, as a gay man living in NYC, I can thankfully say that I have never seen the genius of gay culture portrayed in this movie - and I love it !!! Was this movie broadcast on TV across the US that would be a great anti-gay backlash and I can't say I would blame them. The people in this movie do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trends American, what they represent is a clean and complete nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is horrible, and the obvious racist feelings (anti-whites) are blatant and disturbing - society cannot be caused by people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and the rejection of education from the film's "cast" - the These folks Actions are not desperate actions, but rather a rejection of something resembling personal ambition and a willingness to do something out of oneself.
