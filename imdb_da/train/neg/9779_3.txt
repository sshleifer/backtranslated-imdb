Ruthlessly stupid, non-budget "warfare" made the most of the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but it should be a nuisance to all of them. Laughable "script", performances that would not pass patterns in a primary school's Christmas competition, spooky "action" scenes, confused direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - who apparently is not quite sure whether he is doing a comedy, a philosophical dissertation on the war process or a lecture T & A (in the early 1960s standards, anyway) travel understanding of Eve Meyer's magnificent body - and a general air of foaming and incompetence. Worth to see to see Eve Meyer stiffens her stuff, but that's pretty much it.
