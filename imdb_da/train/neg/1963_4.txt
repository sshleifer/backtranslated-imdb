This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both and not as good as either. It is also slow and quite predictable. It also has shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get a new age flavor thrown into the mix and some of these scenes come out as a motivational / inspirational sermon. This movie is really a hodgepodge of almost everything. Even though it is gory, the makeup effects are not very realistic. in reality they look a little cheap. From there, there are some really terrible clich√© dialogues. And I don't want to say when, but there is a point where some of the character's actions were not authentic or credible, taking into account the circumstances. No one in their real mind what would have acted this way. When you see the movie, you will know what I mean. There is also some gratuitous nudity for nudity. It was just not necessary at all. The good news is that Acting was actually pretty good. better than this movie deserves s.so, after carefully weighing the proof, id say this movie was acceptable but not good.my judgment for the tooth fairy: 4/10
