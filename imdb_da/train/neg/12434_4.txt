In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and exciting comedy ?? the best he has ever done. Ten years on, he is reduced to reusing the plot of 'Home Alone' in this second sequel, which is not associated with the other films, but is just as uninspired and sadistic. The four villains ?? That's right four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, to introduce this revolutionary change in the series! ?? Electrolysed with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new child is even less charming than Culkin. You'd think the departure from almost all the key players from the first two movies would stop Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that he didn't even come up with 'Home Alone 4'.
