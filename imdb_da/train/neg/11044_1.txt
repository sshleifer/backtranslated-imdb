Staying in Australia as "Hydrosphere", this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you get hypnotized and have to see it to the end to see if it can get worse ... and it does! The story is so predictable that it seems written by a high school drama class, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the thumbnails, and the actor is wood. The child "muppet" seems to have been stolen from the props cabinet of 'Total Recall'. It didn't seem to be a single, original idea throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be so bad that I laughed most of the way. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell was going to hang his head in shame. Of course he needed the money!
