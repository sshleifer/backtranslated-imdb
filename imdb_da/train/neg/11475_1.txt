A movie that makes you throw yourself on a sword. I've seen schlock in my time, but after seeing the miserable mess, I don't think I can ever see another movie again. May God pity the souls who have done this. <br /> <br /> Premise-Ex-Army silent stud, underwear model type character (well acted actually) looks for the girl who sent him an Xmas card while serving in the military. Villages with her cabin, living on the granola type, which are right wingers. The family goes to him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chicken to see that he is a better catch than her liberal appearance, French wine drinker, porsche driving, high cell phone talking, lazy, laughter, Jewish-looking fianc√©. <Br /> <br /> The bad 1d characters, 1d themes. To be beaten over with the Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> The good commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason. It ended.
