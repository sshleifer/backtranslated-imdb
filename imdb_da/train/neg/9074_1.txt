Another bet in the wealth of teen-gross-out comedy put on a college campus with a nerd's search for cooling and how he decides to extort a trio of popular jocks to get him to get the girl. It has all been done before, and it has all been done in a far more satisfactory way. The widespread humor that has made teenage flicks such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's my Car" so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment, so quite coincidentally, the viewer can only tear and reject. The film is poorly written, and the actors never succeed in doing anything of it even a little tolerable. I will not even dignify this horrible picture by enlightening, as it is a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers never have to entertain or induce laughter, and in the worst case, it's terribly bad and sometimes completely unapproachable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his debut Rushmore, humiliated himself by appearing in this picture and wondering how a career can end up in the toilet so quickly. Please avoid, please. Save your money.
