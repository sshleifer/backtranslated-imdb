Dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise: A young mafia killer (Chandler) has to show his boss that he is a good man for the service, so he goes to California to take some lessons with a well-known professional killer Beluschi). First and foremost task: killing a young woman (Lee) who is quite strange to them all. But is she an easy target? The film goes further and further out from this main page, but the result is just bad routine; Even the weird twist in the end doesn't save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give this a 4 (four).
