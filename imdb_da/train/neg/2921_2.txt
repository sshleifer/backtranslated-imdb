The story relates to a genealogist (Mel Harris) who is employed by his Estee Lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt. Her aunt (by marriage we are back to assuming) is trying to track his long-standing family in Europe. All they have to carry on is a picture of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. The researcher leads to Europe and performs his search in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The landscape is the right thing and is actually shot on the spot (unlike a murder, she wrote where Jessica would visit a long rolling landscape and Lansbury never left Burbank). In any case, she meets a young man who also seeks to solve a family music of his own, and they go together to track tracks and threatened evil. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I saw this because of the landscape, but the script was so bad that I just kept on seeing if it would get worse. It did. Action was also off. I can see why Mel Harris's career never really went after thirtysomething, but she's adequate (seems too old for her co-star herself). But the supporting players are right out of the community playhouse. I also lost count of how many times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know it all right? Halfway through the film I realized that this had to be one of the Harlequin movies and that was probably enough. Guess who says it all.
