I could never stand at Happy Days after Chachi was in the cast, so I knew I was in trouble as the best scene in this movie included Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in his first "adult" role turns to his usual professional performance, but this is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I will never come back! No remarkable characters, incredible history, questionable editing and horrible filmography, but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teenagers in the 1970s, where kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this nasty excuse for a movie.
