The Christmas secret was spied on as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the movie when it was over, which makes me believe that the producers were really proud of this project. As an actress myself, I felt that most of the performances were called in, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I wouldn't put this movie on my otherwise fine resume. It was an embarrassment. I had been a fan since his Walton's days, but found myself rude to see any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offer. In defense of the actors, the steering was stolen, mechanically, and thoroughly amateurish. I hope this is not considered as a clever review and negative assumption about my qualifications as a critic. I hit the movie because it had a good cast and I was willing to enjoy the movie. But I want to challenge someone out there to watch this movie and not want their money back, even though it was on T.V.
