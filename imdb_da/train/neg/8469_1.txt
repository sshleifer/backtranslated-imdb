"Children like these" could have been a decent movie, given the subject. But instead it has become a below-average television movie during the week, with not much to go for it. The plot is outdated, plotted predictably, and the direction non-existent. For a better movie on the same subject, try the excellent "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a movie that really cares about the people with Down's syndrome. In "Children like these" they are only used as an excuse for laughing sentimentality. Quite appalling. 1.10
