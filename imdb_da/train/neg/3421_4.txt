STAR RATING: ***** The works **** just miss the mark *** The little bit in between ** Lagging behind the * Gruber <br /> <br /> Some plutonium has disappeared and some very ugly people now have the funds to develop a bomb that can destroy wholesale - so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his boxing young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, another actor from the previous movie) with the help of Josh's adopted daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) set out to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another movie that dealt with terrorism one year after the events of 9/11. Filmed in 2001, Norris even commented on how the plot line for the movie looked like what happened in New York that day, so there would have been those who would have been in the mood for a movie where Norris and his side kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else. Aside from that, it is as changeable as Norris's ever been in. It doubts what the original did to justify a successor in the first place, and if this could be done, a presidential man 3 could come out sometime soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a Norris movie, you've really seen them all, and there's really nothing new or unexpected about this one, but at least you know what you're getting and just as I said it might have been what some needed to turn off some steam. **
