Hi there, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, though I use it as a reference for some time. I will therefore greet you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my judgment, I do not hope for your irritation. I spent 2 years of my life (everything we Greeks actually did), analysis of Omirus epics (and not Homers as you see everywhere), rhymes with rhyme. If I remember well it was Iliada (Iliad) in 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a big disappointment to me and my Greeks around campus (I'm studying in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad Epic is one of the best literature works ever made. It was composed of a Greek poet Omirus all 400 years after the current war. Historians put trojan war around 1200 BC, and the real cause of the war was not Helen's beauty but Troy's strategically crucial position. Having said that, one can now understand that Omirus epic does not present the current events (as it is not properly historical), but it was never the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this great poem, one might wonder about the very definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, holiness, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The best part and the most educational were also these long-standing talks between the warriors before the battle. However, none of these were revealed in Troy. <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really inexpensive for my eyes, and for other intellectuals, including English Finnish and German colleagues. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. That way the perfect storm was a bad and stupid flox (computer graphics did the whole job), and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> I conclude saying you'd rather see something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a really expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
