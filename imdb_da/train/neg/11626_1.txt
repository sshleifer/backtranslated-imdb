This may be the worst show I've ever seen. Apart from the tasteless having sitcom over Hitler, it's just not fun or entertaining in any way. It looks a lot like a 1950s sitcom in its cornball humor and constructed situations, but while it may be well done as I love Lucy, it's just not fun here. I think the show was based on the news "look, it's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure", but it just fell flat in every respect. The guy who plays Hitler is so hammy that it's hard to sit through alone. I wonder what could have made the network believe it was a good idea to fly. I thought America had a tasteless show, but the British had hit us this time. America would never fly a sitcom over Hitler, even though we had the show of Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. Chances are you will probably never see this show as it only broadcast one episode and probably will never be released on DVD.
