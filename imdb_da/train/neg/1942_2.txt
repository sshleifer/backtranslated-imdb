If you don't mind having your feelings played, then you don't mind this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy British mystery mysteries, you follow the tracks and see how they all logically fit into the end, you become very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to the disappointment: <br /> * While the police are using CCTV cameras early to collect traces of the mystery, the huge truck becomes who stopped and blocked the children's vision just before her disappearance was not caught on camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It is inconsistent to get the car, the kids caught on camera, and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The movie is in great length to show the equipment's range of tracking down the children's movements, but miss the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment, tracking vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera -visible places next to the crime scene as part of track development. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is to the left. The director goes out of his way to get the car in the crime park to the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, as it could easily be parked immediately behind or even on the side; as the big truck did. <br /> <br /> * The police forensic team is so careful to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the crime scene, but cannot find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after disappearance and without intermediate rainfall. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; This from the country that is known for developing the dog's dog for search and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not trigger the supposed innocent truck driver who stopped at the flower shop. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and use so much effort to leave the carpet fiber clue under her fingernails to her possible murderers even coaxing her daughter to do the same - while she simply could not have crawled out of the unprotected mobile home. If she had enough meaning to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could just as easily ask her daughter to call for help or even leave the mobile home in a crowded residential park. <Br /> The suspect who abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow / dimwitted - justifying his subconscious drowning of the mother ?? but he was clever enough not to cooperate with the police and also to exercise his rights fully in order not to be self-criminally. <br /> <br /> There are several inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true slug aficionado's disappointment. "Five Days" is a very weak British crime story.
