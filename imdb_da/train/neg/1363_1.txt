This movie starts slowly and then turns off. After looking for about an hour and I absolutely didn't see anything, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no history. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people we all know. The producers of this movie could be sued in a court if they were trying to sell it as a "motion" picture. There is no movement. I could have told the same "story" with a few still pictures with captions. Scripture is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not wasting 60 minutes in my life and looking at "Love in Time for Money", but I missed a good opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to go out, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I saw about 20 people next to me.
