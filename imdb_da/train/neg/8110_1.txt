I think Phillip Kaufman reads the clip's Notes version of the Kundera short story and then talks about making this movie. Okay, of course it won't have the original. Customers' novels are good because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs. This movie doesn't even try! The one dream sequence of Tereza is so important to the atmosphere of the book, reworked and makes no sense at all. Also, and this is perhaps a minor point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks much like Ben Stiller in this (I don't really know a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of Hollywood Izing of otherwise fine literature.
