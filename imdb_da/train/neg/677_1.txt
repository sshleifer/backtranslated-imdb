I shudder to think about what people should have thought of environmentalists after seeing this piece of indulgent preaching scrap. Larded with enough Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to store a new-age shop, Starlight does anyone who gives an enemy that the planet resembles a quarterly crystal-enchanting idiot. <br /> <br /> The reason? Alien Rae Dawn Chong is going to guide a flute that plays the underwear model in a mysterious quest to ward off Earth's imminent environmental collapse. But first, they must defeat an evil alien who does not look as much as a refugee from a Castro bar. Fortunately, the mysterious grandfather Willie Nelson has come together to help (who sees the embarrassment of the matter, as well as he should be) along with cheap F / X pants and reams of meaningless raising music. <br /> <br /> The clear script helps hide the movie's trite plot and dizzying pace, but it's just the tip of this melting film iceberg. Anyone interested in this movie must have their subject card revoked until they complete a course in environmental science.
