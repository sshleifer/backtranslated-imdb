This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The action was poor. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. The majority of the world's population decided to see this comet. Then, the next morning all but a select number of people have been turned to dust from the comets' radiation. The people's clothing is still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but the people turned to dust. No bones, nothing. It's ridiculous. How can radiation burn people, but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Better still, the comet mutated some people into zombie meat that ate monsters. Their makeup would not have looked scary for a newborn baby. The Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and they must look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet went were spared from zombie judgment and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that apparently burns people in their tracks? <br /> <br /> Also abusive is the 60's horror music that plays in the background through parts of the movie or 80's hair coat that doesn't serve any purpose in the movie and causes you to shoot your television. <br /> <br /> However, the stupidest part of the movie is the characters it focuses on: Two Valley Girls and Chakotay by Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely unrealistic. Who would plunder the day after an apocalypse with meat-eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes throughout the movie, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes is unsophisticated dialogue that makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don't watch this movie ever.
