Oh my, I think it may be the only cheesiest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the ultimate b movies. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, it's too common for this. I got this on VHS, from a box full of ex-rental videos on my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I can quote blurb: "In the 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for ages. His name was Mayeda, he was sent on an epic journey worldwide to acquire 5,000 nutmegs. from the King of Spain, while at sea, a violent storm swallows their precious gold, which is meant to buy weapons and almost takes life. Mayeda must fight all odds to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. " saying "A multi million dollar action adventure epicly seen across three continents" <br /> <br /> I must have seen another movie. This was no epic, and it certainly wasn't a million dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the crazy adventure of the English-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). He's not even a Shogun really, but that's not important. What is important is that he makes a really good impression of John Cleese's repeated charging of one slot in 'Monty Python and Holy Grail' and his ability to move from serious scenes to showing his samurai mind-powers. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about this movie is the Sho Kosugi Engrish accent. The movie may lack almost anything that makes a good movie, but makes it something with the cheesy lines ever provided by the coolest Engrish accent ever. And honestly, do you really want something else? You could speed up 'Shogun Mayeda' to the end and play Kosugi's last line over and over again. The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of one line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very very cheesy.
