I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. When it was bombed at the ticket office, it was repeated at night for approx. one month on HBO. And I saw it over and over because television is generally so bad - or was at that time. I no longer look so it can now be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says about pigs: "It may taste like sweet potato cake, but I never know because I wouldn't eat the filthy mare." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out just after Bryan's life so you can guess where the inspiration came from. The few mildly funny bits go too long until you just close your eyes and laugh your teeth. There is a scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both dragged and desiccated, die of thirst. Then they meet as old acquaintances who didn't really know each other, promised to make lunch. It could have been fun. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most clearly is a meeting with Pharaoh, where Pharaoh is a black street kid completed in full King Tut regalia. He must have read the lines just because, at some point before the release, they oversubscribed their scene with the Hollywood answer to black street lingo, spoken by a Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno wannabe). Or it could have been Jimmy Walker - who knows? So what. They managed to transform a significant boring scene into a very racist, very unfunny, very long piece of excrement, one of the legendary things that just won't flush, no matter how many times you try to leave it there for someone else. to handle. <br /> <br /> Now that's my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY IT, whatever you do!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of Corona. Now that they have restored Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably high on the remakes list. Maybe they will hire a comedy writer this time.
