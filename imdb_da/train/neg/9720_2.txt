This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> It's trying to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I have ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I have hardly ever found him very convincing), his father in the movie plays very badly, the story is stupid, the end is .. I think That I do not like a movie so much since "le pacte des loups" (brotherhood of the wolf) from Christophe Gans (and I see / see about 80-100 films a year), but at least the film had some action and lots of good actors. <br /> <br /> I had never commented here (only evaluated) and when I saw the review and the comments I thought I had to write something down. <br /> <br /> I don't think we are having trouble selling the DVD we were offered: not such a bad movie in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open minded (I see SF, western, drama, comedies, silents, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this movie was so boring that I felt I had lost hour and a half.
