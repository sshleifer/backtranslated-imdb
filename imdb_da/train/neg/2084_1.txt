if they gave me the possibility of negative numbers, I would use it. This movie was really god-horrible. I went into the theaters, expecting it was terrible, and somehow managed to exceed my expectations. The scripture was weak, the play was painful. I wanted to go out, but my friend drove and wanted to get her money's worth, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast growth when the girls got their super power and change of hair Color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for that part of the super villain he came out as strangely weak and silly. Jenny Johnson's (Uma Thurman) came out as psychotic and strange, like Matts (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
