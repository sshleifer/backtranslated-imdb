It seems to me as a recent film school exam that in these times of New Zealand movies reaching new heights, the public seems to think that every New Zealand movie is made is great. Sion's Wedding shows that this is badly wrong. It's totally overstated and not fun, and far from the 'hilarious' movie, other users of IMDb have commented. The only really fun thing I found in this movie was Derek, the wannabe black guy, but except that the jokes were reused shit as we all had heard before. Being semi-Samoan decent, I wanted to see how the film was to deal with Polynesian representation. It was a complete ball-up - I know it's a presumably comedy, but I didn't feel the characters had anything new to say about Polynesian identity, even though it was in a heavy-in-kind way. I was most disappointed with the end of the movie and the dissolution of the character's relationship - Mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women, coming to a little turning his way when the "Dusky Maiden" comes to town, has a epiphany, perhaps he should start looking for a stable relationship, so at the last moment reject it and accept his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women. I didn't understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh, but ended up being really bitter about paying to watch it at the cinema. The bests are at best, it is especially about Sephas boyfriend, APPALLING, and honestly, I would have been happy if I had the hands of one of those pirate copies of the movie to save myself the $ 15 fare. /> <br /> I think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it is the second step (behind No. 2, of course, a much better movie for this) in the Polynesian cinema. I hope Pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from Sion's Wedding how to NOT reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say. Although it does happen in a comedic way.
