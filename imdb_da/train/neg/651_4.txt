I watched this movie a few days ago and jumped old under the scary parts. I must admit, I found it pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters were saying. Logical Problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a beautiful fit, makes no sound while being killed. Don't you think he might have at least tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the comment is made that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa," I almost screamed on the screen. Once your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher in love with her, you can't comment on that if you have half the heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle gossip over there can be danger ahead, it would not be wise to do Donna, girlfriend, aunt and uncle in a car and drive far, far away, so bait the house with HRT and police force, so the killer does not have the opportunity to get out? <br /> <br /> I could continue. And on. And on. The reason was that the plot was decent, the signs were not profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered, and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> BUT. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie can be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night. If you don't consider all the goofs, it's a mediocre movie.
