A veterinarian in Vietnam decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in is eliminated (including women). Published for theaters just before "A Star is Born", which showed his career, this is the action-drama mishmash with Kris Kristofferson, who is wildly, thoughtlessly and mediocre. Filtered in Simi Valley, California, the results are truly indecent, with redneck clich√©s and mindless violence making up most of the director George Armage's script. Armitage has gathered a most curious' 70s cast for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and Little Loni Anderson; But the center of it all is Kristofferson, who is gruff and rude all the way through. It deserves points I suppose to be a completely unsympathetic recording in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like a nasty spot. * 1/2 from ****
