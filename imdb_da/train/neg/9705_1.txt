I watched the movie as a child when it was released in the theater, and it was so bad it became a family joke. If the ranking had a zero, this movie would get it. The dinosaurs were horrible. The story was ridiculous. The action does not qualify to be called acting. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family is still talking about how bad it really was.
