With a tendency to repeat, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'Paris Texas'. <br /> <br /> 'Land of plenty' is no exception. Considering that I was expecting an average mediocre movie, even before I entered, Wender's ambitions always seem to be better off him. It's taken for the reef now, his film is heavy-handed and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure if I was watching a comedy mocking Central America or some thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Wender insists on putting many many scenes with some rock song is also very annoying. He covered the gaps in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes. I am sure many people will find this movie important and resonant, but frankly, this clumsy and didactic effort speaks only poorly. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Wenders announced that while making "Paris Texas," he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, it was Wender's best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter. His film from the last 15 years + was a total mess.
