Although it did get some favorable press after playing at Toronto Intl. The Film Festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this. One - it's an ultra-low budget Canadian movie. Two - it is written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign unless it is Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But despite looking at it with lower expectations, it still turned out to be a far greater disappointment than I thought was possible. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - bad script, bad acting, terrible management! Don't waste your time or money on this turkey. It claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. Plus, there is horrible music blaring all the way through. How this got some attention, I never know.
