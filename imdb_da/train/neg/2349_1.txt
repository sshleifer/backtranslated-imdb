There was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally incapable of conveying the great charisma that Biko had. Attenborough's big crowd scenes are ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like this, three nice lines of children (some do wagon wheels!) Marching happily into the soldiers' weapons. With Biko dead, the film quickly comes down to the farce. If the fight against Apartheid was something, it was a black people's struggle, but somehow we all had to grab a white man and his family escape. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he wasn't. Penelope Wilton accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all. at all. The tree's family dog ​​gets more lines than the black girl. As the family makes their escape, the women I watched the movie - by the way, one of only a dozen black people in a big, full movie - whispered, "It's like the sound of music." She had a point. All in all, it is a movie with a well-meaning, if somewhat eerie white liberal about a radical black people's struggle. And really, South Africa needs well-meaning white liberals as if it needs a hole in the head.
