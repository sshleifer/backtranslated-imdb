I love a good war movie and I fall into the category "been there, done it". So I would like to think that my review is an accurate (IMHO). After just watching this movie on DVD, I can safely say that it was a pile of waste. I can't recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br /> It started shouting on the TV and saying "you wouldn't do it" etc ... but I soon realized that having a bit of work experience would be an obstacle so I chilled a little. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell, I got an unpleasant feeling that this movie would be a predictable dud ... I was right. There was simply no logic on the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient rebels ever on the other end of the command line or remote control. So much so, I was left scraping my head all the time. So when you think you know where the story goes, the boys in Humvee are out on their own around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in theater on a jolly bumping to some SAS wannabe contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just so ridiculous. It just made no sense and made me turn it on and off. So for them to pull it so long, really tried my patience. It started with "Contact Right" and went down the hill quickly. If you had a Brit accent, then you were shot, but if you were part of the EOD team, you were suddenly a good shot and saved the day. So as soon as you thought it was over it stretched for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. You are about to see and ask why has it not ended yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had the blown scene where they just hit each other for a laugh. Another scene where you just wanted it to end. It didn't add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> As my life seemed very boring, the star star went out of the lead to chase someone down. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. It believed all logic and ability to write a good story ... it was pointless and terrible. I still don't understand why they wasted time on it. So to see him just jog through the busy streets that go back to the camp, I had rolled on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story is all over the show without really deciding what it will be. I thought it would be stupidly illogical EOD scenes, but then it continued to go on keys trying to be something different. But as hard as it tried, it just bored me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed in a series of stupid, pointless, action scenes. There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience compromised the pleasure, but even the naive must realize that this just doesn't make sense. The only thing that is more stupid than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be 24/7 working in the box office office team that seems to use this site as a way to get everyone to believe it is well. Excuse people ... it's just not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it will just drill you.
