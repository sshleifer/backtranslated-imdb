This movie is supposed to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. But 30 minutes in the movie it becomes a fun, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly kicks the blonde girl or when he "carries" the butcher's old lady. The lines, characters and plays are all badly done from get-go. I've always wanted Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some horrible movies this year; This is by far the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an intense historically gripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, rent the original. But if you intend to see it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and join scenes instead of taking them seriously; It's the only way you enjoy this movie.
