In my life I have seen many great and terrible movies. I am not an expert in professional reviews but I certainly have something to say about this. First of all, these actors are the worst I have seen ... Your acting is so unreal that you will discard the DVD for the first 2 minutes. I think these players were not interested in the quality. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing is about these dialogues - they're so lame. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14-year-old son could work better. I feel this movie had a budget similar to the price of my 14 year old European car ... <br /> <br /> If my message reaches you - save time and money.
