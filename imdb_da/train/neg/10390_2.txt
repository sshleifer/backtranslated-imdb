I rented and watched this movie just to see what's so much. So here's what my reactions to it are. It is easy to see that this is a low budget film with poor players. The main file of this film is about a woman getting revenge on her rapes. This concept, if done right, could easily turn out to be a really provocative movie. However, the film does not shock me or disturb me at all. It just bored me. This movie can easily be shortened to under 45 minutes. All of the many scenes are there mainly to fill in time as the scene scenes and some scenes I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find rape scenes pretty pretty. I do not know if I have seen the cropped or unknown version, if in fact such a version. I also found many plot holes in the already poorly written plot. Here is a list at the top of my heart. Why the rapists don't rape Jennifer at night when she went out to the house to find out what those noise is. It would be an excellent time. Why don't they just rape her rape instead of delaying some of the rape pleasure and extending Jennifer's trial for so long. That would probably be more shocking and disruptive in that way. I found it really stupid that the rapes left her in the woods and came back to her house. Maybe to show that these rapes are really imbeciles. These rapes should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job properly, they should not send a coward imbecile to do the job. /> Why did Jennifer not call the police when the rapes finally left? Which should be the first thing that appears in most people's minds, especially for someone who is a writer. Why didn't these rapes endanger miles away when they saw Jennifer alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really amazing that a slim lady like Camille can pull a man up and hang him. ************************ Ends spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> Hey, this movie is not without its benefits, Camille Keaton is beautiful and I hear one of the funniest lines I have recently heard when Matthew protests to go back to the house and kills Jennifer, "Why me? Why I, I was not even !!!
