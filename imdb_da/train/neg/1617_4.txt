What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions are made for "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or enhanced sound. Facial expressions are usually covered with thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonous lilt that sounds the same, either in the middle of a stroke or I was talking about a bonfire. <br /> <br /> I've seen these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go and be entertained by. It's quite long and boring on the spot. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that, given the lack of any plot development, I don't think it's very educational. It is also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read a little about the story so that you can understand the connection with what happens when the instructor did not for some reason find it appropriate to inform the audience why Che's band was about to move in the way they did - as a result, there seem to be groups that fall outside the forest for no particular reason and are shot at. I would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow creating more empathy with me and developing in depth, but somehow all the characters were still alien to me at the end. The stars get it for realism and show the difficulties associated with guerrilla warfare.
