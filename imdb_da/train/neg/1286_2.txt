How does a Scottish in a kilt love in bonny purple heather? Very very careful. Now I have the distinct advantage over many other reviewers because I was born in Scotland. For many Americans, this simplified nonsense takes seriously. It's a joke, people "four legs good - two legs bad," as Orwell did. Jessica Lange has an accent that Wells - Next - the - Sea Amateur Dramatic Society production of "Brigadoon" would fall down. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - carries his kilt with all the authority of a man whose grandmother once left the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And Auld Enemy? Where would the Scots be without them hating and blaming everything? People Roth, Cox and Hurt were ashamed to indulge in such racist stereotyping. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems like a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was fun.
