An art house belly dream. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; A pretentious melange, which not only deserved the best picture of 1951 on its own merits, became the dwarf of the competition from the start. Place in the Sun, Detective History, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; You name it if it came out in '51, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The final ballet is a clap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few players in their time were less able to act or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 worst of '51 (I saw 201 movies), and among the top 5 best Oscar winners.
