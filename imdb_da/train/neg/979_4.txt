Anyone who has a distant interest in science fiction should start with the basics. All say STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies to begin with, which is fine, but the truth is the TERMINATOR, and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is much better choice than the series. SOYLENT is probably science fiction's best kept secret. It remains one of the greatest, but most forgotten movies, but the impact of its setting becomes more and more reality every day. Charlton Heston overrates his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson in his final role gets the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes touch. <br /> <br /> It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is crowded and food is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A great leader of the Soylent company is murdered, and police detective Thorn is on the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of soy green is not a mystery if you examine the movie. SOYLENT is fun to watch, but the entire manuscript is a joke. It's as cheap as the whole production. The play and the drama of the actors made the film, but was completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron, and no one knows the rules, especially cop thorn, who likes to just roll into people's apartments, browse shamelessly and steal everything he wants. The character's interactions keep your attention on the movie, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. A fun piece if you have time, but don't expect anything more.
