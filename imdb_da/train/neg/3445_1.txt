When the young Kevin gets the boat from his dead uncle as a gift, he invites five friends to him for a trip to Catalina Island over the weekend. During the journey they drink spirits, have sex and play games, each of which tells his or her greatest fear. Later, Kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest inner fear. Yesterday my wife, son, daughter and three other friends went together to see "haunted boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of play time, the group stopped seeing this messy and boring amateur piece of crap, and we decided to watch another movie. Later I decided to see the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better to go to bed to sleep. The confused story has a horrible movie and camera work with a casting that is probably studying to be actors and actresses, and finally this movie seems to be a bad project of cinema school. The horrible and pretentious manuscript shows a ridiculous twist in the end, actually a complete mess that did not make me realize what the story is about. Was the girl crazy and traveled alone in the boat and imagined the whole situation with imaginary friends? If that is true, is their friend ultimately fruit of her madness? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Trip to the Death")
