It's like what the title of this thread says. The only impression I got from that movie is that Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. Her character's first date with William Hurts character, where they danced, was stupid. All in all, I have tried to finish watching the movie four times, and four times I fell asleep. I would continue to watch that movie with an intention ... to strike my problem of insomnia because all it does is put me to bed. Sweet Dreams.
