The third part of the "Carnosaur" trilogy has a lot of Keystone Kops quality military commands that try to kill two velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give it a 4 out of pure sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really cannot be taken seriously. More significantly, however, I see this movie, I can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "Carnosaur" and the "Xtro" trilogies. The first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing movie that has become a cult classic, the other is an "Alien" ripoff, and the third is a heavy-in-cheek, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) movie that you have rolls on the floor laughing. Also, like the "Xtro" franchise, all the "Carnosaur" films are completely independent of each other. They only carry the franchise name to drum the interest in "successors," I think. Of course, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three movies with both franchises, you'll find yourself referring back and forth between the two.
