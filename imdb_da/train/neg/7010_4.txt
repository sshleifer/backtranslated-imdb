I know nobody cares, but I do. This movie is historical for a reason. It's the unit of two heroes from two big seventies sci-fi movies. Well, one is big and one is pretty bad. The big one is really big, in fact it is best. The bad is really bad, in fact it is the worst. Of course, I refer to "Star Wars", and it's star Mark Hamill, also "Luke Skywalker" who is totally in this movie about a child who gets her Vette swiped and then goes to Vegas (on the forefront) and after a whole lots of adventures, eventually it recovers. (Since he is fixing cars, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way, he meets a hooker with a heart of gold and ends up turning off with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the 70s sci-fi cult movie "Laserblast", which I have suggested earlier, the worst sci-fi film ever made. Milford plays the leading baddie that Hamill will steal his car back from. I realize no one cares about this meeting with two great sci-fi heroes, but I do. And I must also say that this is one of the best / worst movies all the time. Mark Hamill's play needs the power, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts can just be the most annoying of all time, ever in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or an everyday night, late at night, very late. It is one of the films that winds, looks for something but without finding it, and yet it is all purpose, such as free form jazz, to exist as it is. And it does. And it's not that good, but you can't say it's not entertaining, because in an hour and a half you can feel ripped, but you won't feel cheated. So, swallow your mind, relax and enjoy this confused gem with no expectation, and power is always with you.
