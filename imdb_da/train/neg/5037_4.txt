Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she is fifteen years old and her birthday comes up in a week. When Melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to hang out with her, but the few who are able to catch her interest mysteriously die. To be honest, the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is because Dana Kimmel from Friday 13th to 3th was in it, which is not a good reason to hurry up and watch a movie. When I began to see it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slasher, it is really boring and boring and just doesn't go anywhere. After over an hour there are only three murders, and the story is not really developed in any way. <br /> <br /> The movie is nicely shot with pretty great photography and good management, but like with many other 80's slasher flicks, the movie suffers from being too dark at times. The play is actually quite good, though and Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even though she is a complete slam. The story is not bad, but it is just too boring to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested were Melissa, she was great and Dana Kimmel was really sweet and sweet in this movie. All in all, pretty boring slasher flick that doesn't go anywhere, I would definitely not recommend it to Slasher fans.
