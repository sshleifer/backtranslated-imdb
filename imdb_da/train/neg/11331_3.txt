With all due respect for the respect of this George Stevens Sr. "epic" of errors and misunderstandings, I can only wonder that James Dean "legend" could survive this outing, I submit that the study time of bankable box office "giants" came a cropper of his own "gigantic mites". Likewise, Rock and Liz were not so much better. Let's just say that the TV "Dallas" was the authentic "heir," even though the later day "Texans" like Lay and Delay, not to mention our supposed "president" of these here yewbenighted states of Amurrika, perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions. I have never read Edna Ferber's original but will put the odds, it's head and shoulders better than what came on the screen here. And all the well-paid, I can imagine that "supporting" actors of note and celebrity, regardless of, "Giant" is at least my midget of little profit, never against the promotional campaigns.
