After reading the book, which was of great importance to me, the film did not give me the feeling that the book conveyed. It makes me wonder if Kaufman himself liked this book, because he has successfully done something else. Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the brightness?! From the very first scene, music extracts most of the dialogue and feeling, and it continues right through the film. I think the decision makers thought that having optimistic music playing right through the movie would make history feel light - but they've completely failed here. Instead, the music controls everything that is "movie experience", somehow dramatic events, so we sleep on them, so everything actually feels heavy. Another example of how this adaptation fails is by decorating the story line making it more dramatic. In the film we see Franz, who passes Tomas on the street, who is about to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting / passage, which I probably did not find in the book, gives Tomas's history more importance than it does light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has changed, imo to the worst, but it may have happened because the book simply does not convert well to a movie, so is Customer's style. This makes us doubt that all the generous reviewers on this site wrote with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the movie. A movie that is as long as it is uncomplicated. For those who haven't read the book, I just recommend reading it. For those who have, I have to say that you just want to waste your time and probably end up writing similar permanent warnings.
