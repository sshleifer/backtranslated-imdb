Despite a decent first season, this series never came close to realizing its potential. Seen as a prequel to the original "Star Trek" series, it was almost from the start of an executive producer, Rick Berman, convicted, who felt compelled to artificially limit and limit the definition of what a "Star Trek" series could be (which made this futuristic show become increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, did not help with his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and the careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious early that he was only in it for the payline). Never seen a series "so consistently bad service for a cast of talented actors (Jolene Blaylock excluded) for so long. It's as if the whole series was produced in a bubble that existed outside the modern television landscape where the audience (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic desires and desires. Unfortunately, it seems as if Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at Paramount that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue "and that its core audience did not go away but was driven away. Produce a quality sacrifice that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) come. <br /> <br /> Simple said in a TeeVee universe where we are shown, "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield" show the powers to give the public a "Star Trek" that measures and is dramatically competitive, which is as easy and easy.
