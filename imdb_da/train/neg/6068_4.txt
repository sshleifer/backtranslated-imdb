Vodka Lemon is a charming yet extremely uneven Arminian movie that will delight some and drill others. Though reasonably well designed, the film lacks any real "zing", which is based on many scenes that will be common to the magnificent artist. The film contains a handful of moments of pure cinematic shine, unfortunately they deserve a movie worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to brighten up as a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately dissatisfied. You can laugh, but these moments will be few and far between in the middle of a sea of ​​leached snow-filled landscapes and a seemingly endless number of bus routes. A noble effort that ultimately takes place in the absence of narrative cohesion.
