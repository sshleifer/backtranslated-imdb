Steam tale of the American Revolution. When the farmer 'Tom Dobb' (Al Pacino) and his son arrive in New York Harbor, they are immediately enrolled by gadekyllin Annie Lennox ... Annie Lennox? .. to contribute to the war effort. After being chopped down by chains knocked out of British guns, Tom and his son are immediately tamed by the continental army sympathizing with "Daisy" (Nastasia Kinski) to "not stand their ground". After this Kodak moment, a series of digressive chapters take place, including Tom's participation in a "foxhunt", where he will carry a model of "poor old Georgie Washington" filled in the picture as he runs from a lace handkerchief-engaging English captain (Manning Redwood) and have a barbeque with a group of Iroquois Indians as they plan the best way to sneak back into battle, so Al and his intruder can kick the crap out of the British officer Donald Sutherland's ass. <br /> <br /> Director Hugh Hudson presents a unique style of filmmaking, and the atmosphere is as thick as the spellbinding London fog, but the manuscript's painting of red jackets as evil monsters reveals once again Hollywood's patented hatred of the British. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as an enlisted American soldier.
