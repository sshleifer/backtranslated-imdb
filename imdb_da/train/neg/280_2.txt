God, I was bored out of my head when I saw this pilot. I was expecting a lot from that as I am a big fan of James Cameron (and not just the "Titanic" I could add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (So again, he also wrote leaden Strange Days ..). But it was no wonder getting my attention at some point in almost two hours. At that time, it hardly went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the clutter of threads that went nowhere. Besides that, I do not think that the acrobatics even went out of the ordinary "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, of course she is beautiful, but the fact that she only shows a single facial expression throughout the film (pouty and surly) also makes me bored with her "crazy with an attitude" soon. You can count me out of this, Mr. Cameron!
