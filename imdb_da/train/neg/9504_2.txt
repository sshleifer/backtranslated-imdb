The only reason I saw this movie was because I had recently read Robert Hough's less than perfect but interesting, fictional account of Big Cat coach Mabel Stark's life. Beaty appears as a sign in the book, in a less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I hadn't realized before I checked out the movie later on IMDb that it was originally a serial. Anyone who edited the original run time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minute version available on DVD has done a good job. The abbreviated version plays just as well as any B movie in the period despite the many 'duh-what?' moments. Eg. Are we really expected to believe that our hero dug the twenty-foot deep tiger trap in the morning without getting its iodhpurs dirty? Look over the chapter titles. I see that number five is called "Gorilla Warfare" and number eleven is called "The Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the movie at all. I think that's where some of the cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historicaly interesting.
