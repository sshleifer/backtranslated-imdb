This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I have seen. It just didn't happen at all, really. Briefly, I thought it would be pretty good, but every fight just seemed to fall. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the better games. Benoit carried it. I didn't think the MVP was so big, but Benoit saved the fight. <br /> <br /> Kane vs Khali Wow, these two guys don't mix. Or maybe it is Khali and any other living person does not mix. Terrible fight. <br /> <br /> Melina vs Ashley I'm not a fan of female wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was thrilled with this fight until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. Edge vs CM Punk vs King Booker vs Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy vs Kennedy vs Finlay vs Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB game so far. Just a big let down to many people in the ring at the same time. It just didn't live up. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs Umaga O.K. not extremely impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker This was perhaps the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel this battle deserved to be the last. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I start to get sick to see Cena win every fight though. It gets a little old. Now I have to say that I feel this battle is the best of the night, but I'm a big Shawn Michael's fan so I'm a little biased. Batista vs. Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night, and most others came really short.
