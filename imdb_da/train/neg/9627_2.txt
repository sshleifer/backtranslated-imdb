Okay, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, though I'm lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I don't think this girl can act at least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen her in is very difficult to get past her fake play. It sounds like she's just standing there reading just outside the script. This movie had only one good thing about it, and it was that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is so used and abused, it's ridiculous. How many movies have the same type of plot ?? Can we say "Forces of Nature ??" Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, it is boring. I knew everything was going to happen before it did. It was a bore, but seeing Stiller is always a pleasure !!!
