holy sh * t this was god terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes, and I thought I should greatly increase my eyes in the Oedipus Rex manor. Dear God. This movie does not deserve more credit than anything made by a middle school movie buff. Please save money, this movie can't offer you anything. Unless you enjoy side shows and sleep in cinemas. You know, listen, take your girlfriend and make things interesting. You will be the only ones there anyway. F @ ck this slide show. <br /> <br /> You will be warned. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend seeing this. <br /> <br /> Hi. <br /> <br /> How's it going? /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daily movie. this is sad.
