Now I rented this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He's an excellent actress, BRILLIANT in total ... except this movie. And I think it was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and did not interfere with good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines just break me up. And there are some lines that don't make sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper just throws lines in without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW the plot is BAD! But it's one of the movies that is TAHT BAD that it's actually nice to see. I only recommend this to BIG Brad Dourif fans or fans of any of the other players because the plot is pathetic.
