I actually saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I gave the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard in a theater sooner or later: "No refund!" As soon as I heard these words, I just waved goodbye to my money and went home. But no, stupid, I went in and saw the movie. This movie didn't make anyone in the laugh of the theater. Not even once. Not even unintentionally! For the most part, we sat in anesthetized silence. Every tenth or so someone will shout "This movie SUCKS!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically and then sit in anesthetic, boring silence for another ten minutes.
