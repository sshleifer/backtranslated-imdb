A cowboy sympathetic to a nearby Indian tribe is mistakenly accused of rape and murder of the chief's daughter, leading to much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This crackpot nudie feature is fun to watch, though thoroughly impossible to defend at any artistic level. The dreadful costumes and the fact that all Indians are of course white, make this look like a live action cartoon than the serious production as it is the press material that it does. <br /> In short, the abundance of nudity (the real reason to see this) is good. Everything else is not. There are definitely better examples of both genres. More interestingly, The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and does not have one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who were probably already in the can of murder at the time it hit the soda screens in the Pussycat Theater!
