Most action movies are crass of Hindi cinema, especially Sunny and his family <br /> <br /> The movie is typically Sunny type with bashes, large dialogues and melodrama. <br /> <br /> The movie also has typical Rajiv Rai ingredients of many minions and a strange villain <br /> <br /> The start is okay and then the shift to Kenya is good, but then the film goes on. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events is moving at a slow pace and nothing like big happening <br /> <br /> They are many stupid scenes that Kenya police officers appear as jokers, especially Sharat > <br /> Climaxet is also extended <br /> <Rajiv Rai does a good job Music is okay, only 1 song works and that's the last TOOFAN camera work is good. Sunny Deol is, as usual, Chunky seems like a monkey, while his serious scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is okay heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri is not even half as scary as he was in the TRIDEV rest is okay
