Without repeating what was said above about this movie, I would like to add that I was delighted to see this movie ... cast / location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom, etc. It had a vague shadow of " Don't look now at the beginning of the story. A stay in different surroundings (Italy again) to dampen the loss ... or maybe I saw it? So I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country .... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? Nothing actually happens! and i mean nothing !! You don't even get the chance to get into the characters as they are so one-dimensional and vacuumed. You are led to believe in the pace of the movie that something should happen to turn the whole movie upside down ... The oldest daughters flirted with the local vespa boys, had great opportunity to take the film in another direction, the youngest daughters Visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and meaningless exercise. The fathers are trying to be seduced by one of his female students feeling ridiculous considering his age. It felt as if the manuscript had a last recall where they decided at the last minute to exterminate any gut for history and went to pair it down to a clean minimum to no effect. When the credits started rolling (unexpectedly), you can't help but feel robbed of your time sitting and watching this pile of waste.
