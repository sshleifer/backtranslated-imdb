This movie was entertaining at times, hell it was sometimes fun. <br /> <br /> However, the underlying message I came from the movie was that women are responsible for all the human problems. Every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is lazy, is plain or paralyzed by some poor guy for no apparent reason. I don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men. But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's just a point of view. Although I do not agree, they still have the right to do so. <br /> <br /> A funny movie, but some of the comments others have made are just stupid. Best movie ever my foot.
