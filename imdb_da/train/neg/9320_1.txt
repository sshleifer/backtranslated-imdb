If this movie was a comedy, I'd have given it a 10. Oh my, where do I start? Put it this way - I've seen many horrible horror movies, but this one makes Troll 2 look like freakin 'Save Private Ryan. It's as if a group of pornographic filmmakers decided to make a horror movie, changed in mid-production and decided to make a comedy, then went back to horror and then decided that they should just get stuck with porn (softcore on it). Everything about this movie is simply horrible: the musical score (someone shoots the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the manuscript, the director, the cinematography, the actor. There is simply no word to describe this. Oh wait, yes there are: Holy $ *!
