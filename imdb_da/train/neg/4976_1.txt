I saw Grendel the second night and was forced to put together a Public Service Announcement. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the millennial Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The sci-fi channel has a growing catalog of unofficial and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised an unauthorized low budget mini-epic, but one refused to let me change channels. It was staggering, overwhelming, bad. I saw in fascination and horror at the train wreck that you could not tear your eyes away. I reached a notepad and managed to catch some of what I saw. The following may contain spoilers or maybe just save your sanity. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to get it over with, Beowulf's warriors wore horny helmets. Trivial problem compared to what came after. It also seems that the helmets were in a box and handed over to which actor walked next door. Adaptation, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. - Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed to make the movie by Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already made the rest of her makeup. - Ben Cross didn't pretend to be embarrassed like the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become the Danes king just minutes before the film opened and had not had the chance to have the crown changed to suit him yet. <br /> <br /> - To facilitate players' returns for their day jobs, tables are waiting, no one was obliged to change their hairstyles at all. The variety of hairs included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialogue. To prove that it was a multinational cast, everyone was encouraged to keep whatever accent they chose. <br /> <br /> - As is typical of this type of film (at least since Mad Max), the leather hood was a requirement. In this case, it was oddly shaped, bad and brand new. <br /> <br /> - The female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long tradition of hotties, to be seen with the volume turned down completely. <br /> <br /> - The film's accidental focus was a repetitive, composite armband with exploding bolts. It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when it was fired. It succeeded in destroying the laws of physics, the sincerity of the original play, historical fact and plot tension in itself. <br /> <br /> - Hrothgar's Palace, Heorot, was instead a Nordic long hall, apparently designed and built by craftsmen who sunk with Atlantis. - Beowulf arrived in the Danes' homeland in a two-mast stern-cast ship, which was originally part of a set, the other two were Santa Maria and Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth observed Beowulf's ship approach using a telescope. Before you could recover from the amazing innovation, you had to see the ship from its point of view. Judges from the angle were the prince in a kind of plane. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 1: In Bulgaria, the fire (from a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the actor's breath, both indoors or out. <br /> <br /> - Fun Facts 2: Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dancing I went to in the 8th grade. <br /> - Fun Fact 3: You can also make a catapult with an explosive exploding explosive exploding. But don't expect it to actually hurt anything. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a World War II veteran, "Incoming!" to cancel any remaining default. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so sad and always on average because he couldn't leave footprints as a complete CGI creation. Even in snow. - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and junior had not inherited his wings. Resistant gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now make a trained guess that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and mother chose to accidentally kill, fly away, or withdraw their prey based on a close reading of the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - Fun Medical Fact: Being thrown by a mythical animal that is hard enough to be thrown fifty meters to stone, causes small facial scars that do not bleed much. /> <br /> - The legend's sword, which Beowulf used to send Hag, was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put another tire on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, wobbling struck some concerns over its weight. <br /> <br /> - Best line in the movie: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quarter of blood about six feet. Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said, "You're going to be okay, my prince." So much for that job at the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
