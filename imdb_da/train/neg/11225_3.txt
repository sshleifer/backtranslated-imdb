This documentary is a resumption of the last few years of Betty Page's (Paige Richards) career. The Tennessee boy was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetish, bondage and cat-fight "girly flicks". Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) on his Movie Star News instructed Betty what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous images or "stag movies", but nevertheless Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. It is not surprising that Betty had a cult following at the height of her career. The girl next door with jet black hair, blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would be fascinated for decades. After all, it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and the other only for the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie could actually have been much better; but good enough to keep the interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is amazing in itself. Bra, panties, belt belt and snake must not at least damage its image. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Please note that this movie may change your heart rate.
