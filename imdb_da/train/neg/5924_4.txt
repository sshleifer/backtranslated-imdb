Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice - maybe it was the hair. Regardless of whether this time she is not a goddess (see the previous episode), but is a very famous lady with magical powers that allows her to communicate and see a Medusan without being mad (the normal human response). Unfortunately, the man who is most in love with her is a couple of cards on a full deck and he is trying to kill the Medusan Ambassador (who strangely lives in a small box - it's a miserable way to travel). And unfortunately, Muldayr does not hurt everything as well though. What happens next is a little stupid, and when the episode was in the first place, I saw it, I was pretty relieved. When looking at all the men on board, he crossed Muldaur, was rather stupid, and Spock's appearance when he was briefly crazy was quite campy. Do yourself a favor - if you haven't seen the show before, choose another episode.
