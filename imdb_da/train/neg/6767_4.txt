I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could do it another time. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. Fun at Matt Dillon (think about Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious play by Micheal Keaton. This is not fun. The Love Bug was, but it can be seen. One of my main disturbances from the movie was that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was sorry the headlights eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bend front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, ie. "single digit bracket" kids and don't expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
