My God, what happens? a Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! Really note that most of the positive reviews come from beginners to Boll's work. I myself, as I have mentioned in previous Uwe Boll reviews, only see his films in the hope that someday he will do something good. I mean ... IT MUST HELP A DAY! Alas, Seeds are not that day. I don't quite know where to start with lame attempts on a horror movie that Seed is. Things to remember are that all sickos in the world are that way because of having seen different sick acts on video or the web ..... or so think Mr. Boll. I still can't figure out for life why recordings of real animal cruelty and killing were needed in the first 10 minutes of this movie. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a sicko and enjoys seeing such things ..... but does not understand why Mr Boll thought to put real footage into the movie would work. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm ..... Well, I'm not squeamish and can handle watching something on film. However, I cannot find the use of real animal cruelty at least. If you tried to shock me, it didn't work. It reminded me just how shaken the world was because such things happened and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making movies. This kind of context may have worked for movies in the 70s / 80s (Cannibal Holocaust), but not today's market. <br /> <br /> With it out of the way, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap mood like BloodRayne 2. You can just tell that there was not much money flowing around for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr Boll is not very worried about making a decent story as we are treated to boring police images that look at various videos of Seed's victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends with a faster breakdown of the victim. It is very boring and boring. I will not comment on the toddler scene as it is ridiculous and just another cheap 'shock' factor. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit through the first 25 minutes then you will be treated to police officers going through a very dark house to catch Seed. The lighting here is horrible, and Uwe has the old 'I don't use a steady camera' failure as he did with BloodRayne 2. Look, when police officers die in still stupid ways until a time when Seed is trapped. This scene is so bloody stupid, you have to see it to believe it. The police actually tell Seed he could have shot him. For some unknown reasons, the police do not shoot him. Since Seed is a sicko who kills children as well as adults, you would have thought of this time in the script that sense would prevail. <br /> <br /> From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene, followed by police burying Seed alive (and they know he is alive .. why not shoot him in the head?), followed by Seed come out ground and then kill some random women with a hammer and then kidnap one of the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to get you all here is that it's just STUPID! It's not even Hollywood horror silly .... just stupid. Uwe Boll cannot directly ****. Anyone with any taste ounce would agree with this statement. Anyone who sees this movie and found it entertaining in any form or form must take a serious look at himself as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again we are treated to a badly acted, directed, enlightened, produced, scripted piece of UB crap.
