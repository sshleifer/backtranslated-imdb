"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" has many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from shows like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no resemblance to the original characters, and the stories are boring and badly made. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show just doesn't work. This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure, and it should not be more than a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
