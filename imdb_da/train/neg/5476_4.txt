I don't know if this is one of SyFy Channel's original movies, but that's exactly what it feels like. An inexpensive, low-budget action movie that was probably made very quickly contains the ridiculous effects, lame dialogue and a vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it (fun where many of the 90210 kids are making cheap TV movies now) . <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, as we know from history as a explorer who wiped out entire populations of indigenous people while defeating parts of North America. Here he is not played as a wholly or even sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably be killed if this was not resolved based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a short survey mission, trying to find something of value to prove that he deserves funding to further explore America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs. The actual hero of the story turns out to be Lt. Rios, who turns out to be honest, resourceful and wise. He knows the right thing to do in any situation, which puts him in opposition to Cortes, as well as to the young, ambitious aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who was to marry the head of shameful shamans for Rios falls and promotes her anger towards the Spanish outsiders. So it's all beautiful clich√©. The dinosaurs are sent relatively easily. Although taking place in an area that appears to be open, history takes place in either the forest or the Aztec village for 95% of the time, so it is not visually exciting either. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and a convincing accent, and so he disappeared into it. He doesn't see or hear Spanish in a second, but makes the choice of choice wrong in every way. If this movie had been released in theater, he would have been designated a Razzie, no doubt. <br /> <br /> All in all, forgettable.
