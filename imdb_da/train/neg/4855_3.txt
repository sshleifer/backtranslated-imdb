I really wanted to like this movie but ended up boring and incredible. The first shot is a camera feeding from a robot traveling against a bomb and is, of course, shaken. But then the rest of the movie remains in the shakycam state, even during quiet conversation moments, to the point of ridicule. Do the rental houses no longer stand and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot at 16mm does not help, as the whole film is grainy and shaken. <br /> <br /> For all the efforts Bigelow puts in accurate vehicles and equipment, there are probably clear errors and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the movie. <br /> <br /> - A car would not jump into flames after a single shot and once accumulated would not be turned off by a small handheld extinguisher. <br /> <br /> A single Humvee would not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in the event of a crash or attack. - It would be unusually unlikely to be able to hit a running upright man on a long range, where the ball clearly takes over a second to reach the goal. <br /> <br /> - I think bombs were brought to designated landfills on or near a base, not a random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The oil tanker is said to have taken place in the green zone, a very safe area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mainly offices and palaces with few homes, but it is portrayed as a dangerous war of dark alleys and lurking rebels. It is strange that James never gets into trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley on their own and thereby create kidnapping attempts. <br /> <br /> - Talking about which, 3-man team is always depicted clears buildings, chasing rebels, etc. alone, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead resident who hangs out of a window to find out he's not going to do it? <br /> <br /> There was no shotgun to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were other signs widespread. These are things the characters would know, so we should. <br /> <br /> Many of the "surprises" and scenes are completely predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist will come into trouble with the Iraqis, he tries to move together, that the choice of grain at home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the car. br /> <br /> Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a restless relationship at home, is ruthless and dependent on adrenaline. He's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? <br /> <br /> If this is the best so far in the Iraqi war movies, it is a sad thing. Just based on the half hour I saw it, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.
