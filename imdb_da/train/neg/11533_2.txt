If derivative and predictable rapists are your thing, then you are in for a rare treat ... They don't really appeal to me, so I couldn't find any thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems something right out of the 1980s, another age, as this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are doing OK with a weak script and a boring scenario. But what does Gillian Anderson do to get involved in a movie like this after the joy of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnesses of a rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a package of rural settlements turns Dyer. I don't think I was the only one in the cinema that laughs. What I cannot understand is the involvement of companies behind this movie - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some amazing independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers to make your artistic judgment? It's a big blut on both of your reputation. Listen carefully: Can you hear thousands of fans of independent British movies crying in despair?
