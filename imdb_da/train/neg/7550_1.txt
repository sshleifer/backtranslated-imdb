OK, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan, and I usually don't like British movies restored by the Americans, so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful movie experiences ever? I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan, and maybe I had some kind of moments of madness? The movie was appalling! Bite at the beginning with the crash / fire had no relevance at all to the movie, and the female policeman knew where Edward was heading, so little at the end with the two girls who visited the mainland, it had not happened as it would all have been investigated. The story behind the basket man was not really explored - and I assume being put in America did not quite help the pagan theme. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or tension. I must say that the best bit was right at the end when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames! I am in such desperate need to see the original again now to cleanse my disappointed soul. I really can't emphasize how disappointing this movie is, please see it if you: <br /> <br /> A) Dislike American re-husband of British Films B) A fan of the original C) Hate Nicolas Cage
