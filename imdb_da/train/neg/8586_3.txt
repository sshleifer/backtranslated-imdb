What a disappointment ... admittedly the best of prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of sets, poorly realized and glued amateurishly. There are many continuity errors that clash violently with the original films, and the advent of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed in many years. I will not complain about the unpleasant dialogue, as this is Star Wars ... the original three films had style, cult and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. Prequel's low attempt to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. Totally disappointing.
