*** Comments contain spoilers *** I almost didn't hold this show as Appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, as Don Epps was on average almost a shooting per. Case when the very nasal Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we shouldn't notice) and when Colby was of the ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, last night's episode, David is caught with a paranoid, nut job, an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and .... He can't disturb him. A trained, experienced field agent who has been through the door many times and has experience in hand-to-hand matches cannot take an emergency operation. Not when said nut job flashes, looks away, drops the head, closes eyes; not even when looking up at the fiber optic cable that winds around the ceiling as a stripper on a rod for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene, which tells me as much as I enjoy learning from chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged. Don gives David the "emergency word" which is the code for "S ** t is going down"; David is ready, they kill the lights, lose the elevator, scare the nut and ...... David cannot disarm / kill / turn in the submission NUT JOB. The bad guy ends with both GUNS, David quits SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS is fun.
