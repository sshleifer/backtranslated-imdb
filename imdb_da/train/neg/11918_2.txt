This seemed to be a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie I hoped it would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I must admit that the dramatic talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable, but in spite of the best efforts, this film lacks effectively conveying a meaningful message as it seems it seems what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point comes short, and the end seemed a little unsatisfactory after all that happened; A bit like real life in that respect, but movies in contrast to real life end in about 2 hours, and the end must give the audience satisfaction if it really was the director's intention. This does not fall in this respect, and that is what disappointes me most. <br /> <br /> Another concern that worried me was the national stereotyping of the American characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block. It seems to me that most American characters in Indian English films are based on how ordinary Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like, and it is clear that no effort has been made to get any sense of depth or complexity for anyone Americans in the movie. /> <br /> These two aspects are put together into a disappointing story.
