I got the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday, and people always say that the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it is soon. <br /> <br /> The action in this is terrible, as I expected from a movie with Shaq playing a magical rapping genius coming out of an old ghettoblast (which was probably a good reason he was caught in there) . The child in the movie that plays Max is whiny and a horrible actor. He is bullied by neighborhood children, whom I do not owe them because he is a small shower bag. The story is simply stupid and extremely clich√©. About a boy who is a father always and never around, who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him to reconnect with his father. Even though I was 8, I thought it was a stupid idea. It is a surprise that some of the people working on this film had careers for departments because it is a nuisance and should never have been made. I could go even further on how this movie sucks, but you should already know just by reading the plot.
