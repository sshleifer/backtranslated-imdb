In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee obviously has a lot in his mind. He thinks of racism colorism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "heterosexuality", drug war policy, etc. ... The level of awareness of one's own is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our society. But just because Lee makes contentious movies, he doesn't make a good filmmaker. What comes to "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely due to two main errors: <br /> <br /> First, Lee simply tries too hard. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate any political / social opinion he can think of in 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confused and effortless as he does not allow time to develop characters that can fully represent the ideas he hopes to present. And then he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with hasty testimonies and very loaded dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. Secondly, he does not seem to have any concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues presented by trying to make statements about so many different social functions. What comes across is a pile of regurgitated non-sense. You feel he bought an elementary school sociology textbook and spewed out all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are very problematic features because the film's artistry is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a speaker for the voice of the filmmaker's voice. He is unable to abstain from work and allow it to speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It doesn't work either as a work of art or a solid political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate Lee solving these important issues, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
