It's about to see, can't say I was impressed. It starts quite well, the visual and the atmosphere give a frightening feeling, as this type of film should. But it all ends when the first lordi monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the band lordi, but they are seriously wrong in the movie. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are the 80s. <br /> <br /> With regard to history, it begins as a similar horror movie, people trapped inside a hell hole. But there is no clear story about why and what happens. The viewer is thrown some lines for possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up with anything but a mess. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie with an exciting start and some good effects, I thought someone would have taken better care of the product. I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their exhibit suit can be scary (except they don't). <br /> <br /> So the movie becomes credible for the pictures, I think the money was going somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to scare their on-stage monster aliases.
