Let's say that. I actually get this movie. I get what the author / director tried to do. I understand that the dialogue was meant to be dry and numb. I understand that the plot should be non-climatic and outdated. That was what the author / director was on his way to. A very very dry humor / comedy. With all the understanding, I still think the movie is sucked. It seemed like the author / director was trying to recreate Napoleonic Dynamite with this movie. It had all the same features. Even the protagonist behaved like Neapolitan. But Napoleon's Dynamite was actually fun. Its script worked. This movie is not. It has no meaning. Well, let me rephrase it. The only purpose is to tear off Neapolitan Dynamite and try to capture that look. Too bad it didn't work.
