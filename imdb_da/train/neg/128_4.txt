This film, once sensational for its forward-looking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced over time to pure curiosity. It seems absurd now that this most boring little movie had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Considering how socialist Sweden eventually became, politics 'radicalism' once looks controversial, so it is naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time subject to sensational obscenity trials, look rather tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries describing its many controversies and influences remain marginally visible as an early relic of the 60's youth rebellion. Part of the movie that still stops: its self-awareness of the fourth wall. Every time, the films are filming themselves by making the film. The satirical play of this still evokes a chuckle.
