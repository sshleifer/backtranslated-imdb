After coming from the first you think the roads brothers could bring some new jokes. Although I don't guess it. If the first one was not bad enough, it is just so bad that it hurts to see. With all the actors they had in this movie, you think they could come up with something a little more wise. Though they could not, they had to take all the same healthy, not fun jokes from the first and somehow put it into this movie, thinking people would laugh at it again. Although I do not laugh the first time. They tried to make these movies parody, even though they failed at all levels. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to see and enjoy it. So when they try to create scenes that are movie parodies, they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with perhaps a joke within the entire scene. Also for people who say that it is not for the older and real young audience, I fit into the age group that it should be fun too. While people say that different people have different ideas about what is fun or not, if you find it fun, you're probably not one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take much skill to write that kind of script, but if you want a smarter and more fun movie, watch the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that is actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and healthy jokes to make it fun either.
