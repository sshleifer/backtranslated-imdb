What in a D movie was that? Bad plays, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / history I ever came across. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice cameo like a freaked out cop, but the rest of the movie is horrible and boring. It's not even that bad you can laugh about it. Just plain crap. And who compares this to the evil dead series may as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (okay, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
