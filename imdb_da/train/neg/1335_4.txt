This movie was amazing !! (Not quite as good as Leif Garrett's masterpiece Longshot) but still great !! I thought Ashley looked freakin tremendously at Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would think they could swith places like that and almost get away with it. Dad was a little shaking though, and Mother was a little too chummy with Helmit Head. I give it 4. Anyone who likes this movie shoudl check out Longshot.
