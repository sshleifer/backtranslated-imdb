... that is not exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Surely, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss bag that used the whole movie to cry if his little brother is eaten by DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better, and the play was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile resembles a children's model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. becomes a shipwreck on a desert island where they encounter a refined group of ugly Filipino natives trying to force themselves on the women of the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of movies. And 3) there is not enough croc time. There are a few redeeming qualities of the "Blood Surf" - the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the hook towards the end of the movie. But if you are on your death bed and only have enough time to see a Matt Borlenghi / Killer Crocodile Movie, skip this one and lift "DinoCroc" instead.
