I really don't understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is warm but horrible in this movie. But I don't think it's her own fault, but the directors. He has somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their action, idea, makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this trouble, go see a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
