The final of the Weissmuller Tarzan film is quite weak. There are a few things that track this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan uses a lot of the movie wearing floppy sandals. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, whether it's sandals or boots that sometimes depict, takes away from the character to be assumed civilization and jungle. <br/> Secondly, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, completely obscures the film as the comic book. For me, his character is unnecessary for the movie's plot. <br /> <br /> Also, while Weissmuller still cuts an upcoming character like Tarzan, it's obvious he wasn't in his best shape. Although in his later Jungle Jim movie, his physics had improved something from this movie. The Octopus Battle is a great idea, but I think it should have been done in a previous Weissmuller movie when he was on his physical top. Similarly, the match, which only takes 30 seconds tops, will be much more exciting if it was pulled out for 90 seconds to 2 minutes as the classic giant crocodile steering in Tarzan and His Mate. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly grateful for the eye, failing to save this last Weissmuller movie - a disappointing end to a great character drive.
