I gave these two stars the amazing DV shot clarity that gives the cold and dark sterility of its character. It was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie fails on all accounts. I cannot recommend this because it is neither poetic nor blunt. Neither dramatic nor exciting. Neither controversial nor ordinary. It's just a miserable piece of trash can that no thrill or tab can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Don't see who you are. . You just want to stay away from this horrible product. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
