Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in Ed Woods style (without heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very poor (piano and orgue ... come on!). The action is ... and there is no action! <br /> <br /> There is a guy who actually goes in the woods to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat, rude clown that couldn't run from a turtle! <br /> <br /> All members of the cast are stupid and the director puts all the cliches of slashers in the movie without effort. <br /> <br /> The end is so far the most stupid ever made. Think about it: The guy (ken hebert) who acts skillfully is about the same as his writing (he is the brain behind this flop) inviting a colleague and two of his friends to his hut for the weekend and killing them. .. On Monday morning he goes back to the office as nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr.Hebert is trying to make us believe it is a family affair that goes on to the generation (his uncle is the clown killer) <br /> <br /> So of course, no police will ask him after his colleague is missing ... <br /> <br /> WHY. <br /> <br />
