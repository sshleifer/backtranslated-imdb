The idea behind this movie was a good one. Too bad it wasn't written well. Casting Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea and he did an excellent job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only a feeling in most of his films, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could have been a great one and even showed some options once, but the author really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless woman. This was totally incompatible with the highly independent character she was supposed to be. I don't care about Alley's play anyway. The movie should be completed about fifteen minutes before it did. The director milked the cow dry before the incredible last action. I will only keep this in my collection as an example of Poitier's performances.
