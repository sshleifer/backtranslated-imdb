To learn the basics of quantum mechanics, use your $ 9 on a used textbook, not this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I don't think the directors really have any points across, but it seems that maybe they were trying to do more: 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning our life is deterministic; 2) Science cannot be used to explain everything we do, which means we have free will; 3) Science is like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow, and 7) here you have to put this little trash in your mouth and you will see some really groovy things.
