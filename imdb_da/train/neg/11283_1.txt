I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a total waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely dubious accents. The camera work was somewhat experimental in places, and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to see. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the overused narrative throughout the film, almost as the whole plot is dictated to the audience. The best performances were nothing to do with. In fact, Dani Behr's most convincing performance was of all people, though it does play the stereotypical office secretary. DO NOT go under any circumstances and watch this movie unless you need a reason to catch some lost sleep, there are probably better ways to spend your hard earned money.
