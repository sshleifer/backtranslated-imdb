In one word: rude. I was recommended to read some articles about the film's philosophical meanings afterwards, but after sitting through the film's interminable 115 minutes and slowly crushed under the inflated symbolism and lava flowing repression, it seemed better to just report my reactions to the movie. After all, who is going to watch a movie with a curriculum in hand? And this flick was gloomy. Leading actor Claude Laydu, from the film's opening to the end, carries the same tiring and annoying mask of pain that it can hardly distinguish from the film's eternal, boring voice-over. Films over each other may have worked better than submitting to an audience for both, as they largely say the same thing: Ambricourt's priest is a miserable man. The story of a persecuted priest trying to help a troubled family, does nothing to make his characters extremely interesting or sympathetic, as the family is a bunch of unpleasant beings, and the pastor himself comes across as a new spouse. The last 30 minutes suggest a breathtaking message of grace and a person's suffering similar to that of others, but because of all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtitle of Robert Bresson's script, all I felt was. Finally, it's over, let's have a little ice cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fanatic Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of character and attitude, Schrader introduced in his own writings and films, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
