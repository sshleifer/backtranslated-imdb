To die for (1989) was just another death function that emerged on cable ad nasuem in the early 90s. The only thing remarkable about this feature was the last movie Duane Jones showed up. Otherwise, there is no need to watch this vampire girl unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror movie. A tired vampire longs for love and seeks the back streets of L.A. looking for it. Will he succeed or will Vlad just knock out again as he has in the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie must have been great because a few followers soon followed. They are so bad that they make this look like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires, but the filmmakers could have used it for lighting. <br /> <br /> Not recommended by me because I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
