Imagine making the American people a cartoon. Throw a few cute animals, some horrible puns and a few roller skates, and you'll find yourself with almost an exact copy of this movie. I remember seeing this when I was younger; I made my mother rent it from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not that bad, just because some Marxists look for something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you don't like America, you won't like this movie.
