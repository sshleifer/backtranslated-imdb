This Charles excursion is decent, but this is a pretty low key performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a partial plot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland who forget to develop and it hurts the movie a bit. I'm still trying to find out why Charlie will change his name. Every movie with "Charles" has been pretty bad.
