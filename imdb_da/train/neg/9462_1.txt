Inappropriate. The PG rating this movie gets is another big mistake in MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13, but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't get fooled, taking a primary school to this movie is a big mistake. There were many times I seemed to be uncomfortable, not just because humor was inappropriate for children, but also because it was completely out of the blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a horrible movie. The film's casting and overall appearance are the only savings. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always sympathetic (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles, although Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors, and especially Dakota Fanning shows. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that allowed me to see and not throw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely regrettable. I didn't like him as Shrek's voice, and I really believe now that Myers shouldn't be allowed to get close to children's movies ever again. His depiction of The Cat is a slightly toned version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have been gone, but he came, although just for one day he destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and battle. The cat in Hat can be the worst youth movie ever.
