This is one of the worst B slashers I have ever seen in my life. The end is something you must look to believe. The movie starts with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sits on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down in the chimney while they are dressed in a Christmas gift. He puts the gifts under the tree, eats cakes and milk and then goes back up the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry only comes down to find his father dressed in a Christmas gown sexually caring for his mother. Then Harry walks up the stairs, smashes a snow-ball, grabs glass and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then you move on to the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Christmas gift and sees little children through a pair of binoculars. He has two books. A book for good children and the other for bad children. He writes down everything they do in these books. The guy is a crib. He also works on the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a lovely house. <br /> <br /> When Harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits, he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few children. Then he travels to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts gifts under the tree. The kids catch him, but they go back to bed. Then Harry goes to the bedroom and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he walks toward a house, a bunch of children jumps at him and runs up to him. The parents are nervous and try to get their children back to them so they don't get hurt. How do they know Harry is the killer? Sure, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it might be. Harry gives the kids gifts and the father draws a knife in an attempt to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs out, the city's people light up torches and follow him to kill him. They don't even know he's the killer. When Harry reaches his brother's house, his brother and he have a little talk, and Phillip strangles him. He only loses consciousness. Phillip puts Harry back in his van. When Harry wakes up, he takes off. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is something I couldn't believe. Once again you have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bugged me was the black santa. It was true, the man in the Christmas gift they saw was a white man. So why did they bring in a black man? <br /> <br /> Skip this and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Kill. You get your money's worth seeing the two movies. They are better than this pile of waste! I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what this movie deserves.
