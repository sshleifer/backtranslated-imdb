Bill Boyd's slave, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Coney Island Carnys, who are pounding by Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells saltwater staff. With the outbreak of the First World War, the triangles penetrate and pursue Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production goes hard, with the three male leaders chewing the landscape with overcooked one-liners and "snappy" dialogue that quickly becomes tiring. The second half focuses on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German grocery spice and a U-boat. These sequences are lively and well-filmed, but in general this is an overgrowth and unsatisfactory comedy drama with a flat end. Only for fans of the stars.
