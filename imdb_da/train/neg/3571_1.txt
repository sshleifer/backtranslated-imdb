The super sexy B-movie actress has another part like the future "Goodfella" star Ray Liotta's boyfriend in this boxing battle. She plays Marion, has only a dialogue line, yes, a word of dialogue actually. She shouts out "Joe!" as Ray's character, poor Pia Zadora brings a sprinkler with a plastic garden hose. This movie is so bad, even though it is fun, fun at times. The boys at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try to show how much Pia character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a writer? Yeah right. Pia can hardly speak, let alone write! Pia is totally and absolutely miscast in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is the warm and fresh Glory Annen in his little part in this cat's mind! Rock on Glory!
