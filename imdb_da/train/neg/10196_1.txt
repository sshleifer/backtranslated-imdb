As a poker enthusiast, I was delighted to see this movie - especially as it had Scotty the Nude in it. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Newbie's short spots in this movie are all it does. <Br /> <br /> The characters are unlikely and annoying, the soundtrack is terrible and plotted, it is not one. <br /> <br /> I honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was so boring. Its really ashame that Nyugen was in this movie as otherwise I wouldn't have wasted $ 16 buying it from Ebay. Take it from me - Avoid as 7 2 offsuit !!! Dire. :(
