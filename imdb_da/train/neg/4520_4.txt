Irwin Allen was great. All his TV shows had a great pilot or first episode. The rest was basically rip offs of his other shows. A few episodes of Swiss family robinson were rip offs by his older television shows. An episode of Swiss family is identical to an episode of the Land of the Giants when a party of the party needs an appendix operation. The show was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost touch with television shows after the 60s. The action is strong with Martin Milner. Kids stars coming, start with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. a bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption that duplicates him "master of disaster"
