(aka: Bloodsucker leads the dance) <br /> <br /> Lots of naked babies in this with a few lesbo scenes thrown in. The film will take place in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic to me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to a Count's Island lotion on the weekend. One by one, they seem to lack their heads because of a madman running around. It is not very scary or bloody, and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though the lights are on. Go figure ... (sic) Dubbing is worse than normal, and the plot only serves as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by euro horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 out of 10
