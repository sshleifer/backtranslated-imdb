was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie? The character, Leon, is funny enough, but shortly afterwards, they are sexual jokes and humor for stupid to listen to more. Some movies can get away with the sexual jokes and base their audience to know it properly when the advertisement comes on. Some movies that make this are American tart and scary movies. scary movies were stupid, and American pie would not have done well without the sexual jokes. The only role, besides Leon, who had some humor that followed, was, will tell. The character was really stupid, and that was all, the stupid sense of humor was everything I had seen. The movie was ok and nothing else. I really do not understand why the people who die to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. The sketches last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie out of a 5 minute shit, what is the world coming to? molly shannon had superstar, cheri o'terri had scary movies but she was not a leading role and will have eleven. but it was good, but he did some stupid movie, but I can't remember, and Mike Myers with Wayne's world. How does the wrong TV crew ever come with movie deals? seen only one guy break through, but only in similar 2 movies and a TV show with andy dick. But that guy is dependent on comedy for his life to continue, fun or not. this movie is not good but had some positive humor. what a waste of movies and people's money. (D D-)
