I watched this movie on a driveway in 1959. Until "Howard the Duck" I found this the worst movie I had ever seen. This film tried to combine the whole genus into one; comedy, horror, teenage anxiety and the hot rod that must have been "My mother, the car." Perhaps it deserves another view to see if it is an accurate reflection of that time.
