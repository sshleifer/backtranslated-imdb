I am stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this television movie a high rating they did. It's a harmless, sweet, uncomplicated clich√© of a movie that had two big names from the past in it (both of them did a decent job), but this movie series of the low budget work we can see any day of the week on smaller cable channels. I like a good romance as well as someone, but as my wife and I looked at this - and before we saw the review - we said: "There are people who want to rate this movie too much simply because there is nothing in challenging their brains, their beliefs, their level of comfort or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good film as such (and away from Hende is an example), but it was amateur time. much lower than this one, really, another in a wide variety of violently insufficient holiday movies, see the Family Stone, it's miles before this schlock.
