WARNING! Don't even consider watching this movie in any form. It is not even worth downloading from the internet. Each and every porn has more substance than this spilled celluloid. The so-called filmmakers seem to have absolutely no idea how to make a movie. They couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to every human being. If you're looking for a fun movie, look elsewhere. Let's hope this Mr. Unterwaldt ("Jr." is a good indication of his obvious ignorant and intellectual childhood) dies a slow / painful death and never makes a movie again. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time to WRITE NOW about this crap, so I stop right now and better watch a good movie.
