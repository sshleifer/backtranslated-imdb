When I saw the previve, I thought: This will be a great movie. And it could actually have been. The actor playing the protagonist was very credible, and the beauty of the film is undeniable. The dialogues, however, form a dark shadow on the whole picture. The language was too familiar and too modern for an action that took place in 1610, and it removed most of the film's magic. However, I must congratulate the translator because the English subtitles were more refined and appropriate to the original French signals, and that probably explains the good rating the movie received on imbd!
