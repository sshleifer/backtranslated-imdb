I was so disturbed by the real recording at the beginning of the movie that I felt sick in my stomach and ended up closing the film. How can anyone give this movie more than a rating of 1 baffles me. I know the film intends to shock, but shows the actual recording of a dog that had been shining alive (hold back the evening as I write) - PLEASE! I closed it after the stage with the disintegrating baby. I had my eyes covered most of the time until then. No wonder this movie was found on the purchase in HMV. I really have no desire to see any other movie of this Uwe person. Anyone who enjoyed it needs therapy. Period.
