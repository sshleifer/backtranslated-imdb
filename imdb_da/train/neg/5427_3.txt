A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looks like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) just goes with people she feels have wronged her using an old haunted mirror, which she finds in the new house she and her mother ( horror foundations, Karen Black, the only distant good thing about this travesty) purchase. The actor is pretty ridiculously bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there is no scary or excitement to be had. This film inexplicably formed so for 3 successors each a little more horrible than the last one. People seeking a similar theme but far superior cinematic effort would be well-informed to just search for the episode "Friday the 13th: Series", where a geeky girl finds an old damned compact mirror. It packs more chills in the sharp 40 minutes than this whole franchise has given across it's 4 movies. <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling provides the mandatory T & A
