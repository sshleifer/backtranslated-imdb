"A Christmas story" is one of many people's most popular movies. The ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and place in such a way that very few movies ever have. It had a sweetness and goodwill for what is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for his successor, "It Runs In The Family". The film was almost released a few times, only to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF (and I think) was a total mistake. <br /> <br /> The sets and cinematography were fine, but it was just right, completely missed the mark. The movie was nothing but a cash flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing and offline acting. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of America's great humorists and storytellers, forced us a fake rendition of the warm humor he used in ACS. He overwhelmed, and why did he do what I never wanted to know. He somehow managed to become an annoying, overwhelmed parody of himself. Scripture and action in IRITF are unauthorized and forced. The actors may have seen the ACS, but regardless of the whites and shades that were in the ACS, they should not have registered at all. The action was embarrassingly slapstick and deprived of any of Shepard's dry humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling IRITF a successor is insulting all the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
