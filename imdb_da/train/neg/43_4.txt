This video nasty was originally banned in the UK and was allowed last November with no cuts. <br /> <br /> It features Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle images. I'm not sure what the purpose of it was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly. The Ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes out alone to find Laura who has been caught now. They pass the time that has sex and do not see the father approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). Blood, beheading, bowel, lots of full frontal, some great twists of the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess) and the line "They tore out their heart", which is fun if you watch the movie.
