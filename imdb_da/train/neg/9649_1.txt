Who do they do with this? There was just too much in this movie that was difficult to digest. Right from when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wants death on his father when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) just to give him away minutes later. The only problem with that theory is that anyone who has ever passed London Heathrow knows that such a fête would be impossible to pull off and especially not an Indian. But the movie problems do not end there, there is the question of the two chiefs (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) passing as rock stars on the brink to reach their dreams. I mean yes, we saw success coming to Susan Boyle (a woman in Britain who reached her dreams after 50 years), but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just mistreated. They would never throw Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men well into their 40s) around desperately trying to hang on their 20s ? Let's not even talk about the most self-conscious actress on the screen today, Asin. This is her second movie (as I have seen) and she is just hopeless as an actress, so conscious of her appearance that she only cares about looking good and vogue for the camera rather than giving a good play. It's just hard to believe that she beat all the other movie roles to the star of this fluff and then be as fluffy as an actress, nothing to write at all about. And to top it all, the movie just went boring. There is nothing special about it at all, trust me, you will predict any clichéd thing that will happen in it.
