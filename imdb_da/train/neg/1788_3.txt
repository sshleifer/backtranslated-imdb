Giving credit where it is due, only to technicolor, costumes and sets deserves honest mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is about as clumsy as you might imagine, and neither the informal Bing nor William Bendix or Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to repair it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely silly on a side boy's wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a supreme ruling group that requires her to look adoringly at Bing and a little bit else except to transform a few uninspired ballads into a voice that is probably named for the occasion. Just awful! Mark Twain is not clear in any of the manuscript. Only dead-hard Crosby fans may appreciate this mess on a movie that is uninspired. Even the extra features look like they don't know what to do. <br /> <br /> Summary: Dull as dishwashing detergent. Not recommended even for children.
