A good idea, poorly implemented. While it could sum up 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, this is true. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and I like action movies, and I like all the key actors so it could have been good. Despite some good plays, this movie fails because of Bill Platt's poor writing and control. <br /> <br /> Another review made the good point of knowing where to go so you can get there. This movie doesn't. It is composed in such a random way that you do not find in Bill Plat's vocabulary at the word "second draft". There is a scene that is completely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing it. This scene even begins and ends with driving a car so you can cut from one car scene to another and have never missed the meaningless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This movie also had a strange habit of explaining some details while explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "plot" in front. It also had a habit of interrupting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle with conveniently placed "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what * is * it?). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's okay. She manages to break out of her "Roswell" persona a few times and provide a good hard chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has ever done since playing Q back in ST: TNG, so it's not new. Overall, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.
