Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror movie. Okay, it's not that bad. But it's close. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite threatening and brutal). I might say because she wakes up and that was all a dream ?? .. Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the movie is that these fifteen minutes of plot (done quite well the first time) are repeated over and over. And when Claire wakes up every time, and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternative reality, I just stopped breaking what happened to Claire and began to wonder what the lama twist at the end should pull this together. <br /> <br /> I was blushing for a s√©ance (which would honestly have made more sense), but instead one of them got obvious with half-surprise conclusions (think the village or below) Yup movie collapses faster than Donnie Darko's directors cut. All the big twist endings in horror movies The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience didn't expect a left field explanation. (Heck, although the canoe ended in the original Friday the 13th it was worth scratching) <br /> <br /> Salvage, on the other hand, screams the twist ending with each scene change. Other piano errors are the only notes piano soundtrack (although the songs shown were decent) the obvious time pudding (Claire does the dishes, Claire's mother's subplotter), as Claire says "hi there is someone" every time she thinks there is a serial <br / > <br /> Also, some of the secondary plays (especially Claire's mother, played by Maureen Olander, resembling a Mary Kay zombie) show the first actor low budget roots. <br /> <br /> Both too clever with half and not so good enough Salvation holds your interest if you can only see how to solve this mess. Problem is, they really don't.
