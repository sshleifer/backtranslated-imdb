Nicolas Roeg? He instructed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW did not he? Strangely, the aforementioned movie was broadcast on BBC TV at the weekend, which in the evening's screening of COLD HEAVEN does not favor anything. <br /> <br /> It is impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DON`T LOOK NOW as they both have the same instructor and same structure, and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I also thought they had it the same plot except a dead man had been replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, my mind was put on this movie, which was about a mournful widow who saw her late husband driving around in Venice with a red anorak. This does not happen, but about a third of the way through running time there is a massive plot twist and despite being an important plot twist it is not explained in any depth. In fact, very little is explained in KULDHIMMEN, which destroys the film <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the rather poor production values ​​of KOLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If I were not different, I would have thought that this was a TVM since it was made for TV, it feels right down to white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to inject art house performance through spoken thought processes, but again it doesn't help the movie at all. You can't feel that Roeg should have put his efforts into the plots that are completely flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, uninterested management and a truly bizarre performance and manuscript make a bad movie
