Hopefully scary and boring movie, where the characters are standing around in rooms or a rocket ship and talking endlessly. You may think things will be upgraded as they explore Mars, but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very dark. The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings, and the monsters are absolutely convincing. There are echoes of 'Bride Of The Monster' when the heroine gently blows octopus as a tentacle of a carnivorous plant around her before it weakens slightly, the difference being that the Ed Wood movie is a hundred times more entertaining. Better use of earplugs when you see otherwise "sci-fi" music scores, repeated indefinitely, will drive you crazy. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night, just drop it into the VCR and your insomnia will be healed in no time.
