Depending on your own personal state of mind when you see this, "Christmas evil" can either become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly paralyzed holiday-themed slashers ever made. Personally, I am tempted to choose the latter because I had no trouble doing any research and simply expected a cheesy and infinitely early 80s slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butcher human. Wrong! The movie actually handles a block named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a wild toy factory and thinks it is his responsibility to decide on Christmas Eve that deserves gifts and deserves punishment. Harry's problems all started when he witnessed Santa ?? his father in a costume of course ?? caress his mum's bare legs at a very young age. Then he developed into a social exhaust, much to his younger brother's irritation, which is bound to snatch a (holi) day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie, but has it really been so boring? There are several oblong and seemingly endless parts of the movie where nothing really happens. I can forgive gore and violent bloodshed, but this movie does not even enjoy a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly dented plots (with the remarkable exception to the finals I have to admit). I would also have taken the concept more seriously if the rugged protagonist would focus on killing the naughty children! He kills and not only abuses of adults. How do you take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller seriously when Santa doesn't even commit a miserable child murder? It would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic while now it's just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk.
