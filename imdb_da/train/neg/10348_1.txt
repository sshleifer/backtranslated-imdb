I was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever. I didn't realize it was Disney before it was too late. I was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of history. It was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th degree book report on the novel. Meg did well in school, and neither her nor her father had glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed so much by a scientist at all; they left their kitchen lab and replaced it with the internet. And that's just the beginning. At halfway through the film I found myself shouting at the screen, much to the dismay of the other people who saw the film that had not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs down for this. The only good thing I can say is that for someone who hasn't read the book, this movie is pretty okay.
