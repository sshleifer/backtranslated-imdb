One of the worst movies I've ever seen! The action, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the line. In fact, I cannot say anything positive about this, even though I enjoy Swedish films. The fighting situations are so ridiculous that it is impossible to take it seriously. And when the main character just happens to lose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure if it was going to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good movie? Regina Lund is the only half-actress, but she disappears in a flood of ridiculous statements and incredible reactions. It leaves you appalled that someone has actually spent time and money on something like this ...
