Me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First of the actor .... wow ... the actor was the worst, the effects were also bad, it looked like a movie a college child made. The reason was pretty good, but it had been done. The thing that destroyed the movies the most was the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame I call myself an actor for him ... The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was fun ... so if you want one good laugh see it .... but apart from that ... stay far away from this one. I usually love B movie movies and such, but the one ... I don't know how it was transferred to being put on video ... this is the worst thing I've seen ... and I've seen something bad for them.
