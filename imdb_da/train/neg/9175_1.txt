It's about the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie matches the quality of such films as "THEY" & "Cabin Fever", but even they had name actors where it became short. "Eyes" in this movie appeared to be a 50 woman with a poor face lift. (only an example of the quality). I would have rated this film negatively if it was possible. Ladies, I must tell you that the men were not bad to look at, but not much. If you planned to watch this movie, I would highly recommend saving money.
