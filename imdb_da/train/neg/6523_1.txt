Take a moment to read my entire review. I don't know the movie itself - only the DVD versions available now. <br /> <br /> *** I would really give this movie another two stars. I mean, how could it possibly rank just 1 in 10!?! <br /> <br /> Such is an epic movie adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate battle scenes, gratitude for the Red Army, and an extremely faithful, scene-by-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult. but worth sitting through for seven hours - if that was what you saw. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can't see that movie - anywhere I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to see the RusCiCo DVD version - considered the best version available as it is the mailbox and restores scenes cut from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst movie prints I've ever seen transferred to DVD. The picture is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. It is almost acceptable if you curl the brightness, color and image level up to maximum .... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also inconsistent, blaringly high in parts, almost inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And for languages ​​it's a big problem for English speakers - the dual option has some good actors, and some really horrible ones whose performance congratulates and parts of the movie just aren't duplicated at all, slipping back to Russian and even French randomly. <br /> <br /> Subtitles aren't much better. The subtitles do not appear below the image, but just above it - some of the beauty (or what's left) hides in nature. In addition, the subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame given that the manuscript seemed to be so close to Tolstoy's real words), and the subtitles also seem to fall into parts. <br /> <br /> So even if you maximize the color, brightness and image settings, and unscrew the sound and select subtitles * and * English, you'll still get a movie that's annoying to watch and listen to. <br /> <br /> Can the content overcome it? It might have been, but in seven hours - who can stand so long? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday somebody will come together and restore this - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece - but for now I just can't give more than one star to something I've only been able to look at the first 12% off.
