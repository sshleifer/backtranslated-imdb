My personal hell's vision is locked in a room without the ability to close your eyes or block my ears and make this movie play for eternity on all vacant surfaces in that space. The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is. The most important thing about watching movies is the concept of "willing suspension of disbelief". . . It is impossible to do this in this movie.
