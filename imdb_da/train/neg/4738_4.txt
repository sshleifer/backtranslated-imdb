I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling history, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura Rocks!), Editing, and not mentioning the beautiful Aya Ueto that filled the section perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after I finally saw it, I felt that I had won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi relaxed, but it is completely 2 different films. The pace is much slower, the action is not as exciting and also choreographed, and there is not much character development. It was apparently aimed at the same guy who was responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if it is possible!) I agree with some other previous reviewers who say this was a lost opportunity, but if only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this submission, there is some beautiful Japanese forest landscape to look at while the slow action unfolds and We are introduced to short characters that are quickly turned off, even though the real bad ones are killed too easily without too much fighting. The battle with the Spider guy (right out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about on In the memorable battle scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climate fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us Azumi cape cam !! Azumi's rampage at the end was convincing, but Aya still does an okay job. She looks good in the robe ... but where did she get it? I don't think I'll see it here again and again! ... what a shame.
