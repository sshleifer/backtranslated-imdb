This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is his protagonist, is anything but "motherly". Okay, she was unhappy in her marriage and always asked her husband and children first. Her husband dies. She then goes to her son and meets this hunk who sleeps with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Until this part, the movie is okay. Not excellent, but it can be seen. The guy is charming and who can blame her? Okay, it's not very fashionable to sleep with your daughter's loved one, but let's blame it on the shock of losing his husband. <br /> <br /> She gets completely obsessed with the guy. I think it's the part where I started to like movies. She is always there who wants to delight him in an old fashioned way with snacks while working at his son's house (I think that's the only thing she's ever learned to do), as if it were the only way she could get his attention. The guy is of course not very interested (in fact, he seems to be considering sleeping with her a charitable activity) and instead of being offended by it, she continues to ask him to go to bed with her and to be good to her when he becomes very insulting. "I want to please you," she tells him in a desperate way while insulting her very badly. <br /> <br /> What horrified me in this movie is the complete lack of self-respect that the mother has for herself. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless lump" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to women's kindness. If it had been me, I would have bought myself a small item that would have given me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
