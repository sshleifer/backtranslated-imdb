Man oh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But it is a guilty pleasure from my childhood, even though I hate to admit it. They constantly showed this movie to my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right at the Cupertino border) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they showed almost the same movie over and over again and again. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. I fell in love and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her drowsy adventure in the Grand Canyon of the 1940s. The scripture makes almost no sense, the direction is bad, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda looks, a lot of dialogue that is so bad, it's good, and a good Carole King song is played over the final credits. Maybe you should be stoned to really enjoy this flick. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in the Grand Canyon!
