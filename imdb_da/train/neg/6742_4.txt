For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film based on the disadvantages of my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for the "Wedding Day" I can only judge the movie with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> I apologize to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I didn't see much chemistry between their two characters. The premise of the movie is a reverse "Pretty Woman" in which Dermot plays the role of Nick, an affordable male escort employed by Debra's character Kat, to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship probably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship between Nick and Kat. <br /> <br /> In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a standout like Kat's sister. When Amy came on the screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams had been thrown into Kat's role, the movie could have had more dynamism. But as it turned out, instead of reaching Kleenex, I searched for Visine in an attempt to at least pretend that this movie had some real feelings and romance.
