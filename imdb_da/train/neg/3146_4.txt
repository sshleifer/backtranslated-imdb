The author of the book, with the same title, should not have used her name for this movie. If you have read the book, this film takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have a rather small joint except for the title and some superficial details. The film adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the book's own literary performance. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book, you will also be disappointed. The plot does not only move at an incredibly slow pace, it gives nothing more while moving slowly (like character development, for example). Some viewers may be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later in the movie, but you might as well see a special show hour for the things they show in therese and isabel - it's pretty tame and not imaginative at all.
