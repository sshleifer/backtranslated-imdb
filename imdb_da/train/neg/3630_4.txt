It must be assumed that those who praised this movie ("the greatest recorded opera ever", I have not read anywhere), do not care about opera, do not care for Wagner or do not care about anything except their desire to stay cultivated. Whether as a rendition of Wagner's swan song or as a movie, it strikes me as an unimaginable disaster, with a read reading of the score matched with a tricksy, lugubrious realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that people with ideas of what an opera (or, for that matter, a game, especially one of Shakespeare) is "about" should be allowed anywhere near A theater or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "about" bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter phase is transferred to some kind of beatnik babe, although one who still sings loudly tenor - get, if any of The film's actors are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, seen as Amforta's face (but not heard like the voice) and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the game of the good Friday music - by the way, the transcendent legality in nature is represented by a proliferation of worn and relaxed crocuses, stuck in badly laid turf, an appropriate one that baffles me. In the theater we sometimes have to hand out such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can't imagine why Syberberg couldn't split in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain grass as lush as it was set for Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music. . <br /> <br /> The sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets possess especially a sound reproduction that adds another form of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired leading and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, although his tempi is often very slow, had what Jordan lacks, a sense of pulse, a sense of music's ebb and flow - and after half a century, the orchestral sound in The set in modern press is still better than this movie.
