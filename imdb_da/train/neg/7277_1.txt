"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst movie ever made and even surpasses the unclear "Plan 9 from outer space". At least that movie was just inept; The lampoon film, on the other hand, is both unfortunate and transparent. Once, films used to respect their audience's intelligence. However, this one has a greasy rotting body for our faces - and then tries to rub our nose in it. Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the naked scenes; And I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash a little meat, and very nice meat is it. But the directors do not seem to realize that even T&A needs a good story that surrounds it. There is none of this here. <br /> <br /> Lastly, Perversely saves the filmmakers the worst. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an avid beaver young policeman who reports duty on his first day at work. He is paired with a tired, cynical old-fashioned game by Richard Widmark. For a moment, we hope that this movie ends triumphantly. Surely we think the youth's spunky attitude rubs off on the cynic and changes him for the better. Lost hope! Instead, the cynical day wins - and the kid's spark is doused forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and leads to the right of the toilet and asks us to follow it down the drain. Nominally this is a comedy. But where is humor?
