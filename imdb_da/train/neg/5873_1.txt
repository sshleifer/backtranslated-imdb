I don't know what they were thinking. of them, I believe that someone himself is far away from this disaster. I've seen such bad movies, I've seen such really bad movies, and then there is this. But I want to say one thing. who wrote the script has had to put what might be the most in-depth dialogue on the screen. It's not good with this movie, either from a technical point of view or from another point of view. as it allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired immediately. There are a few fairly well-known names in this movie. Actually, I hesitate to use the word movie.it more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and do less than 0 sense.anyway, i fail to see why anyone with any dignity would seem in this. I got it really cheap and I was still torn off. even though I had received this movie for free, I would still have been ripped off. This is an absolute 0/10
