This movie is just another average action girl, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out, they really need some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made the brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have made the stupid action sequences something special. Because the rest of the movie was okay - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the last scene, the show-down, the one we had been waiting for, but was like seeing something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, no hits, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - the same old, same old one.
