Maybe I couldn't find the DVD menu option for PLOT: ON OFF. It is clear that the standard is OFF. When the final credits started rolling, I couldn't believe it was. As our poor but beautiful protagonist, I felt used, dirty, inexpensive .... The characters were drawn in very broad lines, and the author's contempt for rich thatcherites was too obvious. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat" but would appreciate a little more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find an opinion or message in this image. Alas, not me. The only thing that kept me from giving this a "1" was the beautiful landscape, human and plant.
