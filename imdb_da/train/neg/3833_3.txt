This movie is a travesty and is not suitable for keeping the company with the superior original. The reason is an absolute mess, and the film is too long. Each time they fight, they desperately skip a sentimental reminder from the first movie. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the 10 best British movies all the time, one is horrible.
