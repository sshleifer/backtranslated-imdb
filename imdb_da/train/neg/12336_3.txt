I give this five out of 10. All five brands are for Hendrix, providing a very decent set of his last day material. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera's work and editing is fighting at the awful! We have countless facial shots of Hendrix, where he could almost do something and maybe take a pee? We can't see his hands on the guitar, that's the point! Also we get lots of shots from Hendrix from behind? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fighter drives them all. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be eager to walk his focus noisy about the scene as if Hendrix on the guitar is a pure distraction. While the guy behind is more aware of getting some chickens in the stalls than documenting the incredible guitar work that blows out amps (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of students losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun , full movie play! If Hendrix had lived yet another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. The one gem it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a pretty bad visual document by the great man and subordinate to both Woodstock and the Isle of Wight
