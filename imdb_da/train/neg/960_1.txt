Oh God. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of Japan's Ring. Well, I suppose the US also made their version of it, but at least it was a pure remake. So so sad. I enjoy watching Filipino movies and knowing that some good things can come out of a small country so I can't believe this was happening. Claudine and Kris are so big names there, surprised that they would be associated with plagiarism. To any aspiring film makers out there in the Philippines: You don't have to bend this low to make money. There are many movie buffs that watch the movies Filipinos put out and enjoy them!
