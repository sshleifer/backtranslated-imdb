This could have been interesting ?? a Japan-set haunted house story from the point of view of a newly installed American family ?? but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and unsuitable for both cast and director. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, ie. that the spirits turn out to be evil without any reason other than what they are expected to be! Moreover, does it not provide much in the deviation department? a huge crab attack is just stupid ?? which generally ghosts occupy a particular character and causes him or her to act in a completely uncharacteristic manner, such as Susan George's seductive diplomat / friend-to-family Doug McClure and Edward Albert, who tease their daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At one point, an old monk turns up in the house to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there ?? Eventually, he is invited to expel the premises. However, history has to repeat itself, and the tragedy is the only result of the tense situation duly created? leading to a violent but unintentional fun climax where Albert and McClure, obsessed with the possession of their Japanese predecessor, engage in an impromptu karate-duel to death! At the end of the day does it appear as an innocent period? tolerable in only 88 minutes, but by no means essential display.
