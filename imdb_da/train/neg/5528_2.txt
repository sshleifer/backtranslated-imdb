With this movie running only 61 minutes and not so well on television, I decided to revolt the zombies into the DVD to pass the time. Even with realizing the era from which it came, I was very disappointed. It started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening result (what - no brooding music?) And then the rather slow moving opening sequences. Gosh, I figured a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have some chills for it (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, made it safe), but it had none. Zero. It was hardly even dramatic (except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate hypnosis of someone). As the equally boring Zombies King, this movie can be an interesting curiosity to own, but no more.
