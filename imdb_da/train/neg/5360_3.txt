"Nada" was the most insufficient follow-up to "Les NOces Rouges", which gradually emerges as the last good movie of Chabrol's golden era (1967-1973) "Nada" is Chabril's first genuine attempt at a completely political film; Its previous work "Les Noces Rouges" also had political elements, but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassador, hostages, much blood, not really Chabrol's field. A heterogeneous cast gives the film coup de grâce: only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel is up to scratch .Viviane Romance, a of Duvivier's actresses ("la Belle Equipe" "Panique"), is wasted as a lady (Gabrielle) .Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are horrible. <br /> <br /> With "Nada" this is another period of barren inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violet Nozières" before he was again at the top of his game.
