What a bad image of professional police officers is shown on the television in the monitoring of this alleged reality show. One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause leading to the overall circumstances involved in making a "stop" so "Pat down" on the outside of one's garment so that being able to articulate why the officer went into a person's pocket and fetched forgery was cut out of the scene, because if that were not the case, the arrest at most places would be thrown if they even had to pass a supervisor. An announcement of a ruling on the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the order unless the person who dispatches has the original order in hand. If the sender reads from a computer print, it is good enough for arrest, but it does not necessarily mean that the warrant is still in force. Since I haven't seen a Dis-Claimer from CBS (I may have missed it), CBS could be in trouble.
