This is the worst movie I've ever paid to watch, and with the exception of "they saved Hitler's brain" the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore expect what I thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced, as it did not have the limitations that TV improvisation should handle. <br /> <br /> The authors must have thought that we will throw some gravity, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex and hi, we have a risky freak, ridiculous comedy. The game showing sketches is nothing more than cheap unthinkable take offs on Let's do a deal with stupid gravity. Seated com starting with the only girl and her boyfriend was simply poor poor high school humor. The Stun gun advertisement was appropriate humor to Seasame Street. The LA subway shit was bland humor by means of tasteless bloody. The French chef blindly went out constantly "there is no difference" with a French accent was, well you get my point. The only fun shit involved the Chevy Chase, which lasted a full minute. This means that you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes I have read the comments about the whole country being stoned in the 1970s and you will like this movie if you are tall. Well most of the country was not stoned in the 70s. If the outrageous writers were stoned, it must have been on drowsy sinuses. There were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when I watched this movie. Of course, knowing how bad the movie was was not enough.
