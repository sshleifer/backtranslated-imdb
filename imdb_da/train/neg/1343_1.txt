We bought this movie from a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration when we previously purchased the movie No Big Deal and restored it. <br /> <br /> We expected this movie to be very inspiring so we could recreate it and put it on the tube. However, this was shocking. DRILLING is the most important word to come to mind. The bad effects and the script are not enough to make you see it. The main woman's body appears to be whipped out at appropriate moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. But it just makes you wonder, have the blown budget get her to take off her clothes? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a homemade movie, the shots don't even match each other, and the camera's work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional. I cannot believe this is sold as a marketable product. It's just living and unclear to see. The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
