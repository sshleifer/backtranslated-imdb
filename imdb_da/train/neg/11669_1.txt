I suppose it is nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a movie like this. With the sometimes meaningless surplus of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene without explosions, spooky language and corny one-liners. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take the long scenes without dialogue and boring, sparse nature. I'm sure they have to keep a lot of sense and insight, because the implied message is shrouded in bafflement. The action is bad ... gentle and pedestrian ... and has one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the movie if you can sit through it to the end). The landscape is dull and the ridiculous sequence of the girl walking through the rugged park is so comfortable to have a tooth drawn. I would call this anticlimatic, but when the film didn't build on any kind of climax at all ... not even in the "erotic" scenes ... it would be untrue. I'm sure there was a script that was used during the movie, but with the amount of dialogue I think it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie offers nothing to interest or amazing ... no good story, no great insights, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three entertaining moments, this movie is a waste of two hours. A tragic boring and sad movie.
