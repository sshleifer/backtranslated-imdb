Bashki should be congratulated for trying to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then stupidly fought for this experiment. The animation was bad, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the movie was a ramshackle flash through the first book and a half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my pure disappointment and disgust for the movie when I first saw it. Now, I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of history, is just pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
