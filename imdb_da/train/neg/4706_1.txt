It's true you've heard me, this movie is a freaking 'ABOMINATION. First, the band, who in the hell should watch or listen to a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name terrible, but it's also the musicians, they can't even play anything! Also the leading singer sounds more beautiful than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! Not only are they terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Led by a crappy instructor and a thin plot, this must be the stupidest movie ever. I wish this site would let you use a voice on ZERO or WHERE out of 10, to give this filth a 1/10 is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call this a comedy movie. If you're looking for comedy with music, go to the "Weird Al" Yankovic guy, for he does it much better than these unlikely tweens.
