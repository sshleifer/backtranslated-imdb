If you can do that through "classic Meyer" titles / intro, you can wade through anything. But would you like to? I didn't find much to dig my teeth. I suppose if you go into it with low expectations, you'll be happy (a la Charlie's Angels.) But for my money, I'd like a little more, more visual, more moving. More. I would like to beg for the gruel @ master's foot. The men got the goods. but he just doesn't want to share.
