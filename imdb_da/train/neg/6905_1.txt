The clich√©dic Polynesian men drink, struggle and make a stream of sexist, stupid and unfunny remarks. Real life polynesians are much more fun than these stereotypical, cardboard characters. The seemingly Samoan girl did not see or act Samoan, seemed more like the white female woman who has sex with someone on a whim. With weak as water stories, you can't say anything about the actor - even the most brilliant actors couldn't do anything about this script. It is sad to see Polynesian players willing to play such sad stereotypes in a movie with no good scene and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of kiwi taxpayers' money, which lost the opportunity to make a good movie about a living community. It is better not to make movies if they are as bad and thoughtless as this.
