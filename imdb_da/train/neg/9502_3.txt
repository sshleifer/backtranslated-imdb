This movie was bizarre, totally inexplicable and hysterical to see with friends while drinking in a large empty house. I really love the open things with Lisa wandering about lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger who is lost in some exotic European rooms, but maybe not in a low budget horror flick. Definitely get the end, where there are the strange non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out (in my DVD copy anyway). Don't try to understand it, just go and watch the strange bits ... which is all. Don't look at this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything to make sense. Really beautiful, though you might just give up on this and decide to watch a real horror movie, such as. Dead Alive.
