A big disappointment from author Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on the first season "Homecoming" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways. This bad handling of an exciting performance left me confused. The supposed "payout" showing generic aliens recovering something from the infected psychopaths brains was completely unsatisfactory and explained nothing. If the point of history was an extraterritorial "cleansing" of the planet for the human attack, why did they go about it in such an incredibly sadistic and misogynistic way? Why not just release a deadly virus to let Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of having the male population slaughter the females? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I watched, but it just became more pretentious and prominent. The religious subtitle seemed simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm should have thought it was deep in the weight he gave it. I like a lot of both Dante and Hamm's work, but it was just uatches.
