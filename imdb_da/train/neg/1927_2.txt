(possible spoilers) <br /> Someone has even asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to their 1957 Christmas classic. How Grinch Stole Christmas. He knocked them down and insisted that no one could do better than the stunning Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also his mind was bitterly writing the manuscript of the 1953's 5,000-finger Dr. T). Then the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still refused to sell the film rights. But with the general use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; She also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. She was apparently satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs Geisel, who does one of us. <br /> <br /> The film was given a budget of $ 123 million (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including adjustment for inflation), which, of course, went towards elaborate makeup, set designs and special effects (undermined <br> /> <br /> a bit of the pretty stupid movie). Unfortunately, none of this money seems to be devoted to a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Who did much better <br /> <br> /> use of a high budget). While television specially was a trim 26 minutes without advertising, this movie tries to fill a maturity of 105 minutes with more background information on Grinch. It turns out that as a child he was the subject of ridicule, including a particularly humiliating experience a Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that all our poor Mr Grinch is directly because of Whos. The problem is, it seems like a pretty long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging the story. It might not seem that bad if only Grinch was a little more ... Well, Grinchy. The character of Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated, was a bleak fox whose slender attempt to hijack the holiday season was undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of the heart. Carrey's Grinch is a tall, hyperactive oaf and sometimes a chew who, when he made the holiday `Cheermeister ', blames Whoville Square in anger <br /> <br /> (hopefully landed taste as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make Grinch more sympathetic, with all Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation). Whoville by Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk music, who in their hearts knew the true meaning of Christmas. Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; An obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensive <br /> <br /> hypocritical, as the film industry has benefited greatly from American consumerism and since this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising <br /> <br /> campaign. <br /> The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif, who embarked on this false Santa, is now older and wiser and constantly questions the false values ​​of Whos and tries to understand Grinch's point of view (her one big scene from the original is reintroduced, making it seemingly out of the Grade). She <br /> <br /> seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, making her a completely different and more annoying character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas should rather accept a lump of coal in their socks in the morning of December 25, than a copy of this overstretched, exaggerated, eerie, boring, hammered, rough attempt at turning the kids classic into a feature film. It shows once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation, and heavy enforcement are insufficient substitutions for charm, certainty, sincerity, and heart. The people at Universal were coming down on their collective knees and thanking God that this really bad $ 123 million stink bomb broke $ 260 million domestic, or they wouldn't be here today. In addition, it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!
