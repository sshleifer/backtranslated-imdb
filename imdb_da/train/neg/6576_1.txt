I totally disagree with the comments that said this is a good movie. This is a completely SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. History development is strange. Mia Kirshner switched from an innocent girl to a party-fun looking chick without convincing reasons at all. In addition, all the actresses too old to be college students - university students looked like about 30 years old - you count on the rest. I looked only for the first ten minutes and quickly began to look forward to looking for sex scenes. all sex scenes are paralyzed, fast and most importantly no frontal at all. All sex scenes are ridiculous, considering how many clothes they were wearing. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 out 10.
