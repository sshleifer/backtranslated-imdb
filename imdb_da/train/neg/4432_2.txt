Tatie Danielle is about a horrible old court that plagues her loving and ignorant family out of pure faith. There is a bit of subtitle that can revolve around France's colonial past, but it's mostly just Danielle doing things (deliberately giving up a little child in a park) that would soon make a man take his teeth up with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the play is fine, and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it is just so beautiful. God loves this movie himself. Too bad it's almost not as wise or fun as it seems to be. The only driving force in the show - sorry, movie - comes from Danielle to get nasties and nasties, and the only surprise comes from seeing the more unlikely ways she does here. That's right: Like in a sitcom, which is what this is, with the added bonus of delusions and a 110-minute maturity.
