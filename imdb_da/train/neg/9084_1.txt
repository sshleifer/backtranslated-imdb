This was the WORST movie I've ever seen! Molly (molly hall) couldn't shop at all! She had no feelings, it was quite blah as if she was reading out of a boring textbook. The clever child and the child who loves food (who were not worth remembering) was so annoying it ran me crazy. When it ever spoke, it was about scientific things or food. Molly's father did not show enough feelings that his daughter was missing. Police and Molly's father said the same thing four times. It was just awful. Everything was repeated too much. Beatrice should have had something bad for her to be so mediocre. I just wasted a moment in my life watching this movie!
