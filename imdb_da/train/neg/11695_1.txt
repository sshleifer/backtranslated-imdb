Calling a movie like "Thinner" is bad as calling the world around or Pauly Shore un-talented. No news, but how they got that way is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As for this movie .... The book was good although it was a tiny diversion of other stories from "watch what you want" genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by his father (Constantine from TV's "Room 222") to several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, does it start well, but why does mobster (Mantegna) involve? Why do automatic fires fire so much? Why make it so much dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy lore and such. <br /> <br /> But no, it shouldn't be. Remember, we are talking about Stephen King. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact, the whole film tells too much, feeling it should explain that each plot is turning to us. Not that I had expected "The Dead Zone", but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary", thank you anyway. A star at least tries to do a half decent makeup job. But the rest of the movie is back to being ... tell me ... "Thinner".
