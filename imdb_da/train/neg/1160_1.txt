This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's (I believe) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, his hard-fair coach, his girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who have persistent nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there is no character development, there is no one to worry about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could lead such a horrible movie. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
