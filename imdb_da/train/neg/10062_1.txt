Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do that for me? I can't believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this at the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to notice .... oh god ... where do I even start? The grounds sucked. The voice works SUCCESS. The animation SUGGET. The end really sucked. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK. And to Futuramafan1987, who said this was the biggest movie ever, you're a TOOL, PLAIN and SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone but ten-year-olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying to this day and thinking of the horrible tour of a movie .... and then there was Pikachu's Adventure ... not even getting me started on that horrible mess on a movie. It is truly one of the most boring experiences in my life. Don't go see this in any way. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Go out, find each copy of this movie as you can and burn it. Burn them all and then continue to rent a good movie like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even back to the future!
