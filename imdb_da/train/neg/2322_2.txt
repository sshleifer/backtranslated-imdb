I searched for video store everywhere to find this movie, the huge elvis fan I am, and I found it to be a big disappointment. kurt russel had most of the "elvis movements" down and the voice imitation was great, but the doubled in voice of elvis just didn't work for me. The voice did not always match with the Russian mouth, and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable. Also, there were so many freaking inconsistencies in the movie, people who don't know much about Elvis would probably believe them to be facts. songs are sung by him earlier than he actually recorded them when he got his first guitar, it is wrong, i'm quite sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not one with a big headstone read JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they skipped important events that it came-back-special, and pulled out some scenes for too long. If you want to see a good movie showing eleven in its primary rental, then it is like that or another elvis concert. Hearing and seeing the true Elvis preform is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and rent a good Elvis tab.)
