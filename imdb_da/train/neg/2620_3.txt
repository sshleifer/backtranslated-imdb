After watching the 1996 remake, I thought it was the most fun way to see Cruella De Vil's punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite fun, and in my opinion better than the animated. But there was actually no need for another. First of all, if Cruela returns, do not heal her and make her mad again. Just let her break away from prison and it's a rap. I thought it wasn't that fun. It should only have an original puppy that returns. I was expecting it to be fortunate when he was the most appealing, as well as having Roger and Anita back as well. But they decided to get a complete rework and addition not really a hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only three puppies and a parrot who thinks he is a dog (wise). Gerard Depardieu's part was meaningless. At the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is baked inside a huge cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor that attempted to imitate the same effect from the first. It just didn't work. It was too much over the top and not for fun. I really felt sorry for Cruella.
