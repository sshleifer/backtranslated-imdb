Almost from the word go this movie is poor and lacks conviction, but then again most people will struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this. The dialogue does not really flow and sometimes, in this case, is less (or should have been). This is also supported by odd scenes (such as the Cemetry slow motion hallway) that you think can lead somewhere but only seems to waste a few seconds of your life. The reason is a strange combination of gangster / situation comedy, which I certainly thought was a good idea at the time, but if there was ever a case for someone who needed to be honest with the scriptwriter, it was here. <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is okay but then he seems to have a character that always plays so I start wondering if he got a script or just filmed and told to respond as normal. Finally - humor. This reminds me of "Python (I think) quote about Shakespere, of his" comedies "- if he had meant it was humorous, he would have put a joke on it. Now I didn't see one. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - I did because I looked at it with a friend and hoped it would get better. <br /> <br /> It didn't.
