When I watched this movie cover, the first thing I thought was that it was made for video. The other thing that came to mind was how similar it looked to another horrible movie "Darkness Falls", the tale of this stupid witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was the masterpiece of this pile of garbage, and this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a little story to the witch or more as a meaningless introduction by two young children who want to go and meet toothpick in the hope that she gives them a shiny new bike for their tooth. The opening is filmed badly, and like the rest of the movie, it's certainly not scary. Currently the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter rents his house and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole will stay there. Cole meets a neighborhood child, and they talk about the foot of the tooth and how you do not lose the tooth or she comes to you. Unfortunately, seconds later, it seems that the toothpick steals his bike and knocks her tooth out (how ironic). Will Cole survive the wrath of the dentist, and her mother and Peter will be able to save her and revive their romance ... this is a bad movie you might find out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic movie is how undefined tooth decay is. They say she kills you if you lose your tooth but not. She is more like a serial killer who kills randomly and if you lose your tooth, you will surely go. She steals a bike, so obviously she is also a thief. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the toothpaste look? Let's see. She looks like a burnt offering, and she went around in the neighborhood slaughtering children. Hmmm ... it's almost like she's an exact rip-off of Freddy Krueger from the movies "Nightmare on Elm Street". And this is not the worst part of this horrible mess, the climax is. This movie may have the most ridiculous climax (Not literally ridiculous because I found it more morbid than fun) I've ever seen. Don't see this. <br /> <br /> Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3 and they both were in this, so apparently Scary Movie stars are forced to end their career with bad scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 80 min. R of violence.
