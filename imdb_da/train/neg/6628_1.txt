If the scale became negative, I'd be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director ruined any pleasure in this story. The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well all distracted from trying to remember what is the story. Oh, if the songs and dancers have not made you tear your ears off your head, first. The movie could have been made twice at. 1.25 hours, and it was pretty good, like "Seven Samurai", but the director and the author did not move, though the "townsfolk" finally find the backbone and will help. This movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - mentioning every aspect of this movie - it was BAD - probably the food from the catering company was also poor. I have never seen for 6 years watching Indian (bollywood) movies anything that is badly made.
