Not only was this the most expensive Canadian movie ever shot in BC, but easily the worst, never see the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and boy shows it. We are all made to be a bunch of super-paid dope fiends and morons. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and we are supposed to fund this bunk. Of course, the British character is normal. The rest is a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say "Norm !!"? The kinematics range from beautiful postcard images to dark indoor silhouettes. The actors always seem to be fidgeting. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is it the director's idea of ​​a cinema? Avoid this mess and check out some of the Bruce Mcdonalds movies. A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. You won't be forced to go to his movie after 10 minutes.
