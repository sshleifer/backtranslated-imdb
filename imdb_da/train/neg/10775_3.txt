This movie is horrible! It rivals "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassingly bad moments. I would have rated it lower than a 3, except for a few fun lines; but generally this movie was crap! It looked like they were doing it over a weekend in some bankruptcy somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the direct sidelines forever!
