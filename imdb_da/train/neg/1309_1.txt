This movie was extremely boring. It should be at least no more than 15 minutes. The pictures of children and animals that were killed were a little disturbing. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't write comments, but it was so bad to have so many good and good comments. I believe in this case that we are a step closer to honest assessment of this title. <br /> <br /> What more can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from an 8 hour sleep period. I think it's the very meaning. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep when you see it, do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again.
