I've been a fan of Without A Trace from the leading episode. I really can't express my disappointment in the episode last week. This is a real problem that too many African-American families have dealt with and continue to deal with. The lack of media coverage is crucial in the first 48 hours documented by a recent study. Enforcement, including local, state and federal, is also complicated. What was the purpose of promoting this topic and then throwing it to the end? Apparently, television can deal with almost any subject except RACE. This is shameful. Get it together or don't explore it next time.
