The guy who wrote, directed and stared at this shocking piece of waste should really consider a career change. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who funded this crap? There are so many talented writers out there that money could be better spent on. I think the idea is great, but the play, script and direction are just awful! The jokes are so funny, I understand they should take mickey. BUT do it in style, this movie cries out live sketches on Saturday night Saturday. Why do I say again why give studios money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER GIVE THE COMEDIC OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECTLY AND STAR IN HIS OWN MOVIE. YOU H!
