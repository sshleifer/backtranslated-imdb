Although I agree in many ways with the other reviewers comments. I find out that the action and the idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor" How this person has ever been in movies or on TV, I can't imagine. In my opinion, she would be better off at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low talent level involved in paying roles, ask the question ...... "Who does she know?" I would very much like to see this movie restored with some talent. I don't fail the author for the mistake of this movie to be worth watching.
