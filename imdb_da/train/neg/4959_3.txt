Remember the good ol 'animated batman show from the 90s? The one that people praised? The one that people of all ages could all appreciate? Who showed batman as a true detective instead of the Hulk in a suit? The one who had a quarrel you could relate to? Who had bad guys with real motives? <br /> <br /> Clearly, Warner Bros. do not do it. So drunk. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know about batman? Have they even looked at a batman cartoon before? Do they know Batman to be "detective"? Gathering 2 tracks does not show you a detective! It makes you a little intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout of an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Opening of credits'. Batman finds death release of where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds obvious / stupid way out of it. Penguin escapes. Penguin does something clear again. Batman follows. They make kung-fu (by the way everyone and I think everyone knows kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch is penguin. he gets knocked out. goes to arkham. (Note: It's usually another villain every episode). As you may have noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's at the old amusement park"! Yes, maybe he was there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I've already mentioned this, but ALL WILL KNOW THE ROYAL FU! EVEN MONEY! what do they think? (probably because it is from the people who made the Jackie Chan animated series) <br /> <br /> What is really worrying is that the show is just action. No smarts. None. If batman needs to think, he uses technology, so do some kung-fu. <br /> <br /> Hey, let's not forget the bad guys. Afterall, what would batman be without his rogue's gallery? <br /> <br /> Well, I have to say, kudos for originality. I don't think other batman media would have imagined joker and a fearless monkey man, riddler as an emo and poisonous ivy as a minor (which is a little confusing when you think, is not her sexuality thought to be her greatest strength What is even more crap, but each figure is a 2-dimensional, stereotypical villain. <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham without reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a power-hungry mad scientist obsessed with bats for an inexplicable reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. No reason. <br /> <br /> Note a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting one should be Mr Freeze. Do you remember the Emmy Award winning 'Heart of Ice' episode from Batman: The Animated Series? Who gave Mr Freeze motives for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over its original back story (mad scientist)? Who made him a victim with a goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin acknowledged that using it as Mr. Freezer originated in the P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Now, this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr Freeze a jewelry robber before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then being frozen and giving him the power to make things cold. He continues to steal jewels for no reason while he says sh! T lines like "Garden an Ice Day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they saw Batman & Robin after all. <br /> <br /> Hey, look at the bright side. This series doesn't make you feel bad for the bad guys, so it means you're a good person. Good for you.
