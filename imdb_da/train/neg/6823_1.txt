I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is, in my humble opinion, nothing but a cheap attempt to deposit the success of the cult for its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It seems that some manufacturers have gathered the remains of Koyaanisqatsi, quickly threw it together, put it all in slow motion, and got some pop entertainer under Philip Glass's pseudonym to quickly throw together banal background music that is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is a large number of common images in slow motion (if you watch them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you can see what I mean). What disappointed me most was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercially sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in an afternoon of a 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget about commercialism! See Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
