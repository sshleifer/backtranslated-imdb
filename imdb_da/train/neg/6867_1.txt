We can start with the wood business, but this movie is a disaster. Having grown up in NY, I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone who is familiar with society or the people. I am not even a defender of culture in any way and found this to be a Hollywoodized piece of garbage to fit its own fictional, ridiculous, cultural presentation and language that anyone who sees Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. This is a huge waste of time and, even worse, is not as interesting as the result is obvious, and the scenes in the confrontation are ridiculously bad. Who works this way? None. The writer's name sounds Israeli or something of the kind, but it is clear he has no idea about the subject he is writing about. Looking at his cinema, it's shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much real connection he had with society. Even mediocre movies like "A stranger among us" are better and closer to the truth than this boy. Reading this guy's credits is no wonder he has written scripts on all C-grade movies that somehow have stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this script is even under par for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
