"Everything a great documentary could be" ?? Yes, if you are deaf, stupid and blind. Everything but meaning, humor, visual style and interesting topic. Apart from that. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, the people. This is a movie that is completely unauthorized. An adventure doc without adventure, a war doc with no sense of war, a campy send-up with no trace of wit. It means nothing, feels like nothing, and bears the implicit message that definitely doesn't matter. No wonder it has so many IMDb fans! Of course, when you know of a movie staring at the great Skip Lipman, you will of course have no culture, no intelligence, no humor (except for a corrosive youth jokiness) and no recognizable human feelings? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet construction like "Darkon".
