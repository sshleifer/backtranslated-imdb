Cannon drew a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating (except dragon prop). Now, how was the long-standing studio known for Chuck Norris movies coming up with a complete lack of knowledge? Cases in point: The amateur play and terrible plot is a sign of reviving the medieval legend is no cure for any miserable execution. They actually went and made another inexpensive exploitation with hundreds of lusty bimbos just to make this look even better. For the two "Barbarian brothers," they certainly know how to make strange sounds than to become brave warriors so strong and brave enough to save their homeland. This is the biggest release of the potential I have seen from an "expensive" low-budget movie, and worse enough to let an ax pass through the beautiful print without mercy. All this followed an advertising campaign selling T-shirts based on BARBARIA! The movie alone makes a great souvenir!
