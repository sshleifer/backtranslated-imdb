A call-girl testifies to a murder and becomes the murderer's next goal. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious role here: his camera stumbles around the corners of a museum (after a long time over a painting of a monkey), divorced into split screen for artistic purposes, giving virtually its plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters both see a TV program about transsexuals and enter their (first) finals during a thunderstorm. "Dressed To Kill" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and give nothing back. Much of the actor (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre, and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own "Carrie" - not to mention "Psycho". The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a ghost of Hitchcock, not a tribute. Stylish in a cold cold way, the end result is clearly half-baked. ** from ****
