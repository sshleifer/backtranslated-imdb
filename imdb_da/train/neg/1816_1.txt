This movie is really brilliant. It ducks through banality to shed at such a speed that you do not even see good sense and common decency for humanity, to walk in dizzying past. But it doesn't stop there! This movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it jumps back to the shameless comedy: watch as the Kor the Beergutted Conan wannabe with over-abundance of neck hair stiffens his stuff swinging his sword as there is no tomorrow (and how he swung it , I'm really amazed that * was * a morning for him or at least for his beer boy. Don't miss this movie, it's a great drum through idiocy and pure bloody mindedness! And when you're done watching this, you dare the joy years (or the pressure of frustration with such a scary attempted tale) from your eyes, because some stupid f00l gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel!
