Bestselling author George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes on a task for Sports Illustrated. He has to go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try a position as the third string Quarterback. He is quickly discovered by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team finds it fun to cause stumbling in the author's determination to quarterback for a series in a real game. <br /> <br /> This movie is Alda's debut and also helped Karras leave the grid zone to perform. In addition to the 1968 Detroit Lions, the cast also includes "Sugar Ray" Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March leads this story based on Plimton's book.
