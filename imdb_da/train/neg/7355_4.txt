Don't make me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies, but probably already: Death on the Nile. Everyone has done this! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used the amazing talent in another of Agatha Christie's novels. I would say that all the actors' performances were fantastic. The sets were fantastic and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised at how terrible he was. I hope he does not see the way in 'real' life! I can honestly not remember other films, if all was the same. Somehow I don't think so. I thought it was quite a brilliant touch if Christie wrote it that way. I'd much rather have what ends and then wastes away in prison!
