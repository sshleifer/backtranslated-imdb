I'm shocked at how bad this movie is. As a pastiche of Hollywood's early 20th century artists, it puts a new, premature past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock and I never thought I'd watch a movie worse than them 2. Permitted they turned about a slightly different environment & period. Nevertheless, the intentions and results were unequal. <br /> <br /> First is the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard like CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they allegedly show. <br /> <br /> Well, the last picture show was a decent movie, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of Bogdonovitch's photos haven't been much better. Guess rubbing against Welles & Hitch & Ford bar a long time ago. Still good for hosting TCM itself.
