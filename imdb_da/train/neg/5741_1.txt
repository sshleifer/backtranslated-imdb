<br /> <br /> Whatever the budget, I'm a big-time horror / sci-fi fan, but having seen countless horror movies late on cable and video, this must be the worst of any movie. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that was shown over and over) and people running around screaming from the left, then right and then back again. It should have been with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes. Instead, it is pulled out very long. It is very, very x5 low budget. Many scenes were too long. The narrator sounded very amateurish as a random person out of junior high spoke. This is the only movie that judges lower in my opinion than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs Megalon despite their higher budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake through the entire movie in a setting or better yet, avoid it as if you were an undead brain-eating mob.
