Look carefully at the amazing selection of talent that is made together to make this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even cameos by Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They prove, in spades, that a saying that a good throw cannot save a bad script. The storyline requires so many troops from the audience that its independence should have exceeded even Hollywood standards. It's not very original, and the "twists" are pretty cruel.
