Sometimes it is always to do something for everyone that it makes something strange and modern. While I will admit that the film's design and concept was quite interesting, the performance of these ideas in a congruent story just didn't work. This movie was so damn slow and pointless, not even Robin Williams could save this waste. It's obvious Barry Levinson's dream fell flat on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.
