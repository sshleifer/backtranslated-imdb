The intention of the directors for these films is quite reputable, but his story of his productions reminded me that this may not come much to the core that other filmmakers would do. keeps his big 30-day television series in mind, but also counts in his MTV production "I bet you want to" who opposes his seriousness in some of the documents he documents and also expects his rather disappointing production "supersize me", I didn't have my hopes high. Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me anyway. as with "supersize me" after a while I asked myself what the accuracy of all this was. The main record becomes clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the playing time is filled with rather meaningless things and repetitive things that were already shown in the way or otherwise in the movie so that it wears out and becomes extremely boring towards the end.
