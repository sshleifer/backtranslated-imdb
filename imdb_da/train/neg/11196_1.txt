My friends and I went out after 15 minutes and we were not the first. Afterwards we tried to get our money back. The manager wasn't going to allow this, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. As you can tell, it was not a memorable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. Close second must be when I saw a double headline of Domestic Disturbance and Heist. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, you should not see the order.
