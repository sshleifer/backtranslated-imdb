I love the picture of the 30s and 40s in movies. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No master, nothing good about this. The only entertaining aspect for me was Colin Farrell's character is an insecure writer, and this play, despite tackling the juicy subject of racism, approaches the audience in the fashion of an ABC Afterschool Special. The only person who doesn't sound like he was "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> Stale access to a tired plot.
