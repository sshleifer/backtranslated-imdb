Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Let's get it right: This is a conflicting piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh * t on it. It's just a horrible movie. It is a urban wolf movie with some of the worst acts imaginable and a story as weak as any regular geek from an 80's high school drama movie. What's worse is that the bad Kane Hodder was pushed to play the giant evil werewolf. Can fk cking Hodder. Someone trying to make sure playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his movie career ... Yet former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and eventually she also becomes a werewolf. It is a kind of scramble drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it. But it has moments of almost eerie nudity. But it's about everyone. Do you want to know more? Ok, the werewolf is generally a nasty-looking black blur that slides around the screen. And when we are privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we are presented with something resembling a full-motion video from a video game made in the early stages of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The CG animation is really the primitive. Only good for horror hardcore fanatics who want to see small moments of nudity, surrounded by violent visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
