Happened to a copy of this. Not mine and if I had spent my own money on this, I would find those responsible and demand it back! All I can say is that this would be a terrible student movie. Any understanding of the film's medium is absent. The act is godly, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in tone of the character's response to the "ghost" is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the "glowing" reviews of this movie are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even entertaining bad. <br /> <br /> Ultimate Amateur! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
