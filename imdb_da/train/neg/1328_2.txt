This is a really silly movie in the typical 80's genre: action comedy. Conceptwise looks like Rush Hour, but lacks action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show, but he just can't act. He is horrible when trying to act hard - he barely manages to keep this mark smirk from his face as he says his one-liners, which by the way are not very funny. And seeing him run (even then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have the feeling that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started on the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.
