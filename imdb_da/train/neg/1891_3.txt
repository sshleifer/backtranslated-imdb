Documentary of nomadic Persians makes a treacherous passage of massive mountains to get their herds to grass. Seeing this silent, black and white feature, partially ruined by a twink-twink twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original show, is even more so than it sounds. The spectacular landscape is lost on a small black and white screen, and there is a complete lack of any kind of plot line. I loved Nanook in the north and March in the penguins, but despised this movie, regardless of the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulties alone are just not that interesting.
