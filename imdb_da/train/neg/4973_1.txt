I stopped five minutes when Beowulf got a double-shot, automatic armbue with sights on it. Not only do crossbows have telescoping sights, but Beowulf beats Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The horrible wood-like and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci-Fi Original Movies did not help either. I only got a few minutes before I felt my bile rise and decided to see I love Lucy reruns instead, it's really about all I have to say. But you might as well realize that it's a movie for television and just skip it. <br /> <br /> A travesty.
