I'm a big movie fan. I like movies of all types. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I understand that it follows the book closely, which means that not everything must be made in a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not ornate, they are mentally ill. The things that happen are not fun, they are disturbing; especially considering that they should be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated. Only Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less fun. <br /> <br /> I'll never get those hours back. I wanted to wash my brain after seeing.
