I read the book "7 Years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated by it. then I immediately took the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it back in 98, I liked it. Well, now I saw it again with full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how wrong it was all told: <br /> <br /> As they enter Lhasa, people begin to keep their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that this is the way to say hello in Tibet, to greet them back ... in the book, Harrer explains that sticking his tongue out is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet, and they can do it in front of the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! Not only the mother, but even the Dalai Lama herself wore glasses in the public. The book Harrer mentions that no one in Tibet had glasses at that time (sorry forgot the reason, but it is also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! and what about the heavy heavy lookalike that destroys mandala in front of the young "living buddha" ?? childish ... and tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothing not European designer suits! Why are so many events really done away from history just to fill the time with a fictitious love interest (the female tailor ...) that is totally insignificant? just like the whole story of harrer's son, rolf. There is no word about him or even family member of hares in the book. but it was OK for me, because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about harrier's person. It's about the Tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. And I bet Heinrich Harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for movies.
