A man brings his new wife to his home, where his former wife died of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich! Suddenly she begins to hear sounds and see skulls everywhere. Does she go crazy again or is the first wife to come back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the end so I won't spell it out. I saw it many times Saturday afternoon TV as a child. Back then I liked it, but I was young. When I see it now, I realize how bad it is. It is terribly acted, poorly written, very boring (even an hour) and has a large number of five people (one being director)! Still, it has some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is a bit scary and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric. There are also a few scary moments (I jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. All in all, it's certainly not a good movie ... but not a total disaster either. It has a little cult following. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-in version of it (it is paired with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It is in horrible form with jumps and scratches everywhere. It didn't even look so bad on TV!
