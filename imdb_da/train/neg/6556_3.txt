I bought this on DVD for my brother, who is a great Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to see it myself earlier this week. It is a reasonably entertaining piece that contains two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the most interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally jumps into Brian Kerwin (a regular married man with children) after driving his car in the back of his. After being initially hostile to each other, he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable driving. Romance eventually develops into tragedy when his wife finds out. What was happening at the end I was not prepared for, but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes some drama out of the plot. <br /> <br /> The second section involves an old Studio manager played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the director, but in the end, when asked to step down, they all realize that their career is going nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's time, but it's not that interesting and I'm glad this wasn't bought for me. I'm not a Michelle Pffeifer fan, but she was the only actor worth watching in this movie and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though, unless you are a fan of her avoid this as it is very routine.
