It is amazing that with all the countless crimes that have been uncovered and blatantly revealed by the door of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag Archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, there are still admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and still making propaganda to its advantage . It just shows Hollywood's moral depravity. <br /> <br /> In this movie, a psychotic killer becomes glorified. Needless to say, neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. The fact that both the director and the actor expect the audience to sit through this seemingly endless propagandist film demonstrates the tunnel vision they have regarding their subject of worship.
