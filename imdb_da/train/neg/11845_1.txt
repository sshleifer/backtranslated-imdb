... is the only way to describe this movie on topics that must be surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst laughs her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies as she believes she is in "Legally Blonde." The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst goes over to the point where you want to hit the screen and slam him. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except he plays Charlie Chaplin and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for that part? Hard to believe in this hoarse, uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but then again he hasn't made a watchable movie in what? 30 years? Sometimes there is just no return.
