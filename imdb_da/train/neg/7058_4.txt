I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expects a surrogate movie about the Columbine school massacre resembling Gus Van Sants ELEPHANT and certainly synopsis in the TV guide, saying that a student sociopath rebellion against the system gave me that impression, but it is a very boring movie how little happening, pay attention to yourself <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a Chicago high school student who decides to turn back on what he sees as an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is subject and the actor playing him Blake Shields is unable to decorate any shortcomings in the script. You have the intestinal feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never comes across as anything more than a sneaky trokulous teenager and it is impossible to believe he could gather some disciples . The subtitle of you overthrows one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulation regime is too obvious, meaning NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally convincing drama that is not worth going out of your way to see
