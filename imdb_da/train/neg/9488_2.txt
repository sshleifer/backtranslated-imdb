I've seen some very horrible horror movies in my time, and although this isn't the worst of the pile, it's definitely in the bottom half. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to the hospital as a trainee and hopes it will pour him into a better job for him and his future wife. Sweet huh? The movie then leads straight into the toilet when you realize that something kills patients. It turns out there is a demon in the basement that reaps people's souls. It is the task of one physician, one nurse and one security guard throughout the hospital staff to pull this mental patient downstairs, make a ritual that just means cutting the tongue out and stealing his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects . At this point, the film becomes so ridiculously stupid, I prayed that it was over. There was still an hour to go. It looked like half an hour's "Tales From the Crypt" episode somehow stretched to one and a half crap feast. From Tiny Lister, his best John Coffey (The Green Mile) imitates Tracy Scoggins, who plays the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet, fails this movie at every possible level. I gave this 2 stars for just two reasons. 1) His fianc√© is pretty hot, she relieved the pain a bit towards the end and 2) The movie actually looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror movies made with wal-mart quality cameras. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, avoid this turd, even if you have the Blockbuster movie (as I do and I still felt cheated). As a bonus drink game, you and your friends take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will be full for 15 minutes in the movie.
