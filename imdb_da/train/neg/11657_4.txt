"Scary Movie 2" is a failed Scary Movie Franchise. Scary movies 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this one was a bit boring and not very fun. Fortunately, they chose their action after this and made two new amazing Scary Movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a group of teenagers being fooled by their professor to go to a haunted mansion for an evening. Things start to go wrong, and then they realize they should escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not horrible, but they could have improved a few things. It's a little fun, and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give it a watch - but I don't think you will like it almost as much.
