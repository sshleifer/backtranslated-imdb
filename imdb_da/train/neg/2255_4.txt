Was this movie stupid? Yup. Did this film depth? Nix. Character development? Nix. Plot twists? Nix. This was simply a movie about a highly-fictional Springer show. It shows the lengths some people will go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a good job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS! This flick was not so much made to be a "breakthrough" movie, but it was rather meant to live in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like that in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone Otherwise, all the girls will be pregnant by different guys, and all the guys run out the '66 Ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention "trailer park"). Some people over-film movies (case-in-points: Star Trek freaks). I see movies exclusively on the entertainment value; not to point out that the girl is wearing another shirt in another scene (read "Goofs" a little bit about Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better? Of course. But it was fun as hell.
