There is enough star force in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite debatable. The movie and its messages are very noble, and I think most would agree with them. (Liberal Democracy good, violent fascist regime bad; openness good, racism bad, etc.). Unfortunately we are smashed from head to toe with these, and so much subtlety is used as I have described them. <br /> <br /> In the end, we're back to seeing very noble people with no difficulty squaring with unpleasant cretins that have no redeeming qualities. It exudes with all the excitement of a poorly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays patron, a man with many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close as his sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the movie tends to move and it is very fun. Unfortunately, HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture as shooting gallery targets. We don't get to know them, so we can't take care of them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and the screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snapped a few characters, this movie could have worked completely. As it stands, it was a good attempt, with good messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
