If there is a hell of it, it contains a shielding room where GRAND CANYON plays over and over on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help make up Mary McDonnell's performance (whose punishment is to see her own films for eternity) . . But no. Apparently, they injected the other actors with a serum made by McDonnell. The whole affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know someone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil on the ridiculous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of unpleasant, independent people, but never gives us a reason to suffer / understand / sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, the insufficient losers are that the gene pool would be better without. There is no plot to talk about, no sign development (these people never evolve), no break-out performance and the most archery you will ever encounter in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Its title. This is a big hole in a movie.
