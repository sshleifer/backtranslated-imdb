First of all, let me say that I am LDS or rather, I am a Mormon. So when I saw this movie, I gave it automatically for the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I see. And this was no exception. It has its redeeming moments. But they are few and far between. One of the first things I noticed that bothered me a lot was that Halestorm was ashamed of our church! In the LDS church, congregations are called "departments" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". NEVER any of these two names are mentioned. The church is never called by name and the "standards" are as far as it can be mentioned what our church believes. <br /> <br /> Does it make me wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This movie had so much potential! It could really have shown our church in a positive light and helped the public not only see what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired. If I wasn't already LDS, I'd be thinking Mormons are stupid, idiotic, and ashamed of their faith. It's NOT a movie I would recommend to my nonLDS friends. <br /> <br /> Sorry Halstorm. You can do better than this!
