Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early 90s he also tried his hand on film. But this incredible piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. It also joined the play by the Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who continued to be a football woman, a television presenter, and a programmer. I actually saw this in a (almost empty) theater because I used to be a fan of Koen Wouters, the Clouseau band. I'm so sorry to spend money on it. It looks cheap, it's a horrible story, and it's done badly in every way possible. Some people think it's so bad it's fun. I'm not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money.
