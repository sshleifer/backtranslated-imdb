The film had a good concept, but the performance just didn't live up. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, history-historical, it's "Dirty Harry" that meets "M". A pill has begun to terrorize a city. The main detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. The mayor and police officer, in desperation, secretly head the community to speed things up ... to go to places and do things that police would not be able to put an end to this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> To be fair, this movie really has some great things to offer. <br /> <br /> Besides the concept, I liked the look of the murderers' shadow. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has a spooky sewer. In some of the shots the light jumps out of the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often these scenes provide a creepy, dreamless quality. <br /> <br /> The action was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of the actors who get better with age. <br /> <br /> When you get past it, it goes more or less downhill. <br /> <br /> The movie is paced too quickly. The actual investigation process from both teams feels very hasty as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating. This could have been done in two ways: either make the film longer or cut some of the many subplots. Any of these would have caused the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery. For an example of how bad this is, one of the crucial traces that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this: at some point in his life, the suspect went to a pet store ... that's right ... I is completely serious here. It is as if they went from point A (the first link) to point Z (the suspect) and skipped all "intermediate" steps. <br /> <br /> There are the signs. The only ones I actually liked were two pick pockets that you meet about half way through the movie. Given that they are small characters, I will call it a bad sign. Finally, there is the mob angle. This is the one that gets me the most, because that's why I hosted $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean what a hook! There has been an absolute glut of serial killer fleas in the last 10-15 years. The mobile angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest ... but it didn't. <br /> <br /> I expected gangster methods to be brutal but fun and exciting at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they would even throw in some heist movie elements too. We're talking about criminals. Instead, we get some of the most repulsive protagonists who are committed to celluloid. The detectives are asking witnesses. What does the mob do? They interrogate and kill them. It is not even that these witnesses are really as bad either. I actually found the criminals less inclined than the killer they hunt. <br /> <br /> Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest, I'd say give this a lady. Maybe one day they will reuse the same story page and do it right. I hope so. I hate to see such a good concept wasted.
