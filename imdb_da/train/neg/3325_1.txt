Hate it If you think everyone in the South is stupid, moral bankruptcy, stupid, violent, a religious nut, or a children's master, then this movie can be for you. Everyone is poor and apparently ignorant. At one stage, two older men in a general store speak and mention that he had melted a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man took it clearly as a normal part of life. Very fine. A teenage girl is looking back for her sister, and no one offers to help her - despite a blatant and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathair's character is not only thoroughly obnoxious and slimy, but he turns out to be a religious believer who (typically Hollywood) reflects Christian insanity. A scene in the movie reminds you of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - Bible verse versus of the bad guy. I'm from the Great Northwest, but found this movie offensive because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN etc.
