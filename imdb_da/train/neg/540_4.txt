ALL FOR LOVE (as it says when it was broadcast on the weekend) is a romantic period drama with Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon's army, captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and falls in love with a young girl who visits the prison. There is also a story involving a murder. I will be honest and confess that I was not also taken off the movie, as I am not much of a fan of period drama and the manuscript feels somewhat episodic, but I would say that this is well-acted by everyone involved and it has a good draft containing Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. Expectable costume designs are also excellent <br /> <br /> I would be very surprised if this movie doesn't get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime. Captain Saint Ives is in bed with a prostitute, where a nipple is fully exposed, and there is a scene of French prisoners bathing, which includes full frontal male nudity, not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen. You really have to worry if BBC planners have some clues about what they are doing
