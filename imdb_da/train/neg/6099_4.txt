This was a less than exciting short film I saw between features on Turner Classic Movies recently. While the movie popped out because of its very intense Technicolor, the movie itself was not so moving, and sometimes the plot looked rather cheesy - so it was made for use in the classroom and caught the attention of a wider audience. a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the movie things were repeated - as when the characters spoke to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "Mama", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". Furthermore, a sickly Confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a Confederate a Rebel ..." - almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. It was just sloppy writing. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later "Perry White" on the SUPERMAN TV show) in a beard like President Garfield. Yep - he is under the spell.
