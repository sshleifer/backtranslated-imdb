I have not seen this and are not planning to watch this movie or anyone else that includes Lindsay ...... unless & until "poor little rich girl" corrects her life for a 2 year period starting with her most recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> In fact, I don't know anyone who has gone to see any of Lindsay's latest films. I'd rather imagine that 2007 will be the high-water mark in her film-making career until she cleans up her action. All the recent publicity has only prevented her film-making career if she has further aspirations to make more films <br /> <br /> Until this time, film producers have actively sought out Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now Lindsay will probably go to auditions and actually compete for any role. Her reputation is currently "married" and quite possibly could have a negative impact on ticket sales on ticket sales on any movie she is in. <br /> <br /> Sooo .... now Lindsay has to deal with "don't want". .... will she be able to do this? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno wants Lindsay back on his TV show? <br /> <br /> All the foregoing is just my OPINION. I have no internal information.
