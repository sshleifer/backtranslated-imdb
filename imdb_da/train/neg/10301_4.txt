It is a peculiarity that a story that is located in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of local residents are from Asian backgrounds, DO NOT SHOW AN AFSK OR AFRICAN person, not even as an extra. This fact probably describes Norwegian racial relations in general. - But. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY A SHORT INTRODUCTION: Buddy depicts four young people living in an apartment in Oslo. The protagonist is two young men who fail to correct their lives in any serious way, and one can say that the film can be about indecisive and avoid responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The story plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models. Completely clich√©. Although history is mildly fun, the play is good, and as a "young person" one can identify with the characters "crazy" situations and complicated love relationships, I do not find the story or the characters very credible. To polished and lacking in depth. This movie uses all the classic audiences pleasant tricks to make an entertaining movie that has as much intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes it shows on television). Has Norwegian film finally found its identity? pleasers in well-known American style. <br /> <br /> What about Lukas Moodysson's Together (Together).
