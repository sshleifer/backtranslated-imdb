Wow, I'm a huge Henry VIII / Tudor era fan and well, it was .... interesting. The only one I looked at was Catherine of Aragon one. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad actions before, but it reached new heights. When the actor who played Catherine was umm .. crying? she wails and screams and I have to admit I washed many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny things. The only person who even showed a little bit of talent was the actress who played Anne Boleyn (I may be injured even though I have a little obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was a really fascinating woman, read on her, it's worth it! ) I also read a lot about the Tudor period, and I think the characters were not very accurate, they were all very stereotypical. Just watch this movie if you are ready to see a very important time period and the important lives of those involved have become a laugh.
