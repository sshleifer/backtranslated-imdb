So far after week 2 of "The Beauty of Beauty" I am a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are good as long as we except drama. <br /> <br /> I am unsure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is "actually" covering the "Thatcher" years - it's okay as a drama, but I feel the award-winning book is still very much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow-up and the next part of the drama and the years that come with "Things Can Only Get Better" finishing with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with the promise of a government full of sleaze.
