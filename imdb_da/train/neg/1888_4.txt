This film reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", another art film with a violent and radical approach to human nature. I didn't like the movie, but I can't say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also remind you of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where a bunch of low-class people are residents of a camp by the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side with their will and with the whole confrontation of characters that do not fit together. I also thought of the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was an author of the style that is naturalism. I didn't like the movie, and I also don't like the people in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One can ask the question why they live, they all seem to be on this planet a member of a great farce who is forced to live against their will. Or you could say hell is in this world.
