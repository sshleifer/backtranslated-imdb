"Private Practice" is spun by the rather successful and well-written "Grey's Anatomy". Cast is fabulous. The principle can even work. But the writing is just awful. The foreplay disguised as a Gray Anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The reason was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I put the DVR to bind the pilot and all other episodes. <br /> <br /> When I saw the pilot, I just wondered how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot has to suck people in and keep them back for more. There must be excitement, flash, good writing, exciting history with a cliffhanger to be answered for the rest of the season. It was amazing that this show had none of it. <br /> <br /> Thought it was a fluke, I just saw the second episode and hoped for the best. And even though it is marginally better, it doesn't come close to what needs to be interesting, not to miss TV. <br /> <br /> I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. Not worth the IMO and I would very surprised if this show even does it through the middle of the season. Pass this one up people.
