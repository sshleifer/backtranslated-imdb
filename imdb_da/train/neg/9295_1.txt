I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. Nice movies and beautiful landscapes can only take the film so far. I was hoping for a recovery of Hero, but it is much, much worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. No credible characters (even within the well-known movie of Kung Fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot and ridiculous stories. This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. Every time you think your stupid fight makes sense, they discover another ridiculous twist that doesn't make sense. "Ah ha, you just think you've got me with your superpowers and 10,000 jet guns, but I ate my vitamins twisted with plutonium and teflon so your radiators don't work and I'm harmless to your superpowers .... don't press on any trade back endlessly PLUS one. ") Kids can continue with this lunacy because they don't really care about anyone listening because they have a fun time. But for VIEWER, especially the adult adult, this long movie is worse than a bad gas fight. SPOILERS AHEAD Note for kung fu film makers, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back, who has a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a false prop, (c) when you are stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient China where there is no Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) Kung Fu matches do not last for hours, while 3 feet of snowfall, and (e) sometimes it is worth explaining your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should see Hero again, for at least in his own little world it is understandable.
