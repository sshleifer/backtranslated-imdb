There is a word for this kind of movie, and that word is "drivel". It was bad as it was a VHS rental, and it's drops on satellite again. It can fool you because it has 2 moderately known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music, and lovely Monument Valley scenery. It also has some curly, hairy woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want from a movie, it might keep you happy. <br /> <br /> It's still drifting.
