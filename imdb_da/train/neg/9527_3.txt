I've tried to track this movie just by google bad phrases about "teens seduce and kill man in his house" and so. I think I first saw parts of this movie when I was about 10 years old when it was running on cable. It made a good impression! It's the kind of movie that kids know they shouldn't watch, and change channels when their parents come in. When I saw who was thrown, I couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. Then again, if you like to see men cheating on their wives being murdered, then it's an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some very interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the stupid end of all the time, but still ... memorable.
