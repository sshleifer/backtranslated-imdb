What the hell is in your mind? This movie sugar! Every minute I became more and more bored. I was striving to look at the end because I hope something will at least finally happen! But instead of that, I was surprised at how boring the end was being treated ... What is this story of this bloody "bogeyman"? How does he not die? He is a bloody man for God's sake! A clean boy who killed his silly sister 15 years ago. So what ? His stay at a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This movie is a fascinating silly ... It's a must of stupidity. I want to resell it right now for a stupid guy who wants to understand this stupid movie.
