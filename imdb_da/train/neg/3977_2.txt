Identical twin sister Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed to fame in sitcoms like "Two of a Kind", I had never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) in Rome are a Summer Intern program, but not long after they have started their jobs, they are immediately fired for a number of accidents. But the man who owns the company they work in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their jobs, and they slowly use them for useful assets and talented (fashion) artists and help stop a man who takes over the company. Also starts with Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell that this movie was made to go straight to video, the camera work is totally inconsistent, and it doesn't help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to see, the twins are two of the most annoying celebrities around, I knew before they saw that they would not interest me in any way (their not even the beautiful), this is awful host of garbage games. Very poor!
