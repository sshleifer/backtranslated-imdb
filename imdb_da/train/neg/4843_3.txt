Now I had also heard all the breathless reviews and comments on how this movie might deserve the best picture Oscar, so I went to see it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you learn from members of the US military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events in this movie are. They reflected my own thoughts; when the movie I played - a complete civil - kept thinking of myself, "WHAT?" There is no way that would happen. " 2) There is very little that actually happens in the form of plot. A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one that was killed (a death that is not really clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT IS IT! 3) This film is not nearly as exciting as it is claimed. If you want excitement, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try hiring Go Tell the Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket, find that it was a movie he was incredibly proud of and one he regarded as one of his finest work, and which he was still sad, had largely been ignored in the wake of the over-hyped apocalypse now), or an old black and white classic Zinc The Bismark, as in Especially for an English movie, is incredibly heartbreaking. Don't waste your time at Hurt Locker.
