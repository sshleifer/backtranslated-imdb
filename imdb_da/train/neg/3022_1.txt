I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the previews. Normally I see an example of this well, and I buy the movie directly. Something told me that ... you know, see it first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley destroyed all future movies for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey, and I hated her more for that. I think it was to do with her hair and to cut it short for Domino. <br /> <br /> Who is Domino? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't really know or care. I don't know who she was in reality or who she was in this movie. I didn't care about her character, and even Keira became biased, not worth the film. The direction was clearly lacking. The writing was thin and low. The editing was horrible. I don't mind the style as much as the bad use of it. There is room for it. Good examples of crooked, MTV style, colorful editing (not sure if there is an official name) would be Fight Club; right at the top of my head. Even the Enemy of the State had a semi-like editing style on parts. It was tastefully used and was not used as a crutch. I think this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who liked this movie. I guess the idea that you either totally love this movie or totally hate it is a fair rating. Frankly, I hate it.
