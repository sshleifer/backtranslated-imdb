This movie has a redemption function. At one point after a character is attacked by an ax-like adventure, his brother asks him, "Why is your cock over there, Chuck?" Having gone through almost an hour of bad film, it has almost made my drink come out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are not that bad, but the kids all stink and PJ Soles has to be ashamed of himself for making this movie. The story is weak and no one does what you think (or what reason dictates) they should. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many history points that don't fill up. For example, in a scene, ghosts of young children should concentrate on moving a physical object so that they can prove that they exist, a difficult task, as they apparently cannot interact with physical matter. But minutes later, they pick up all the branches of the earth and beat the foot with them. Apparently they can sometimes move, and sometimes they can't. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and gut, though ... a few fine breasts. But it doesn't matter to the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, though many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it puts a mood.
