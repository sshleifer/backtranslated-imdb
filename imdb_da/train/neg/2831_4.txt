I saw it recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine thinks, even though it's not much policeman. The UK's greatest actor is not so interested in this role, which is a shame as he may have increased it with more conviction in his game. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps surprising, as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting, and again his character is not well scripted. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is so beautiful a woman I have ever seen, but gets a little to do, the movie may have gotten a lot by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically playing comics completely outside the film's serious tone. The music is poor, and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless comos (his career has been based on this for decades now). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer must be blamed for not managing this more effectively, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable movie director, and this is one of his weaker films.
