This had a huge caste with big name stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch of smaller but well-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few films made with it in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now, the bad news ... unfortunately, I can't say very positively to the story. It portrayed James boys in a very positive light .... and Hollywood has been doing it ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the "good guys" is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - to evil people. The latter was exaggerated so much that it was prevented. Well, that's the movie world for you: evil is good; Good is bad. Hey Hollywood: Here's a news flash - James boys were criminals! Really - look it up!
