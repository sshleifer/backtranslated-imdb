Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is complete and completely rude, raw, crass and lukewarm. This is actually the only way to describe this horrible, eerie piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes for shock value rather than laughing to try and win his next over. He manages to be fun occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with indecent language and unpleasant sex jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie's foul style. I don't think I will bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I prefer Eddie a lot in the context of a movie script. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
