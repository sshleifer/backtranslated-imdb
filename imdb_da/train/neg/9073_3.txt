This movie looked promising, but actually it was pretty bad. The principle was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the average excitement of this sticky college movie. Jason Schwartzman was once again very annoying - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the casting was quite unrelenting. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be offensive and incredibly young. Trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but not failing at all levels. A total waste of time.
