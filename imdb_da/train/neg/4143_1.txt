Like myself and my other half are big fans of the rubbish bin, we couldn't resist getting out of a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled with! But for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of Freddy Vs Jason, this is a disgrace! The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's worth looking for if you're able to sit through it! <br /> <br /> The action is horrible effects ... well I could do better on my camcorder in reality it is so bad that they only bother to make makeup on the zombies and discharge the neck, hands, etc. No storyline, strange flashbacks that don't make sense and terrible script! "You broke my tooth!" From a vampire "you broke my cigar" was the answer from the man who looked like Uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa!
