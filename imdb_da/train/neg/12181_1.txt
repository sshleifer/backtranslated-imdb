Unfortunately, there was no 0 for a review otherwise I would have chosen it. This movie lacks the starry power of the original film in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn, and expert directly from spicy pro John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) are what made this movie so charming. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this apologized excuse for a sequel. Before making this film, all Ashley Johnson was known for her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the primary time horizon, Growth. She had a few in movies, but I don't know who thought she had enough talent to wear a movie alone. And add Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They couldn't get enough players to play the big roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign Joan Collins to play a British lady? It doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics were entitled not to have agreed with this film, even though it was only made for television, it was a bad sequel to an otherwise lovable movie.
