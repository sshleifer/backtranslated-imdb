There is nothing quite like watching giant robots fighting over a desert destruction and Robot Wars delivering. Sure, the play is miserable, the dialogue is underpair, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has gigantic robots! The particular effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses thumbnails so it has been quite well aged. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked considering the movie's short runtime, and it has some heavy-in-kind humor in parts that make it quite fun. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi looking for a brisk hour of distraction.
