Seems that the cast should secure at least one average movie. And then I sat for 102 minutes with disbelief. Next to Ed Harris, nobody seems to be able to act. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually worship, must have had an off-day throughout the movie of Just Case. Not once during the whole movie could an actor convince me. <br /> <br /> This made this movie look cheap and unreal. The story is a little. It's exciting and the plot is unexpected. The conclusion only see this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.
