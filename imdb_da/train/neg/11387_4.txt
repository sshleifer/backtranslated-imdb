Medellin is a great place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I've never heard anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking hostages or anything like that. There is "invisible police" but it is not * a Big Brother system. There is just enough police, so they are visible in everyday life, but they do not need anyone for good reasons. La Sierra is an interesting documentary film, as the young people it portrays in the film are essentially its characters. The film instructors carefully elaborate plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a "sign" dies, there are genuine pathos. However, it is difficult to imagine that the three young are all members of the Bloque Metro, a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not a precise portrayal of life in Colombia; There are, of course, things to be cautious about as small crime, but when you consider pickpocketing in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia seems no different. Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show the world that the once-war-torn country is now thriving more than ever.
