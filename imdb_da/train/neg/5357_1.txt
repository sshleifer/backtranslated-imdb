I don't know where to start. This movie feels very much like one of the cheap Saturday morning children shows that they used to do back in the late eighties of the early 1990s. Some sort of Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding "secret agencies" and villains. <br /> <br /> The play is so bad that it's not even fun. The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. It looks as if someone just threw a lot of scenes together and forgot that there should be a plot. Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early when several villains plant an explosive device in an agent's car. For some reason, the evil ones decide that even though the device is clearly declared "detonated", they choose to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. This hunt continues. All the time the evil guys are making ridiculous and totally pointless bike points. Stand up on the bikes, do wheelies and so on. At some point, a crash occurs, and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agent's car, but the rider has disappeared. So a few seconds later, the rider and the bike come back ... apparently unscathed by the crash. At this point, although the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent as they pass by, blowing her car. It was also clearly done with cgi. Sound confusing? It is, and it is also the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I might point out that when I say cgi, we're not talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here. We are talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type cgi, in fact I think it would have been better at Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd made this movie, I will never know I can only assume they made for money, as a service for someone, or because they were harassed into it ... probably the last one.
