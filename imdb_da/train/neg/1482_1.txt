MAKE A 0 THINGS OF THE URBAN STEPS! Well, when I started to see this cruise, it was a Sunday afternoon, and I was just looking for things at show time. I was introduced to a hot naked treasure, and like any guy (I'm a guy, the email is my sisters ...) I was happy. But then they threw it all into the dogs, spat on it, lit it in fire and peed it out. Want to know how? DUMB CHICK TALKED! The dialogue throughout the film was just awful. sounded like something my 2nd class bridge could wright. Violence was good for some scenes, but some were just moronic. The scene in the pit was he gives the guy the knife ... stupid moron! To sum up, pure cinema barf is soaked in chocolate syrup known as nudity and topped with cherries of horrible action that only one porn star could deliver.
