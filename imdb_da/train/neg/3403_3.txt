This movie should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it turned on, had illegal signs and had no audience. <br /> <br /> Some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched in the space of a robot friend of theirs (named, appropriately, Jinx). The room scenes are so long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or scary depending on your point of view. Adults will get bored and cheeses out, the kids can be scared when it was filmed, it really leaves a scary feeling. <br /> <br /> There is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle it never takes off. Why it's included in the first place is unclear, except perhaps adding extra tensions between the characters - but failed if that was the idea. <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson should be quirky and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the Future" is amazing. But no, she was annoying and transparent. Not a person you want to date has as a friend or even consider as a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really fortunate that he ever appeared in films again this achievement. Maybe he can act as Mikey in the Life Cereal commercials, but he doesn't know how to be a normal boy. He doesn't fit on the screen, and I don't think we can identify with him at home. I would actually have been happier if he had never returned to earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
