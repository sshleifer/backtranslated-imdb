Assuming this doesn't end up with a straight-to-video release, I would say canceling that title at all costs. Unless you're bored with good, well-known movies, then it is. I saw last night in AFI Dallas and I left with 20 minutes back, simply because I don't care more (about the plot, not to offend the director ... it's awkward). When you can only see a goof for 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, broken window before any shot gets fired ... and then the window goes with the first shot), it goes bad. Let's just say that this is only an indicator of things coming ... unfortunately. I will save you all the details, but it's underpair in every way, even the half-scale act of Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect half-assed action from him. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in the rape scene. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
