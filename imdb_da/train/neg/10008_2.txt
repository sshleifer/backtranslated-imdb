The movie is bad. There is no other way to say it. History is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a "walker" is or really want to worry about. I felt I saw a movie from the 70's. The subject just wasn't credible for the year 2007, even though it was set in DC. I think this was right for everyone else who also looked at it when the applause was low and fast at the end. Most did not remain for Q&A. <br /> <br /> I don't think Schrader really believed in the movie at the moment. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut like they had never finished, or he just didn't know how to finish them. He ran from one scene to the next, and you had to try to figure out or guess what was going on. Nor did I get Woody's (Carter) privacy or boyfriend. What were all the "artistic" male bondage and torture images (from Iraqi prisons) about? What did he think? I think it was his very bad attempt to try to create this dark private subculture for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even seem obvious. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (car) flawlessly. You really got a great sense of what a "walker" could have been like (say twenty years ago). He was great and probably will never be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Drilling. <br /> <br /> Don't see it! It's painful! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.
