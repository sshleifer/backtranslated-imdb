Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst play ever. No really worst play ever. David Hess (last house on the left ?? No, from the seventies. Rent what it is really good) is the worst of the pile (Exactly tough competition, but he is incredibly god-horrible.) You would be hard pressed to find a home video participates with such an awkward camera presence. The movie actually screams to an amazing painful stop when he's on the screen. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to destroy. It is filmed with a home theater camera and by the look of things a beautiful old one complete with attached boom mike. No post production either. Come on, there must be something shovelware a five-year computer could use that could clean up this image. Throw bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy and carrier carrier takeoffs and this is a visually screwed image. The autopsy images are interjected as Italian cannibal films, interpreting these god-fearing real life killings. And the fleet's recordings are supposed to be some anti-war declaration (because we know that all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the fleet) What in the world is Lion's Gate by releasing this garbage? It would bother Troma. The reason is about the Zodiac Killer (last seen in Dirty Harry ??. No, from the 70's. Rent it is really good) Someone gets shot in the stomach in LA, and the police believe the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer elderly man looks like a congressional and closeted congressman? Some of the haircuts and production values ​​meet a Nambla subplot. Sign me up.
