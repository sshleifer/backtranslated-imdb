Apart from the great filmography of the amazing James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this movie is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie I've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". It was so miserable that I shut it down. This one I fear is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for 1937 standards, but when you compare it to a Helen Mirren, it's absolutely no fight. Robson is called Robson's lines. Her fight message to the English troops is so lacking in spirit. Even a trembling Laurence Olivier cannot save this incredible piece of boredom. Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she does not really transfer anything here. To believe that Scarlett was 2 years later! It's a shame that the history of the Spanish Armada is made to be so boring in this movie.
