OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, resting in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was "The Crocodile Hunter" TV show with bad actors, bad scripts and bad instruction between Steve who catches or teaches us animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The reason was so broken, it was almost non-existent. Casting was terrible. The actor was not even worth acting at the elementary school level. The direction must also be interrupted. If you can't get half a decent performance out of your actors, no matter how bad the script is, don't be so good at first. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been watching this movie. Of course I saw it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son.) While you're out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie in order, but he has never asked to see it again. If you want good memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I wouldn't be remembered for this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie!
