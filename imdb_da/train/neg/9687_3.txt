This is an enchanting movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is degraded by a set of men and women that can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits. <br /> <br /> Greenaway recognizes his inspiration for Fellini's movie "8 1/2", but while Fellini is a titanium of world cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> He has none of the maestro's lightness or his ability to convey emotions and emotions with clarity. <br /> <br /> He is pretentious, as the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer should be steered into the movie, except that the written messages remain only on the screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for the women, only two can be described as lookers, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest oozes with ordinariness. Both the women and the men withdraw from the hard light of reality into the obscure nuances of imagination. <br /> <br /> Of course, Greenaway will point out that sexual fantasy does not bring happiness. The women themselves are depressing as they make their services in exchange for money. The relationship between men and women is interrupted in a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the movie. In fact, there are several scenes that are deeply uncomfortable: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental, respectively, played by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The annoying disrespect for both men, as Giaconda carries their child, is actually pregnant twice, the first fetus being interrupted, and for the second time she is sent to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book. Both men have sex with a woman who does not have bones (half the woman in the title). The beastiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortense. Father and son share women between them. Women enjoy being sexually beaten. Father sleeping with his dead cross play. <br /> <br /> None of these scenes have been shown sexually, but only suggested. <br /> <br /> The suggested breakdown of women is such that it was no wonder the movie was booed when it first premiered in Cannes. What is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film have to defend it and once again show that there is no limit to women's naivety and that women will be fooled into being exploited by men. <br /> <br /> Greenway's directional style is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over matter, a depiction of Film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. Greenaway tries to achieve the sublimity of surrealism, but only manages to show the banality of human relationships.
