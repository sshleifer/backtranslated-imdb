Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than "Envy". Whenever characters continue to repeat what you've already seen and were not fun the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which "envy" is certainly. A movie that relies on a joke had better have a place to go with it. Here we have a movie that goes completely nowhere. Christopher Walken wants to forget about this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some very good black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex", comes to mind immediately. Make sure "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just total nonsense. "Envy" deserves it's low rating because it's the subject of what it stinks. - NOTE
