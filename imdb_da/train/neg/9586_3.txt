After the disastrous Revolution, this film was basically the last stitch in Goldcrest's coffin and thus the British film industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from the mid-80s jazz festival and based on a book and writer that was short popular at the time and deservedly sank back to ambiguity. The temple was looking for age to try to find Suzette and came up with 8th wonder Patsy Kensett another person who was short popular at that time. When the film came out of the post production, the Jazz revival was over, just as Kenset's career and the film met a completely eerie film audience. Mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst / campestic / cheesiest plays to always grace the British silver screen watching it nearly 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy.
