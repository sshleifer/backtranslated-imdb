This is simply set, the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from as 2+ hours, and boxing art was completely misleading. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be a poor man 300. You know, laugh and make fun. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then the movie starts and they speak some other language. We believe, "Oh, it's just the beginning." But no, from there, the film blows and becomes more like a super boring book that you could read in the classroom where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes compete with the two children who are struggling in a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this movie belongs to the trash. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
