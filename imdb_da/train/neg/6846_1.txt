I'm a big fan of karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I saw this movie after I saw Fiza, which was absolutley brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad and there are movies that are cr * p but this movie just takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> We were so annoyed that we were spoiled by paying our money expecting a decent movie. Avoid at all costs, not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
