This is seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another movie by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I really liked this movie - asano is a great actor and the great movie was incredibly appealing. but I couldn't find anything entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> The movie takes forever to do nothing. and the effects that the director used - like the constant percussion and the unmanned use of slow motion - only added my growing irritation to the fact that the plot was so very slow, and the actors became extremely overactive. a lot of boredom was the result of alien additions that were completely unnecessary - as an hour spent on asano, which went around cutting buddha statues and preaching how he did not worship anything. this added nothing to the plot. a fellow japanese movie buff and i checked both times all the time. We couldn't believe this movie was as horrible as it was. and the final was horrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for being able to sit through this, but unfortunately I was wrong.
