Sergio Leone spins in his grave ... If there were any movies trampled on a man's life, it works here. The main character's "lone wolf" bravado is uninspiring and lamb, and the manuscript was apparently written by a monkey with an eight-grade education. The one who is the idea of ​​this was should be horse whipped. The only reason I spend time on waste is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family must sue, not because its shit, but because it is now immortalized as a crap by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does crap that won't offend anyone other than cocaine users and weapons experts ... this movie is pure blasphemy.
