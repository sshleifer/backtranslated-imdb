A group of us saw this movie is was really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite person Jo was not (it's not like the authors / producers could do anything about it). The script was poor, the script was underpaired. What really annoyed us: 1. When the two guys realized that they were both dating Natalie, they not only left the stupid (and ultimately degrading) competition - but only because they were macho-competing guys, not because they really were wanted Natalie. 2. Although Natalie suddenly can't choose between the two guys before reunification, she decides that she really loves one of the boys and is ready to marry him? (And there was no shadow that he was really a better guy, it was as if the authors were turning a coin and then just had her spit it out in a good spot in the movie). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she doesn't want children and then suddenly when her husband says he wants children, she happily agrees with him.
