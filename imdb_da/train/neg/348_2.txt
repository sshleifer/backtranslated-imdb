This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw, Fishburne and the normally solid Ed Harris. Connery works miscast as a Harvard Academic. The movie gets worse as it goes on. It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely enchanted by the time it unravels. The film erases an excellent support molding. George Plimpton also appears in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere pepper a third set of mystery / thriller that is highly manipulated. The scriptures and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence is the film's only virtue. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid it.
