Damn, I thought I had seen some bad westerns. Can't top this one yourself. Hell, I think I'd rather have my eyes open to a Trinity Triple Feature for cryin loud. I don't think I can see Ben Hur again without laughing my ass out. Just really bad. <br /> <br /> But hi, if you like stupid westerners with acclaimed stars in the matter, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much more fun. 1.10
