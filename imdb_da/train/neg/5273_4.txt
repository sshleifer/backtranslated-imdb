*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw an example of this movie, I thought it was at least a little admirable story. But like most superstation original movies I was left disapointed. This happy family ends up driving through this "deserted city" to take a brake and find this camcorder that shows that these people are doing everything they do and find that they all disappear eventually, the family goes through all these mysterious phases and never discover or show what the heel stalks them. There are more gaps than I can count, and they do not explain anything that happens, how or what. It ends where the family comes in a car accident and becomes posh or brainwashed or something (never explained). The next thing you know is that you somehow hope to find out how it all happened, but it stops leaving you completely confused.
