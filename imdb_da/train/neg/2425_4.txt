### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is this movie offer? Uncontrolled editing and filmography that correspond to a horrible plot. It is sad to see that Denzel Washington's talents are wasted in waste like this. We are certainly suggested how the Mexicans cannot save themselves, beyond the forces necessary, possibly militaristic, American. And we know that the father is a shady character, he is a Mexican, unlike wife who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed all of them when she died. And did she? Of course she does not want to be a young child, and you should not hurt Hollywood fans' sensibilities. The thesis scene was the only thing that prevented me from classifying it under the "incredibly successful" (as a critic pointed out) 'taken'. The nausea of ​​such films will take time to go. It is in the assessment of such films that we have to doubt IMDb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure! Mine is in the range of 3.5-4.0
