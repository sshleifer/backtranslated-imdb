This movie was terrible to say the least. I hoped much better after seeing "High School Musical". The whole movie was a complete rip off of "The Simple Life", only that wasn't a reality show. <br /> <br /> The action was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was not so horrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was bad throughout. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, played a French guy, but had a terrible accent. A good thing about this movie was the very sweet Michael Trevino who played Alyson's love interest. Just something to keep in mind if this movie had been sent before "High School Musical" would probably not have been so bad. But there was no comparison. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give it a 2.
