Note that I have given this 1 star if the opportunity was given. I would have given this zero. When I put this DVD in my TV and sat on my sofa, I expected some of the worst movie shows at its best. I watched this movie on IMDb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so I guess I got into it critically for any mistake. But it didn't prepare me for the shit that was about to spit from my TV screen. The box makes this movie look good at best. Don't let yourself be disappointed. This film must be banned from all shelves worldwide. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe this movie is like porn, but without any sex scenes in it. The actor (if you can call it that), "plotted" (so many holes should look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects are really just awful. <br /> <br /> Don't be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not say that I can make a better movie than this, but I think about it.
