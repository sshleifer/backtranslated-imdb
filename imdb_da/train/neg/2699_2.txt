I have not read a single IMDb commentary on this film, which mentions how the Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun pointed to his face by a racist skinhead while the movie's lead-like character looked sternness into a gun barrel. <br /> <br /> I don't know how anyone could experience this as a balanced statement on university life. I agree universities are not bastions of tolerance as they should be, and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make his characters such caricatures. On the surface he tries to portray the Ice Cubes character as a bad guy who provokes Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who finishes at the end of the film's redeeming epilogue? It appears Singleton points on white as either unable to empathize (I did not sympathize!) With his colleague's black pupil OR only able to take the road to a racist skinhead. Many people who have been bullied by people in another race do not turn to extreme bigotry. <br /> <br /> Neither women who have been raped turn to lesbianism, depicted more as a cult than a lifestyle. Frankly, what was the purpose?
