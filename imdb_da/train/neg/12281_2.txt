Hear such praise about this game, I decided to watch it when I stumbled across it on cable. I can't see how this "elives" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject at hand. I guess if you're interested in stories about women's private parts and how it affects their lives, then that's for you. Otherwise, it's pretty boring and boring. If anything, I found it a bit degrading. <br /> <br /> I asked with a female friend who also looked at this and she thought it was terrible. So it's not just a guy "not getting it".
