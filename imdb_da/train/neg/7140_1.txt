You already know how painful this movie is. But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever should contain one of the most beautiful cars. Why the cars should not only be victims of offenses, but also the only true actors and artists in it. So how on earth can you Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever allow them to get in touch with your cars and destroy your reputation as you give millions. Stop getting a benefit from the cars and earn money from their coffins. It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
