I grew up seeing the Inspector Gadget. It was and still is one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever. <br /> <br /> But the movie has destroyed the amazing cartoon reputation. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, a potential actor, was definitely not the role of the Inspector Gadget. First in the movie Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the comic. In the film Gadget solves the mystery for most of itself. In the comic, it was almost always Penny, Brain and the amazing book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. The gadget in the movie seems to be a competent detective, but in the comic book it was pretty stupid, which was where humor came from. Another thing is that it's too much "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. It's not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the right gadgets the Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the film it was a beautiful convertible. In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could become a van. It also hardly had any gadgets and was mostly there to get him from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if anything, it was terrible about the movie that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The movie was too serious, too exaggerated, had too much of a plot and was not even externally fun. Tips for those who haven't seen it: Never see it. EVER. See the comic, it's a true classic.
