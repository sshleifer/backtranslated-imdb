This was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in. I understand that this movie was primarily to showcase the new ones that made it good for novices, but everywhere the movie was not credible. <br /> <br /> With all firearms you would think the police would have intervened. Even the coin was a mistake on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the mistake, it wasn't realistic. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie was merging quickly. Poor job. Get a better author. <br /> <br /> The count down to the end was not synchronized with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy was gonna blow Sean, he'd be out of bounds. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's character was the fog. It was so stupid when Sean knocked him out at the end. It was like a comedy. Bath! Bath! Bath!
