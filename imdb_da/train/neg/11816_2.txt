To be lost in the room frozen for 15 years, it is unlikely. Falling into a star ... unlikely. Fall into the day it goes supernova and explodes ... ridiculous. Being saved by a ship right then ... priceless. No, it is not Zaphod Beeblebrox's Heart of Gold for rescue. Nor is it the year's parent company. After convicting her daughter for two years of solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship, her mother urges her to be full and walk alone with the strange man they have retrieved. This foreshadows their skill in the hand to the combat, which constitutes most of the film's action. For example, the battle's highlights include the psycho who speaks close-to-face with a woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him on the other, about six inches away, sensing the fire. <br /> <br /> You stop the family of three the big city ship they planned to use to observe the supernova until the last minute, because it is too slow to escape the blast wave, instead of using the psycho giant ship they have burned in about a minute with a 1600 pound gas drive from a 0.7 kilotone missile. You have to love these tough sci-fi statistics! <br /> <br /> As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they will continue to make movies not fit to run at 3pm on the Sci channel.
