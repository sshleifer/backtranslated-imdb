Note to all crazy scientists everywhere: If you want to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, give him a scary name than "Paul." I don't care if he is a scary hammerhead with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to back people in the water as well as on dry land. Give the child a more worthy name like "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon." Because even if he eats me up, I'll just sit there laughing: "Have a lot of this !!! Paul the Monster rips me to power !!!!!" It's the worst part about this movie is, this shark thing is referred to as "Paul" throughout the girl. It does what might have been a decent, scary horror movie just seems silly. Not that there are no other campy and constructed parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." Scientists use the whole movie to wander along this island, and suddenly one of the girls begins to itch ugly to walk in the lush forest and just pour water on their feet to revive the itch, which of course allows "Paul" to come out the water and kill her. The only SciFI Channel did really in this movie was let hottie live. But it is a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie.
