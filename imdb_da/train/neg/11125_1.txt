Hey look, handle it, there are much better portrayals of severe America's adversity than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor performance of the story I have mentioned, blowing. <br /> <br /> This was made in the mid 80's and is horrible in the music / score section. It's fun to see Oprah as a last-day crack-whore type. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger saw Elizabeth McGovern in the incinerator. Clean classic cinema. First, I don't care how full you are, you will respond to the 1200F degree of flame (no matter how bad your play is). But they really milked that scene ... it was comical. I will tell you, however, I was very pleased to see Elizabeth McGovern burning in a faux death; she annoys me
