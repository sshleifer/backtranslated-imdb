... let me count the way. <br /> <br /> 1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out all the cliches in the slasher handbook. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A complete weakness in all attempts at voltage or voltage. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that ensures no gore, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is not scary or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A casting of characters that is so thinly written and stereotyped that we could not care about them. <br /> <br /> 7. A lack of a creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A script of dialogue that is beyond poverty - it is fun emotionally. <br /> <br /> 9. A variety of cardboard shows (not sure whether the actors or the malicious aforementioned script is due to it). <br /> <br /> 10. A totally scary teen-targeted slasher remake that is not brave enough to try to have a fantasy - or even to show a blood sausage. <br /> <br /> Saving your money is a no-brainer horror fan. <Br /> <br /> BOMB out of ****
