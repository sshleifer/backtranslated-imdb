When the employees at a theater find an old movie reel, they decide to show it at the midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead, assuming that it is an old preview roll. Unfortunately, it is actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the hate for this movie. It is a low budget dependent production with a lot of camp, but it does not deserve a "1.1" here on IMDb. It's just so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have reasonable knowledge and love of old horror films, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and tribute to a number of them. It has the feeling of such things as the living dead night (in many ways, very similar), evil dead 2 and the army of dark and different others. I liked the explanation of how the zombies, although I'm really hypnotized to believe they are zombies, actually come to have the living death-physical characteristics - perhaps, but I appreciate the work of the authors to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget, the play was okay, and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
