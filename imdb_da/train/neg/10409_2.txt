As if the story was not depressing enough, this movie shows cows that are slaughtered graphically in a slaughterhouse in all five minutes, while the protagonist tells his early life as a butcher. Strange things. Then, here's the main priority that goes and cuts his cock because one is busy at work, says he would have been with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? He did not just adopt it and had to live it out with nuns who first loved him and later hated him because he was unjust. He is trying to explain to us the reasons why he did what he did, but it really is so difficult to empathize. Such a sad and unusual self-destruction. Should it be fun? What was it about?
