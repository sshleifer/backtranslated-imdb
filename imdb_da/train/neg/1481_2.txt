Did they spend their entire budget to pay the porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music and editing generally were so bad you would think some 12-year-olds would be made the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were good considering the script ... the "innocent virgin" played his part really well. <br /> <br /> The mutants look really cool and this could actually have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately for everyone involved, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Turn Left was made better than this movie, and the guys didn't even have any money !!! Good thing, I didn't rent the movie myself!
