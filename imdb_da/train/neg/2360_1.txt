This will be the most useless comment I've ever put down, yet I have to do it to warn you about the horror at the cinema that "Freddy's Dead" is. Not only is it the worst chapter of the nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel all the time! It was boring, meaningless and almost death-free. The horrible 3-D end and over-the-top CORNY killer is enough to drive this "movie" into the ground. But it doesn't stop there, just add bad plays, a horrible script and a series of cheesy comos, and you've got yourself this heap of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I also wanted if I went out like that. This is a movie that is only strict fans, not staring at our shame.
