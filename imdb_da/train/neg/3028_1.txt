My flatmate rented this movie the second night so we saw it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive because the whole movie is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast sequences, cool angles, sweeping camera movements - at the moment you feel like you're seeing another "Snatch" at the moment .... When the plot actually begins to unfold, one begins to feel like an overdose of amphetamine. things just don't make sense anymore. I would hate to spoil the fun of seeing it by giving certain scenes, but then again the movie is so bad that you are actually better off not seeing it. First, you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation gives no coherent narrative at all. On the contrary, Dominos lesbians judge Lucy Liu's character in the second part of the movie just throwing the audience into further confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it might be a movie about a girl from wealthy but dysfunctional background that grew to be a hard bounty hunter. In any case, it is the message presented by the opening scenes. But after that, the question of Domino's character is completely lost to the criminal plot. So in short, no this is not a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably a story of a robbery. A beautiful bloody robbery. 10 million went away, bounty hunters hunt for suspect robbers, mafia children carried, hands removed, Domino tries to crack, why this time they do not get bounty certificates etc. But soon this impression is disturbed by another U-turn of plot. <br /> <br /> This time we are faced with a sad story of an overweight African-American woman who falls due with the local MVD and at age 28 is a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars at the Jerry Springer show, trying to publish a new, crazy race theory and at the same time struggling to find money for her infant. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? Okay, nobody knows. Apart from the fact that the director had to explain to the audience, bounty hunters will put their collector price at 300,000. <br /> <br /> At some point, you begin to think, "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distorts things". There is reality TV crew running around with bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. Bounty Hunters is also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors who just whine all the time having their noses broken and even dragging too many crime scenes. But no, this is not a movie about the media, they only appear sporadically in the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other subplots: The crazy Afghan guy is bent on liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the Mescaline episode, the FBI monitoring operation ... <br /> <br /> Can all the above stuff packed in 2 hours of movie? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
