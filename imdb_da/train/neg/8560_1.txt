What time do we live in when someone like this Joe Swan-whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker at all! Where is the new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent ??? We need them bad and hell with mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie is about nothing, just like the characters in the movie stand for nothing. It is this horrible, so-called Gen Y, full of bored idiots, some of whom declare themselves filmmakers without disturbing learning about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a film maker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a film maker. Dreyer was a film maker, etc. Current movies like these show how stupid young, so-called "filmmakers" can be when they think they go out without script, no direction, no thought, no legit "camera work" (everything shot terribly on DV) , no editing tools, nothing, stands for "rebellious" or "advanced" filmmaking. No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation at the cinema (and there's actually a "jack-off shot" in your face), so be clear. <br /> <br /> Look at the early films of any accomplished "indie" movie creator: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog ... no one did anything as boring and meaningless as this However, the Swan - regardless of hell - still needs to go to SXSW every year and be hailed as a kind of gutsy, new talent. It's bad! I can't imagine anyone who likes this and anything else that the so-called filmmaker has done (all of me) is just as bad (the newer things are clearly made to appeal to a more common audience, one of sitcom-called). Clarify unless you are a friend or family member of those involved. On the other hand, if you are a family member or friend, you would probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromise situations. . <br /> <br /> Exfoliate garbage. This is not art. This is the ultimate opposite of it.
