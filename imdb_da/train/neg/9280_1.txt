Honestly, I don't know what is more fun, this horrible remake or the comments on this forum. The masterpiece review had me in tears, it's so much fun. Anyway, this movie is among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for successors. The "Omen" name of the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a blow to the face of the other three, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite is the guy who takes fire from the juggler at the psychic show !! good times ! This movie is for the Omen series, what "Scary Movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh.
