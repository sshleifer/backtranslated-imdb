Despite the rave reviews that this flick has received in New Zealand, any hype surrounding the production is unfortunately undeserved. Apart from a clichés-only plot, the movie is disappointed by some weak actions, accents and general lack of excitement. <br /> <br /> While having the overall look of a large budget (for NZ), one feels that is certainly small town of Kiwi ... Has anyone not seen The Brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who want to choose the similarities immediately .... I heard comments that scenes like boys who played basketball, etc. were shot to poke fun on clichéd "boys speaks crap ", but it comes across as forced ... I think Oscar Keightley sees himself so deeply ironic, but again his delivery always looks only vaguely self-conscious. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that the Samoan-living-in-NZ culture has been deep, hopefully not permanent, influenced by American speech, culture, and everything between them will surely have their thoughts present at the end of this movie. /> <br /> Robbie Magasiva always looks good on the screen, but knocks down the script. <br /> <br /> It always rubs me in the wrong way, when a "comedy" has scenes created in such an obvious way, you are felt to have a good sense of cliché - see that you want be white boy ... I know someone who found this movi e hilarious-though, the person has the brain in a tadpole, and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars .... That kind of sums up the mentality of This flick, OK but not amazing, fun but not fun ..... Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5 star movie after all the glowing (middle class white guilt? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? if you see it, get full first !!!
