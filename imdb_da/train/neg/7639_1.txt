I watched this movie at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. First and most distracting was the way much of it was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly artificial close-ups that seemed to have no meaning - historically wise or aesthetic - other than showing the filmmaker's skills (which I think was also director). This movie thought what a pretentious movie student would come up with. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very sweet, but at best was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the throw ranged from half-year to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I must admit that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the movie; laughing and sugar constantly, but I didn't like it very much.
