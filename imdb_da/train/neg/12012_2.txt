The dialogue was pretty terrible. The reason not really everything that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents. Not visually amazing. In fact, visually annoying at times. Most definitely one of these movies you find easier to quit if you hold a finger on the fast-forward button. If you could see it for free, you have absolutely no other options at the moment, and you are really digging to see the little Poltergeist lady ... well maybe I would recommend it to you, but not anyone else I could think of at the moment.
