I'm not sure how they are related, but I'm almost sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story it's based on). Very similar plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so watch one instead. <br /> <br /> One moves very slowly but is a late 60-French movie that can be expected of the style. Told in a demand from the perspective of one of the girls traveling the school. Editing flashbacks with the current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially since the sound of each overlap (ie hearing of flashbacks while watching the present and vice versa). Also, the "girls" are a little old to think they are in a boarding school. Finally, not much character development to get yourself attached to the movie.
