I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1 <br /> <br /> It's the story is very boring and it has little to do with the original Timecop. Lots of things from Timecop were scraped and they put new stupid things in place. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason timetraveling is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, even most of them is not ... only the first is fantastic ... and there are not many action scenes at all and they are all quite short <br /> <br /> At some point in history, the main characters travel through time around 5 times within a few minutes ... no wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: Don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
