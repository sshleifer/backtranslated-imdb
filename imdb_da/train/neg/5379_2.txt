Published on DVD in the UK as Ax, Choke is a teenager who fails in virtually every department: The story is almost non-existent, resulting in a movie consisting mainly of people wandering around a dark building; except for two characters (which are clearly intended to be the survivor of the movie), all are thoroughly offensive, meaning that the viewer could not fit less when slaughtered; The deaths are not enough (unless a short shot of a pound of minced beef covered in false blood makes your stomach); and the free sex scene is next to no nudity (an unforgettable mistake to make in a slasher flick!). The wafer-thin plot sees members of a punk band locked in what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are picked up by an invisible striker. For a low budget effort, the production values ​​are okay, and the cast seems to be quite good actors, but with almost real real scares, a reluctance to become really messy (it's a slasher, so where is the graphics splatter?), Too much terrible dialogue (especially from the non-dead, soon enough drummer) and some badly recommended use of stuck video techniques in an attempt to add some style quickly becomes very boring.
