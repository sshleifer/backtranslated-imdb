I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and was interested in seeing how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Having seen that, I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it. I feel embarrassed, not just for myself, but for everyone else who had any role in making that mockery in the British "comedy". From the beginning to the end, the film is predictable, dull, dull, monotonous and cringe-worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in disbelief. Until you actually see the movie, it's hard to imagine how un-romantic and un-comedic a romantic comedy can be. It's not just a bad story, but a badly made movie. In a scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing S.A.s when you have to wipe over. I will write details about this in the "Goofs" section. <br /> <br /> On that side it followed me with emotions (disappointment, rage, embarrassment?)
