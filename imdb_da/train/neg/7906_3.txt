Not a blow to Korman when he was a lot of fun at the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks' movie ("High Anxiety" coming to mind). However, he is not a person who can carry a movie in duels roles no less. This is basically a "Gremlin" knockoff that follows a tradition of such films as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It is also not a very good knockoff, on a par with "Ghoulies", but with a much brighter tone to it, as it is not as near as dark as that movie got. In fact, this one is too light and scary, and unfortunately many of the jokes are even flat. Although I gave it a 3 for a score, it is only because there is a movie that is even a worse "Gremlin" knockoff. If you looked at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about ... the infamous "Hobgoblins". This one has a guy to find some critter in some underground locations (I only saw this movie once long ago, so I can't remember too clearly) and it probably starts friendly. However, this creation quickly becomes unfriendly and, of course, there will be more and that is the movie. More misses than hits in the joker department, and it is also very sad to see Korman play the evil brother role. Best to skip this one, but then maybe you can just check it for kicks.
