What made the French connection so good was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this disaster directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the island of Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his outstanding obsession with capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictional idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities, laughs a lot of fun. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier doesn't jump over the city with 65 pounds purely smack !!! A street value of 32 million, but yes, let's send Doyle to find this guy, that was his pinch. Please!!! History was weak. The action was horrible (with the only exception from Hackman, who completely overplayed his part). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and see the first installment twice and skip this one.
