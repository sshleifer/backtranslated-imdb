bad acting, bad southern accents, inconsistent filmography, terrible script ... I was looking forward to this movie at a recent film festival and was so discouraged after seeing it. It contains quote / unquote name talent, but they do not deliver. Of course, the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story being told. <br /> <br /> Don't bother
