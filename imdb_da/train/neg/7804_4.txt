TEMP (1993) did not do much theater business, but here's the direct-to-video rip-off you didn't want anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a large-scale brokerage firm that is starting to receive good advice from the broad-eyed secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious father's girl who will stop by nothing to climb the ladder of the company, including screwing a broker, she can't stand and murder anyone coming on her bad side. She digs skeletons in Ellens closet, tries to cause trouble with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while she looks responsible, kidnaps her daughter, and tries to get her to cushion money from the business. <br /> <Harris and Kelley provide competent performances, the support casting is okay, and it's reasonably well-structured, but it doesn't fully compensate for a script moving down a well-worn path and giving few surprises.
