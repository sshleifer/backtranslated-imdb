I should have listened. I was warned, and yet I paid money for this, after reading all the reviews, having knowledge of the original is "so bad it is good" and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all, even then could Do not resist. Exactly what happened here? The first part was Hilarious, it had so much political inaccuracy, and others Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this one who just couldn't be a worse sequel to God's green earth, not Basket Case 2, hell, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst sequel in history, and it really says something that ponders the groundbreaking bottom of the barrel quality of the original. Criminal insane part 2 was just another brand of bad. Shot on Video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of all the crazy, cool Ethel has lost part of her circumference. I mean honestly, is it a kind of sick joke?!? Thank you, Nick Milliard. 1.1
