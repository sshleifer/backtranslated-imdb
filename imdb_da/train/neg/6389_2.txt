I waited nearly 25 years to watch this movie and thought it could be an underestimated work. From a period, the animation was no longer the quality it had once been. It was one of the best movie chants from all the time, based on a beloved series of children's books and was a Disney Studios production. What could be wrong with that? As it looks, almost everything. Well, not everything. Vincent Price like Rattigan and Henry Mancini's swanky score is the movie's two saving graces. The price is enjoyable and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring the class to a project that otherwise belongs to ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, while the rest of the movie is full of inappropriate adult situations, it still suffers from a completely boring script, mixed generic voice work, horrible songs and lazy animation that wouldn't be out of Place at any of Disney's mid-1980s Saturday morning TV shows. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment to me. It's amazing that this movie was almost modern with The Secret of NIMH. An independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD has in its endless running time. <br /> <br /> The extra star that keeps this from being "terrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
