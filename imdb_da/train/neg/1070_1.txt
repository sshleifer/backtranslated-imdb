I've seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so horrible so I got halfway through and couldn't bear to see the rest. A shame. With talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hung his cats, etc. So, Branagh sent him to a nuthouse and he escapes immediately. Somehow (I couldn't figure out how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen, and Tom Berenger are all blending into the story, moving slower than stationary. I wanted to like this and being a great Grisham fan has read all about this movie and I (foolishly) expected something interesting. This is honestly the WORST movie I have seen to date, and I wish I could get my money refunded. * out of *****.
