If you want an undemanding and reasonably entertaining hour or so then it's OK to see this. It's not that bad, really. Yes, it's more discharged in logic than I usually describe here and can tax people's patience - which I myself must admit - who is inclined to throw things on the TV at times, but at least it's fun. Just because it's not always fun, it's not necessary to let it get you down. <br /> <br /> But if you've read the book - or any of the other books from Brookmyre - then you'd better avoid it. I've read them all, and when I first looked at this movie, I despised it. In fact, I have wasted it in detail and largely on another site. The TV plot carries virtually no relevance to the book and only serves to quarrel and disturb many faithful (and indeed healthy) Brookmyre fans. <br /> <br /> Best bit of advice ..? See this, then read the book and only make your comparisons and submit your judgment.
