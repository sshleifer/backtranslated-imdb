I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I was watching, I thought, "This is a really bad porn girl without porn." I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has some real problems." So I saw the director / author Carlson explain his process as a special function. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The weight of the film is put on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. They are marginally attractive. There is frontal and full nudity. These factors are probably due to the film being seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most urgent feature of the movie is gay bashing and the subsequent additional gay bashing of the same victim trying ineffectively to claim revenge from his attackers, the two drunk losers. Not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view, but the play is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> There is the boxer-stalker theme. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attention of a carnal mommy's boy working in his gymnasium car park. This is in LA, remember. The boxer is so traumatized that he gets into the stalker's house, strips in front of him and gets excited about the process. Well, all I can say is why would a boxer who is in the heart an exhibitor become so traumatized by a stalker? It simply makes no sense. And I'm afraid some psychodynamics actually make sense if you take the time to read about them. But bad scripts rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have thought that this movie represents a significant minority in homosexuals. Well, he can be right, I suppose. We can never know since that minority would be so dysfunctional that they would hardly be organized enough to ever come to an unclear gay movie festival or DVD store, the only two places they could find this turkey. Thank goodness for that.
