Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts a lot and only worsens. Katherine Heigl is deeply mistaken for a Lolita role, and Leo Grillo fights with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. The only cast member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who is ashamed of it as a villain and goes overboard with his role. The script is scary, the actor is horrible, and it has plunger holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! It's also the sexiest movie I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is completely unsympathetic. She is seen as a vicious, vain seductive who entices the poor, innocent, poisonous man to cheat on his wife. It is implied throughout the film that she is a minor, and the message accompanying this plot string just begs faith! In the end, she is not even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who has, of course, been denied for anger and guilt, but the manuscript allows him to kill himself and thereby release himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Terrible. Do not waste your time.
