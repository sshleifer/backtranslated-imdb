Jane Russell turned out to be a wonderful musical comedy performing in the corresponding titles "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? But unfortunately, this movie obliterates these skills. There is a budget and lovely Paris photograph, but the movie just doesn't work. Mrs. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. It leaves no one to adequately play Jane Russell. Some of the other players are WAY out of their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; most of all, be warned: there is a musical number where African cannibals "boil" the brunettes in a pan after Alan Young sings in a gorilla cover. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
