The interaction between the characters is a moral disaster. You don't end up suffering most of the characters, and you don't like any of them. <br /> <br /> Even the two main characters David and Gwen play are so poorly written that you really don't care about them. The film has no plot, no direction and no purpose. The only redeeming quality in the film was to treat it as an insight into the cold life of a few losers - and it is hardly stimulating even as afternoon waste.
