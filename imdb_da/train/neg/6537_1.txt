First be warned that I watched this movie on TV and with dubbed English - which may have completely spoiled the atmosphere. However, I consider what I saw and hope it will steer people away from that version. I found this movie tirelessly boring. All the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing, leaving a slow frustration of a stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow, except when filming philosophy. I saw no deep philosophical significance in this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell it as if I see it. I rated it a "1". What can I say, American oriented tastes, maybe.
