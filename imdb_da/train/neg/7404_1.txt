I was initially interested in this movie after reading a review that said this movie reminded the critic of Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a great Silent Hill fan and disappointed with his movie debut, I thought I would give this one a try. Mind, Fearnet shows only this movie as "dark floors", not with the full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought of the band (I had a couple of college friends who liked them), but didn't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts strongly. Despite the fact that "crazy little girl" has been made into DEATH, the good use of sound and sense of isolation really began to tell the story together. The tense atmosphere was built quickly and any indication pointed out that the film was excellent. As monsters are the real stars of horror, I couldn't wait to see what lurked in the hospital's halls, the protagonists had found themselves trapped in ... And then the first monster showed up and I found myself very underwhelmed. When the other one appeared, I boggled that it looked like it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and silliness completely knocked me off. <br /> <br /> During the film, the atmosphere remained intact and the story left you wondering exactly what was happening, but the scares were largely non-existent. But I kept hoping that the end would make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately, that was not the case. When the film reached that climax, I was in complete displeasure, and I immediately recognized the big bad in his last disclosure ... Lordi's main song? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was that what the movie boiled down to? A lot of poor souls were hunted around a hospital by Lordi band members? The silly monster design suddenly got meaning. If you want to be the corny, just as well through the members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS in there as well. Not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I ended up in one of Lordi's music videos some years ago. They had to go and make a whole movie out of it? <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all, when I found out what really was, was all I could do, a yawn. I won't "ruin" it for you, but I can probably say it's a plot unit you've seen before. Probably more than once. So unless you're a huge Lordi fan, stay away from this. It's not scary, it doesn't bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job borrowing from other horror movies, especially Silent Hill). And I can't stress enough, LORDI is the antagonist. Lordi. Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> It would really be better to try to scare yourself and see Slipknot music videos. In other words, it's just not possible.
