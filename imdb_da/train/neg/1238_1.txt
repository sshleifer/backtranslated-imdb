This Tim Burton remake of the 1968 original "Apesens Planet" (and starring Charleton Heston) is a long way from the original quality and plot. Some special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was horrible. I sat through the whole movie with a friend (who fortunately only rented it) and fully understood why, before Christmas, all the toy plan in Target was in the clearing box. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Don't put this on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone else: See the original 1968 film "The Monkey Plan".
