As an ex-teacher (!) I must confess that cringing through many scenes - 'even though I continued to look to the end. I wonder why ?! (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The initial opening scenes struck me so incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed. Although there were some good ideas - eg. The situation of a relief teacher - was it not enough concentrated enough in any direction for 3-D development. <br /> <br /> Not one of Mr. Nolte's finer moments. As for the young Mr Macchio, does he thus speak in * each * film? <br /> <br /> Plot and action complain aside, the hair styles alone were a nostalgic (if nausea) trip. <br /> <br />
