I have not yet read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I'm going to do for a while. I'm sure it will be scary than this movie. I remember jumping once when I saw it the other day, even though I can't remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good and I saw this on DVD, but I am sure that in the theater it must have been a fantastic sight. After the first few special effects I have been waiting for a story to develop. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie should be at least loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. I was referred to staring at the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the movie because there was nothing else to see. Lili Talor was such a sigh character. I didn't like her little bit, something about whiny people. Also the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon-like Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I couldn't relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some kind of acting. Half three quarters of the way I just died to see a campy Friday the 13th or a screaming Queenish movie! At least there is some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story there, they at least fill up with gory death or attractive women. This had nothing. <br /> <br />
