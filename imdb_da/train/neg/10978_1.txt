Usually when a movie receives a voice from one, it's because a person simply doesn't like it and is annoyed, it doesn't have a lower rating, and so decides to pull it down as much as they can instead of just Give it a low rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. It doesn't matter right and it doesn't have the chance because it doesn't really try to do anything. There are threads of a bad D&D novel kind of plot that doesn't stick together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout. It is clear that no one involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort, for even a very obviously unlikely person's hard work would make up more. A really horrible movie.
