In today's Eastern Europe life is difficult, and for young women, prostitution is one of the only career opportunities, and you are reluctantly taken by Melania. She attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her and pays more and more money on time with her until eventually he will buy her directly. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments for her, and she is generally passed as some piece of luggage without her own feelings. But we are in the "modern art cinema" area, so conventions as narrative structure, illuminate the subject so that it can be seen, camera techniques that add instead of distracting from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned. Much of the time I had no idea what was going to happen and very rarely did I use. People began to finish the screening almost before the last sinkers had arrived, and I don't think I've ever seen so many people go out. <br /> <br /> Pictures are important to the director - characters come off slowly or disappear into a dark screen, we get long long shots of nothing and a sex scene takes place in infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional movie, the sex scenes were remarkably common; Missionary positions between naked people in bed were superfluous and there were no drugs or related bastards. But perhaps these days it is generally unconventional. On the whole, almost without profit. <br /> <br />
