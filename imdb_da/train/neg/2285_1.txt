Well, it's 90 minutes in my life, I'm not coming back. This movie makes teen TV show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". The action was horrid and history unrealistic. Don't let me even start with the real band ahead of this story, lame songs, see, etc. You might believe they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there's not enough irony in the world to accept one. The guitarist is seen as a heroin user, not that I blame him if I was around such a boring band with stale songs and woodworking, I would also inject the horse. <br /> <br /> If you take Music remotely, avoid this at all costs.
