It's hard to know where this customization is going wrong because I think the problem begins with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith has prepared that you do not read them for the detective stories, but for his deeply discouraging and utterly false view of an Africa that does not exist. He has done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not so successful, but based on such a great fact. <br /> <br /> When I first realized it, it ceased to bother me that Jill Scott, an American singer / actress, was cast as Mma Ramotswe. If she is to represent a country that is not Africa, how appropriate is she a black woman who is not African? She's not the only American on the pitch; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far too young for the roles they play and too glamorous. Both brutally murder local accents, and both focus entirely on this brutality, failing to offer much in the way of acting. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is bouncy, sweet and soft. Rose's Mma Makutsi is an annoying motorhound bitch. <br /> <br /> The result is almost unmatched. The lead role is only redeemed by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who becomes a decent achievement as Mr JLB Matekoni. Hes coming out smarter and more intense than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for this - he is a shining light in a sea of ​​suck. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid out on the selection of the slaughterers who wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing has always been very entertaining, yet poor. He refuses to be edited. As a result, his books contain experiments in grammar that adjoin the scientific, and signs that change name midway through. It is therefore quite an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse. The dialogue is now very much anchored. Characters are spoken of "opening" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makutsi claims not to have a computer, but given her constantly rebuilt hair, makeup and jewelry, I am surprised that she doesn't have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> So what are we back with here? It is difficult to be concerned about this crappy adaptation, because it is honest that most of the things I like about the original books are nevertheless apocratic. McCall Smith paints a fictitious Botswana populated with sweet, non-threatening black people who are full of entertaining and tasty wisdom nails. It sounds good despite linguistic travesty, but it is a vision of how a particular type of white person wants black people to be. It's just not true. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this show sucks as much as it does. It is still to be seen whether European and American audiences themselves will notice.
