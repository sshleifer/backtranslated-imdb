What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it is in the middle of a jungle of abominable scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wood appearing from the majority of the casting. Many of the characters are violently overlooked, especially the ever-overrated Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very small works in this pretentious waste. Much of the "character development" happens through a silly, anxious voice over and often opposes the behavior of characters on the screen. In fact, it is difficult to even find out who the voice headers are talking about because they describe such different signs to whom we look at the screen! How do we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is supposed to be an irregular, violent and unreliable junkie? One of those stupid voice overs tells us. To cry aloud, the character of his character is half the movie, and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin 'voice over! The right killer are the signs. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the stand, despite the fact that we are constantly reminded that they are intended as artistic paupers. They are all absurdly well-told for "junkies". No one seems to have any real understanding of life on skids or on smack, but it is supposed to be the case with most of them. Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than an everyday TV movie matinée. Crud like this, perfectly shot and technically presented, but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide to be plausible and wobbling for hours without going anywhere. At least Noni comes down to her birthday suit at any given occasion. There is no other healthy reason to endure this junk.
