I'm 17 and I still like most Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movie, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo excursions this decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I didn't expect to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I saw some episodes and expect something very good, but from what I saw it, I was not at all impressed. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday-morning-cardboard standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had a little better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like foreigners, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne when they added a lot to the old episodes, as Scooby Doo was good. I also hated the character changes because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby now played superhero, something they would never have done in movies or in Scooby-Doo Where are you? show. The theme was also not very good either, I can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and designed. Although I recognize that there is a very talented voting, if they had better material and had not been told that they are so different to the original voices as humanly possible, as they did, I must add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was terrible and I am not trying to discredit it, that is what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
