I wonder if there is any meaning in this movie. It's a big joke. Good .. It's entertaining. You will see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a movie. I wonder which audience group this film is primarily aimed at. Priety (a pro) plays a surrogate mother of a good pair of Salman / Rani who wants a child but cannot. I wonder what it would be like if this drama was a starting point from a real couple's life. <br /> <br /> Rani looks forward to another beautiful lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her and Salman. She cares for Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity so they can have some romance. When will the audience get tired of Salman's nakhras. <br /> <br /> Although it's a good past, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
