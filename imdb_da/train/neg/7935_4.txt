I blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say that at least it is worth renting for some chilly deaths and ridiculous plays. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say that I was beautifully entertained. I suppose it could be called so bad-it is good. <br /> <br /> As I said, the play is terrible, I feel I could have done a better job, at least showing some emotion. The story is nothing new and has been made better. I think I just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type of movie. I would say rent this or download it but certainly not buy it. It's not worth more than a watch.
