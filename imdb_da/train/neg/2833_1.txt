With a Bo Derek movie, the audience only gets what they expect. A paper thin plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek without clothes. 'Ghosts can't do it' is just that. The first fifteen minutes is regular television drama as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in many different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor must work just for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly beautiful young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad plays, rent a porn movie.
