I will keep this as short as possible as this piece of shit hardly guarantees a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made - right up there with Schnaas' other horrible zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films suck so badly that everyone involved in their creation must shoot. I somehow managed (hardly) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but the ZOMBIE 90 is so awful - even to Schnaa's other horrible movie - that I had to speed through everything after the first 10 minutes. ZERO working skills, ghastly doing, horrible camera-recorded camera work, ridiculous copying ... it just goes over and over again. I really can't find a single thing about this waste - and I can usually find some cash in almost any movie. This really is one of the worst movies ever made - you have been warned ... 1/10
