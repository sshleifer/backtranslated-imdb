When the movie started, I was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home video. Even direct to DVD movies should have production values ​​better than this! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Too often, the movie looks serious by holding the camera on a tripod and turning it on - without the camera person! Close-ups and everything reminiscent of camera work are absent in some scenes where they may have worked, and in others there are too many or poorly framed close-ups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film is about two gay men who want to get married. As if made almost a decade ago, their only option in Vermont married - times are certainly changed. However, the recent acceptance of homosexual marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film - if that is the case, the homosexual marriage supporters return instead of helping as the film stinks and never tries to seriously address the problem. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry Bibles everywhere, and shoot people as well as wives who have homosexual husbands are willing when they teach their spouses, have lived a lie figure. I'm sure it gives an honest chance for both sides of the problem! <br /> <br /> The bottom line - nothing about the movie shows any professionalism at all, and I hesitate to call this a movie. It's more like a home video and doesn't deserve a listing on IMDb or even recording on IMDb's list 100 of the worst-rated movies all the time. The action is horrible, the writing is horrible, the direction (if even any) is horrible, the camera work is terrible and the plot is terrible. It's a home video !! There is nothing positive I can say about this in any way, except that it makes Ed Woods film like Oscar competitors in comparison, and I'm sure Woods ghost smiles every time someone sees this mess! <br /> <br /> I don't care if you are gay or straight - this movie isn't worth your time and I don't know how they managed to make DVDs of it. I suppose one of the actors is burning them on his home computer in his spare time! Seriously, this gives new expression to the word 'bad'! <br /> <br /> By the way, if one lady in the movie was a real lawyer, the ability to read would be an important prerequisite?! I'm just saying. "<br /> <br /> Finally, if gay marriage is such a serious and important issue, we can't have a movie that is BETTER than this that solves the problem? Unfortunately, this only invites laughter.
