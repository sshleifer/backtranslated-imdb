Many years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the play memorable and the story a classic. Recently, I bought the trilogy, and after seeing part 1 again, I was eager to see part 2 ...... I was so happy to realize in part 2 that here was an appropriate follow up to it great godfather again was almost perfect and i couldn't wait to see the godfather III ........ HORRIBLE! I wish I was stopped by II. The story was not good, it seemed to me as a story made to get a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protocols were a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2. So scenes like Corleone were invested with all catastrophic full-calamity disasters, the equestrian murder and drove into the sunset, the unseen helicopter awarding the meeting (where 'treats' are gone and everyone else is shot), daughter and 1st cousin rolling piece of pasta across a table, the pathetic shooting on the stairs ..... Corleone stuffed him sweetly with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and rowdy are not ready for an emergency?) ... NO it wasn't good and with the best will in the world I can't see it again. But I will see 1 & 2 many times down the years.
