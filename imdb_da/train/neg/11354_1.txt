I have also interpreted hundreds of children's films earlier, consider this to be one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I disrupt this day and age to explain to my children that Russia is not "the evil". Also the mocking Russian names like "Poopchev" are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The Grandfar's birthday scene featured a quasi-sexist joke, realizing that men are drinking beer and women are talking on the phone. Two other flies also unnecessarily use the word "crap" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie tastes largely of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda, which I thought we as a nation were proud to have risen above. br /> In all, it's just raw, poorly animated, even more poorly written and not worth wasting time to see.
