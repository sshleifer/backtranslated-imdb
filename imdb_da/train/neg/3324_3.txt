I saw this by accident a lazy summer afternoon. It played on HBO's family programming channel. First I was pulled in, by what I thought was a Disney animation. But then after a few minutes I tried to look for the remote control myself so I could find 'INFO BUTTON' to find out what the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F. I enjoy him in many of his films, but one thing he is not is a voice-over artist. Sure he has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Attach his voice to a sweet duck that made seeing something difficult. As for the rest of the cast, uninspired. I assume that working on this movie did not appeal to the really good voice over talent out there. So weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was this movie targeting? Gay ducks? I do not understand it. Is there really a lack of role models for young people and do homosexuals come to us for animated ducks? Sweet story, and as the title, this movie I found hard to love, like a nasty duckling.
