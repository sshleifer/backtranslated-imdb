As one who has read the book, I can say that this is far subordinate to the great American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. First, Emma is too uncomfortable. Yes, she's wrong and isn't the easiest person to suffer - but the viewer shouldn't even begin to despise her. Secondly, Mr Knightly is mistaken. His brooding and melancholy in this version is better suited for a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen, and throws the mood throughout the affair "off". Third, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be referred to the role of Harriet; And why was she made to look so sick? Harriet must be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she is being worn by consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. In the end, when Emma decides that she loves Mr Knightly, it comes across as completely confusing because this story has not been shown adequately and accomplished throughout the film. Fifth, what exactly happened to Mrs Elton's accent? She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning to all Americans halfway through and then back to English at the end. Finally, it drew to the end. The book and the big movie version ends with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly. This version confuses the wedding announcement without showing us the ceremony. All in all, a pretty random attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead
