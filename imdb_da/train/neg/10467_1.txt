If there was ever a call to make a bad movie that reflected how stupid humanity could be, this would take the price. The plot is centered around Bible prophecies, which lie in hidden messages of the scriptures, causing a group of power-seeking bullies to attempt total control of the world. How stupid does this author believe that people are actually? <br /> <br /> The action was bad at best. Casper Van Dien wasted his talent in making this movie. Michael York's work was a fair struggle for the role when he was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was sick and very disturbing. No bid or immature mind should watch this movie. It is true that a basic good vs evil can go astray. There must be a lot of mental illness floating around in the movie circles, which are looking for ways to market this type of junk. There must have been something censored out to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
