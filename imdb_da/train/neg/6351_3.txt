Any spoilers. Although there was some good acting - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half - it was simply not an engaging movie. The victories between comedy and tragedy were awkward or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the support support differs in the two halves; I wondered how things were put into the opening scene, that the people around Melinda would be the same people, just react differently (more of a "He said she said"). However, what we have is two completely different stories and two completely different women, both of which have been played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two dramatists in the opening scene - comedians and tragedies - supposedly take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are only closely related. They do little to support the discussion topic, which is that almost everything can be seen as either comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but a disappointing movie.
