What was the deal with the clothes? They were all dressed as something out of the late 70's in the early 80s. The cars themselves were outdated. The school was outdated. The nun apparel was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40s with its departments and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the whole movie suggested it took place in 1991. My mother laughed and said "Geeeee-od! When was this movie made?" When we printed "INFO BUTTON" on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 had to write! Did others notice it? My FAVORITE part was, however, when the woman tells her opity muck man on the phone about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just says "Well, see, I have a congressional meeting. I'll talk to you about it later." just classic. LIKE A MAN! My mother's favorite part was when they gave "The Devil Child's Spa" their very own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Just what the devil's hoof needs ... a rottweiler". She also enjoyed all the people collapsing in the churches and hugging their chests. Her other favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot, drove 5 miles an hour, drove straight into the trash / dump truck / front loader thingee. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car ... but he just kept on with a really stupid free look on his face. I mean how fast can you go to a school parking lot?!?! No matter what!
