* SPOILERS * <br /> I'm sure back, as this was released in 1958, it was very appropriate for its time. Then the movies became slower so that the audience could follow and analyze the story. Here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife, who died mysteriously with his new wife. Gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed movies) is really an underappreciated character. He causes a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble when he knew there was a mistake in the death of the first wife. He can't tell Jenni directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with the skull. Jenni, we also find out, so her parents die and thus cause a lifetime of mental anxiety that leads to institutionalization. Like many audiences today, I found the pacing to be a little too slow for my taste. But if you like slow-paced horror without a lot of doing, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
