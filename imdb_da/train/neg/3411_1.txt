Among exotic tropical places, babes in skimpy outfits, explosions, great Dudley Do-Right clones, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), a small martial art and a sexy scrub (Tracy Lor .... sorry. .. Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you think you would be part of some escapist fun. Not so! This is a boring television movie, and although it likes to promote itself as a "Charlie's Angels" deal, it's not as close to the original series or even the gawdawful, inevitably stupid, recent C.A. movie. This abomination is best described as a third-rate Andy Sidari movie. Nowhere near as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some of the battle scenes are decent enough. The girls spend too much time presenting and trying to look prissy and it gets annoying after a while. There are better genre things that this out there. Oh yes, and "babes" are not as hot as they like to believe they are. Terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
