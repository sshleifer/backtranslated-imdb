*** TRANSPARENT CAN CONTAIN AS SPOILERS *** I want to make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top players in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist stumbling across a case that could lead to corrupt police at Edison's police force. LL Cool J is Deed, a police officer within the force of a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He is with an "on-the-edge" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene, we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they break a couple of boys who make fabrics. I don't want to give too much away, but things get bad, because the boys make the fabrics. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to a trial with Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects evil games and examines some of Ashford's help that gets ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), who are all within F.R.A.T. team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt policemen to justice. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the outset that Freeman and Spacey's performance is pretty unclear. The only person who gives an all-out performance is Dylan McDermott. He's a complete nut-case in this movie and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says every line in the same way and shows almost the same feeling. He was much better at movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with some fine actions, but then it draws its feet through the rest of the film. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. I put it on Ebay this weekend.
