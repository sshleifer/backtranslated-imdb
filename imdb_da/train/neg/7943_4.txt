The seventh sign has a good opening hook when the Israeli defense comes across a terrorist base. This is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script, it addresses the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon when he rents a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn the telegraph point that this is a man who is not who he says he is But after the big opening third, I found the rest of the movie confusing and involved with a large number of plotholes and is not all that different from other other supernatural thrillers I have seen
