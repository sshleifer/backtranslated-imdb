So this guy named George is sitting alone at home on his birthday when two women come up. George's wife is in a hospital that takes care of their son, so when wife is gone, George enters the spa and loves both girls. It's not that big of a scene because it really doesn't show anything. Then the birth boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still in the house. They make him a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy, and he tries to ditch them, but when he comes home, the girls are still home with him. The girls have had enough with old George and will no longer cook for them. They both turn out to be great psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked the girls just doing what they wanted and shaking at George's house. George was not so great for his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he didn't really mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker at Family Guy. I was for the two girls all the time.
