It really scares me when someone crosses a movie like this and claims to be one of the worst slasher movies out there. This is by far not one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst anyway. Go see something like Death Hospital or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think Night Bring's Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is far more than I can say to many more extremely unclear slasher movies. <br /> <br /> The movie does not deliver on-screen deaths, there is a death where you see his pruning tear in a throat, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a slasher movie, just a bad one. Of course, the film was not meant to be taken too seriously. The movie came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it was definitely a reflection on traditional slasher elements made in a tongue on the cheek way. For example, after a killing, Charlie goes to the city's welcome sign and marks the population down a smaller one. This is something that can only laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're in a slasher movie, definitely give this movie a watch. It's a little different from your usual slasher movie with the option of two killers, but not too much. Comedy in the movie tells the general public to relax and not take the film so god darn serious. You can forget about the movie, you can remember it. I remember that because I love the name.
