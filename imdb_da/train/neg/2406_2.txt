From the thought of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of film slam. Probably based on H. Rider Haggard's work, the only resemblance that Haggard has actually written is that it is happening in Africa (albeit an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our eerie adventurers use to pull their canoes!) And have some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to seek treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up exactly where the treasure is, by chance. Along the way, they meet a modley assortment of extremely lame monsters, fetch a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the Phenicia Queen. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's a hoot. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 1.
