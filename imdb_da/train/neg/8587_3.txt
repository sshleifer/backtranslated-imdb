This kind of storytelling is unacceptable. The only reason this movie is 5 stars out of 10 lines is because it has George Lucas behind it, and it has the words "Star" and "Wars" in the title. It is an insult to hopeful filmmakers and many others out there who have made clear superior movies with superior history, writing and action, but didn't get the credit. This is a travesty. <br /> <br /> First thing first. The story. Anakin's Evolution? There is no. Except for a small make-up around the eyes, and a little screaming, there is none. He gets young, stupid, cold Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow. The only thing that was consistent with Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, it's called. The only consistent thing about Anakin perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. He even loses his body because of a bully of stupid cluster. <br /> <br /> What part of Emperor Palpatine telling him legends from Sith does not indicate that the emperor is a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The battle scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone flies everywhere as a teddy bear in a make-believe dollhouse. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every giant had a rubbery digital double-skirt around. In a particular battle scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climatic battle, both both actually stop in the middle of the parries and ripostes, twisting their saber a few times while inching apart. I realize the fighting is choreographed, but it made me shake my head in disbelief and disgust. Scripture was horrible. All the dialogues were of very low quality. The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but it just wasn't enough. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. For many special effects, plot holes larger than the center of the universe, and absolutely no insight into any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake in this movie: nothing new is offered. We know the rough picture of everything, everything that Lucas did was the color of it. <br /> <br /> We knew Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister, we knew Luke is Anakin's son, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda were in exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this movie. If that's what all fans want, then that's fine, Lucas couldn't have gone wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally gets Darth Vader and he asks for Padme and hears that she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams "Nooooooooooooooooooooo." The scene screamed B-movies all the way and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go "DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER" anytime. That's what this is. A B-movie, disguised by a large budget and an ultra-loyalist fan base that will cope with something now, as the first two movies have drawn their standards down to the earth's pits.
