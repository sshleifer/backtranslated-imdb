This movie is self-rubbing nonsense. Watch this movie if you just want to hear spoke Gaelic or enjoy the nice soundtrack. Beware of other reasons and you will be disappointed. It should be charming, but it's not - it's just annoying. The characters are hard to care for and the play is poor. The stories in the film are also charming and scary. I was expecting a heart-warming family movie, but it was also no appeal to my fourteen-year-old daughter. It is rare that I cannot see a movie through to its conclusion, but this one became better for both of us. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is set in the present times, it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War. There is not even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenes and cinema to redeem it. A real shame because, like a movie, it's a shame for Scotland.
