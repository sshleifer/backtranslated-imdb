This could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't see how it could ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? It's more like a carving drama. the scary music is excellent, but as there were no scary situations, the instructor thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities such as taking a dump or going down the stairs. the film had so much potential. they had beautiful movies (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the authors assumed that you already knew them. they would undergo special activities without explanation or even a clue as to what they meant. This is simply one of the movies that says about one thing and it's something completely different.
