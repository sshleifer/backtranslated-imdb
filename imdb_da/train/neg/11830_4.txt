OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a bit old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat living in a palace. Then a sewer rat owes him to a toilet! He ends up in this rat town and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy seed wants. He will do everything for this gem, he sends a whole army after these two rats. He plans to take the gem and to flood the rat city! The cool part about this movie is the gossip. They make all sound effects. They sing, make sounds, it's great, it's also quite fun. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Second wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was real dream art, but more like WAllace and Gromit. I threw a little on it. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $ 9.50 for though sorry.
