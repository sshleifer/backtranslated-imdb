I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I couldn't get into this story because the two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to fall in love with themselves for one thing. I admit that there were some wise dialogues in the show, which was an important part of the success of the TV program, and I greatly appreciated that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, it was almost like the old screw-basketball comedy film from the 30s and 40s with male against women. You get lots of arguments, accusations, shouts and screams. Many people seem to be such a bickering, but I hate it, so I never came to Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as the rude assistant "Agnes" was entertaining. It was too bad, she had so little air time. Shepherd was leaking on the eyes, and I suppose women would say the same for Willis, but too much arguing between the two finally knocked me off.
