In fact, had to stop it. Don't make me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this was too boring, regardless of the exciting music that never leads you anywhere. The actor had too many teeth, and the moment she contacted one of the animals was far too obvious a clich√©. This movie completely confuses the cover of the DVD, which looks quite interesting. From the front you expect a big monster, but you do not get these sweet as gigantic as expected electric eels. Moved on to see another movie called The Killer Rats, but it's another review. Deep Shock was really crap, a big shame considering the fact that it looks quite high budget.
