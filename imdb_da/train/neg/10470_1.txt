What's more to say? <br /> <br /> I've read all the reviews here and most are right on. . But a person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that Satan threw it (or something like that). Evil?! Wow, what a choke. . I mean, TBN basically made this movie. Open your eyes thankfully. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was the very best class of propoghanda nonsense that has come together this year. <br /> <br /> The most scary thing about the Omega Code is how much money they used to do it. If this movie can be made, there are no limitations, and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest lose the omega codes." <br /> <br /> For those of you in the biblical stories, the new movie Dogma will pick up where the Omega Code never started.
