I draw attention to watching bad movies often, and the sci-fi channel's original movies tend to be one of the best sources of these movies you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of oblivion. The play was uncharacteristically sub-par, unlike the sad scandalous screen sci-fi usually has in store for us. There are a few cameos made by people you will probably recognize, even though you may not know their names of the heart. CGI special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy is missing in a sci-fi function. Sure there are some fun moments like when a guy is beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the protagonist leaves his friend to die to save a girl, he is known for a few days, but on the whole it just ends Not having you rolling on the floor with laughter, and I consider it a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I rated it on a 10-star scale that was made specifically to judge for television films, I'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I have to wait for the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh, and I really hope that this movie is not part of an overall quality enhancement in sci-fi original movies.
