I was fully amped up to watch this movie. I had waited a year to be cleared here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself so much because it was so disappointing and undoubtedly Clark's worst movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. First of all, some of the actors are great, especially Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't remember her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's movie now, and he was so brilliant in 'Children', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity that he transforms the scenes into a parody. The play felt as if it had been written by a first-year film student. No, sorry, a high school student ... someone who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't understand Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaninglessness of these children's existence? It was probably like hell, didn't stop him from coming in a wonderfully good perv. I'm not a prude, but I didn't need to see teen boobs and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best movie is 'Another Day of Paradise'. It's great, and I don't think he'll ever do it.
