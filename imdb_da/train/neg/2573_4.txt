If you have plenty of time to waste ... it's okay. It moves at a good pace, but to pull this movie away it must be a little longer with a little more background on the seat. <br /> <br /> The action is ok. Mariana Klaveno, who sits doing the best work and is the most credible. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a pretty good role as a man. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, who the wife had a weak share and the reasons she went back to work, was not developed. The end is kind of silly. Like most of these sitting movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but generally you let yourself wonder why you spent the time.
