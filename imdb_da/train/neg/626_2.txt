The spirit of a murdered high school animates a scarecrow who then avenges everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really annoyed me. It has a beautiful monster, has some good low budget effects, some atmosphere, but manages to short the good things with bad. Halfway I started to fast forward and then go through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie are many. First out of the cast look about thirty and yet they assume to be in high school. You do not believe in anything that comes from coming as a result. Bird scare while looking good is not much beyond that. He says stupid lines and moves in a way that is more designed to be fun and frightening. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? It is a problem that goes beyond one liners to much of dialogue and setup. It seems that more of each clich√© is sent out than in-depth horror movies. I expect the movie was made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who will fool the genre instead of embracing it. <br /> <br /> Despite its great looks, this is a movie to avoid. Even if you put it in the buyer for less than five bucks, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
