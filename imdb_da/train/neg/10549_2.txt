The film industry is difficult business - because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too. It is the very original treatise of this weak attempt to make an 'insightful' film about movies. And it's no better proof of the industry's trickiness than seeing Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell caught in this inanity. The insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit as "should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I make an indie element and be true to my artistic self?" "Do the last, thank you." Or, "Our relationship is not only professional, it's also private. It's a pretty complex situation to deal with, isn't it?" "Yes, it's my dear." Between the endless dialogues you get a glimpse of palm trees, hotel lobbies and American movie posters (no sign of non-American film presence on the Croisette). Recurring slumber sessions are inevitable, making the 100 minutes of the movie feel like ages. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly convincing to justify her own presence in the frame.
