This movie was horrible. The first half hour is much like a ... well sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! It was apparently a tribute, which according to Clockwork the poster's appearance on the protagonist's wall, but "ripoff" is the more appropriate word. The movie felt like it was being torn from the Kubrick classic, only filmed through the eyes of a new instructor. A blind director. Unfortunately, when it stops its massacre of Kubrick's work, the film gets even worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this movie is just pushed down the neck. Arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel. Perhaps the protagonists will ramblings touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I guess if anyone could be able to feel something for him, it would be me. Terrible character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part about this movie is the title. For a movie called "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is hardly a factor in the girl. See the first paragraph - it was such a slaughterhouse of a clockwork orange I can't get over it. A more appropriate title would have been "16 years of violence" or even better, "A Clockwork Banana". <br /> <br /> Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it out anyway, you must drink. Trust me.
