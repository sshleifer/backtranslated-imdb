It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers work may be disappointed with this, his last venture. But surely any fan of Sellers will find joy in all his films simply because of man's huge talent. and Dr. Fu Manchu's Fiendish Plot is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, it will prove to be Sellers' last movie (it was even released after his death), but it is still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right to his unnoticed death. And not only do we get a Sellers, but we get to, because Sellers not only plays the title role, but also his nemesis, the just bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective of the hunt for the crazy 168-year-old Fu. The story is just as unusual as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his aging elixir and also Nayland and his group of contributors try to prevent him. Like all Sellers' larger films, the movie comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him, as well as many of his famous stars, David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. It's also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoying a cameo with Sellers - though it plays the same role but still nicely. The story is actually quite ridiculous, like many of the characters involved, which classify this as a movie strongly under the Goon influence. And although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy, there are lots of fun jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially on the first release because of the whole world's grief after Sellers death (the movie was released less than 3 weeks later) and there is always the sad thought that lurks behind you when you see that this was Sellers' last movie. It's far from a big movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes the jokes are simply not there - but it's nonetheless enjoyable - if it's just for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers.
