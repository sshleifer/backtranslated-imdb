It is "The F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley, with an all-star guest cast! The movie begins with an unintentional (practical) kidnapping that leads to one thing and another - which does not really indicate the main story, which is a "Big House, USA" prison break history. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a television show, just more "violent" (for the times). BUT - the throw is a trip! Picture this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; his cellmates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a "Muscle" magazine!) and William Talman (reading a "Detective" magazine!). Honest! You should know, an early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy that corresponds to the final "voiceover". If you don't want to hang around, don't miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian does well as an asthma). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W.
