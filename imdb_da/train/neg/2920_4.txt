Wow! I am shocked to learn that it is a small world and that we are all together. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne put it much better in a sentence. "No man is an island." The action was not bad. The children gave everything they had, but at times the thread became so thin that I couldn't follow it, and the only real "hero" in the movie ended up in jail after being plagued by a maid. I do not know. I just don't understand that. Oh good.
