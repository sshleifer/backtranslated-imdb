For me it is a story that starts with some funny jokes about Frank's fanatics as he travels with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that after watching this movie for an hour, you'll see The same fantasies / fun situations over and over and over again. It is to predict. It's more done like a television story where you can walk away and come back without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank, but that's not enough, even when it's a comedy, it must have more variations and a kind of message to that audience .... <br /> <br />
