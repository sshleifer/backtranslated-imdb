The world can be completed. Unfortunately, this film survived as another testament to Canada's inability to make movies that go beyond the executable. Maybe it's because all our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short et al.) Go to Hollywood.) In fact, the wrong map was not thrown into this eerie pretentious and banal movie. He could have given it some credibility. The Canadian government should realize --- and this movie is a magnificent example --- shoveling money into the trough does not result in good cinema. If the people patched up, these public funds would have had to compete, they might have been forced to make something worthwhile. As it is, they have produced another snickering embarrassment.
