The movie started out strongly, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from Practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) Commit robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer who creates a sinister policeman's conflict with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well cast and the film shows promise. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to fall as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Considering the possibility of making a good movie that people might want to see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go to see once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors must work hard on their craft; Timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought he would bet on a better show when he had acted talented for years. Everything he did in this movie was convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it doesn't automatically translate them into acting successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of actress. <br /> <br /> There are a few plot holes, like Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of storage machines. This movie had so much promise. Thoroughly disappointing.
