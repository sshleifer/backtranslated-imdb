I'm a big fan of the 50's sci-fi, but it's not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi-flick, the director figured too much to carry the movie. It is clear that he worked without money because the whole movie is filled with soft dialogue going on forever. I have never seen so much time consuming in a movie. There is probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" throughout the movie, and most of it all is engaging in a lot of poorly written, ongoing dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good heavens ... how could casting have thought that anyone in their real mind would believe them as teenagers?
