Turns the evil guys ... Again, the tagline for this movie is, it exposes so much truth about it. Home Alone one and two, movie classics. Home Alone three and four, a good movie, if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be fun, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very bland actor with gentle performances, but it is not entirely his fault, the letter required gentle vocabulary and gentle expressions. The pranks have just been copied from the first two with different villains, and you have to be blind to believe that these chicken pounds are real. A great choice if you are a preschool teacher showing this movie on a rainy day. And to get the worst, a completely different cast, see if you don't believe me, but you will regret it.
