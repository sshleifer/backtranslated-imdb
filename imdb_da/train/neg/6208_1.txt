There is only one word for this movie. Appalling. The director obviously has talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray he can't bother using it. Being drawn into crime and then descending into depravity is Cray's vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids, this film depicts young people without aspirations or respect. Cray is crying for attention, but deserves no one. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the violence Cray chose to push in the audience. He assumes that the audience is unaware of the world's atrocities. As a piece of indecent graffiti on a toilet wall, he shows us male depravity with youth glow. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both do short shows. The action is otherwise amateur, the young men Joe and Ben are cringe making. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is scary. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of the celeb chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); How she was able to submit to such an ordeal is convinced. The film is never subtle, and Monica is being treated to the most volatile violence cut with war action. War images are used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves that acts of violence will occur in just "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and is symptomatic of our changing society, where men have an increasingly important position, but Cray goes down to the level of barbaric men he is seeking to reveal through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female figures in the film provide no relief. They are either victims or in the Manville case a leaching mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first movie. I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligible, he only lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film will be released later this year, but I hope the company breaks down because the public really doesn't need this kind of messed up material.
