Once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy shot into the room, probably going to Saturn, but only for some sunlight shots, and then he gets a nosebleed and before you know what he is in a hospital-bound head on foot, and then an overweight nurse with a poor fit comes in and is eaten by the guy who was going to melt everywhere but never seems to lose any mass and then NASA, or at least a guy at NASA, gets upset and call another guy to chase him down, but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy must go home and have soup first, and his strange shaped wife forgot the crackers so he can't have crackers, and he should go out and look for the melting guy with a geiger counter, and it doesn't really work so he only really follows the track of half dead body, and then there's something about a sheriff and two ugly old people in a lemon grove and a woman with a meat digestion, a d kind of industrial plants with triggered security guards, and since I can't tell you how the movies end, I can only say that Jonathan Demme is in somewhere with a guy with the stupid name Burr DeBenning, and if there is any justice in the world, everyone with this movie died a violent, violent death and could not make more films, and the world lived HAPPY EVER AFTER - EVER!
