Without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women who are driven to steal banks, which we somehow have to sympathize with. It is difficult to sympathize with signs that continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the police are on us, they know who we are, what do we do? ... Let's rob a bank more, so we're out here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype, and it is easy to tell who will end up dying.
