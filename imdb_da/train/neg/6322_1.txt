This was among STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of the anti-nuke films of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star could "change the world" is pretty much removed, given how many "children's peace marches" and "celebrities" were and are. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would accept a TOTAL nuclear disarmament because some appliance children learned from a "silent protest" in the West is ridiculous. What ended the Cold War? America is hard, I dare say "Reaganesian" attitude and internal errors in socialism. There were no peace marches, "die-ins" or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
