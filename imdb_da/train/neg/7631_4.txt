I'm not going to fight over TLPS obvious peterbogdanovichian errors. Instead, I look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygm in a movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be maintained in its entirety. This fact alone puts the film high and right up to the top of his lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky lovers can be by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (his then crazy) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just one, but twice . Brava! The undeniable highlights of this cinematic festival season. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has hardly a scene without stereotypical country music that kills in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the film is set in America's Deep South (as if it wasn't blown obvious), so he hammered the point over and over again ...) How is this an advantage, can you maybe ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases to massage your tired ear-drums, you begin to experience a strange excitement: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that someday they can snatch a much younger and maybe even nice girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I do not technically recognize as part of TLPS) gives hope to all women who resemble that one day they can also win a Miss Chicago beauty competitor. (Assuming they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm doing fun near Cloris, who has won a beauty contest, huh? Well, check out here the cinema and then we see who laughs lately ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, which spared us from the face of Cloris Leachman's face in his original, natural, non-glory.
