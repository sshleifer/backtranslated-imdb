Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partially when casting Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the entire movie with a confused look at her face and it's hard to tell what David Schwimmer herself sees in her. <br /> <br /> But The Pallbearer is sometimes fun, especially the church scene and the group stage with his friends is a laugh, but that's basically it. See Pallbearer only for these scenes and fast-paced rest. Believe me, you are not missing much.
