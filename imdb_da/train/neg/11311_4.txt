I remember guarding Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days in the 60s, I made several interviews and bios of blurry actors / actresses, especially Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at a low-lying Sci-Fi con in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a good conversation with him and his "career" and life. All of these were published in some now-forgotten fanzines of the day. If I still wanted copies of these interviews, but time is running out, and some of these people would definitely not remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice guy who got himself a living. (The downsides of these days didn't even pay their guest unless of course they were big name stars, and even then the pay was a maximum of a few hundred dollars! Good to know Ben is still alive and kicking! How is a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly so ugly now!
