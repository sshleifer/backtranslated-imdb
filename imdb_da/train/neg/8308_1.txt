Entertainment Tonight you have gone downhill for the last couple of years, but from last night (August 17, 2006) they reached a new low. In an attempt to speed up their broadcast, they decided to send actual images of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers last night ... and say "Pictures from the case you've never seen before". The two pictures were graphic and very disturbing. One was by the side of her face and head / neck, and you could clearly see the cord used to choke her around her neck and blow on her face. This was so shamefully horrible, I couldn't believe it. How does it relate to anything remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ?? Nothing!! They have dropped their level of dignity and values ​​to a new low .... and it shows. This used to be the premiere show to watch ... and it's just garbage now. <br /> <br /> I want to see Access Hollywood from now on.
