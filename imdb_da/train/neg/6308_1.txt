Full marks for the content of this movie, like a Brit, I did not realize that there was separation in the US Navy during World War II. A very courageous attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction is non existent, the play is wood and the script is only a clich√© after another. I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat and crumpled from the beginning to the end in the very bad way that this had been put together. This could have been a great movie, the story of many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact is the matter as it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been wasted on a low-budget, ill-directed movie. I only hope that a time in the future one of the big studios will take this theme and do it fairly.
