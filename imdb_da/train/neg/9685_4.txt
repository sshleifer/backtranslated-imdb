I don't know about you, but I've always felt drawn to the 'ART' cinema. The first art movie I managed to grab was Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Law", which blew my mind and the creative germ of exaggeration. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... it was what the art cinema was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing visceral to the screen with purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in a food house, and art expressed it for what it is. I love movies of all types, but especially those who both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with it's attitude or no ... "8 1/2 WOMEN", is a dry, clinical "comedy" where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very short allusion to Fellini in the movie, as opposed to what the previews have suggested. The film's main focus falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son, gathered after the death of the mothers. In the early stages of the movie, the sadness of the fathers is credible, you can feel his pain. What happened afterwards is clear by Greenaway standards, harem gathering, love and death observations, and meat is shown for meat sake ... You can argue this, but I feel the movie is low and meaningless. And the idea that this could be a comedy is confusing to me. It's mostly if it's fine ... especially good is Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy should put the clothes on again). What the movie lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touches on profits that made his other movies look so wonderful. <br /> <br /> Whilst filled with moments of insight, and occasionally taboo, "8 1/2 Women" is cut and inserted to be considered art, too bland to be fun and simply too boring to considered worth. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as sleeping help. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
