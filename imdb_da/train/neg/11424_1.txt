I noticed that "Fire" was on cable the second night and I started to see it because I couldn't remember anything specific about the other thing than I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it back in '85. Twenty years later, the film is still horrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in the pop music of the 1980s, as evidenced by the title song. When I heard that song again, I wanted to scrub a screwdriver in my ears to finish the sonic misery inflicted on them. And to put together this musical assault Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and there was a scene where he played a solo that continued as if he were Charlie Parker, only his sharp tone and play reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unpleasant, though I have to say they did a good job of throwing equally unpleasant actors to portray them. In fact, I thought Mare Winningham was appealing, and I originally felt sorry for her character because she had fun underwear, but then at the end of the movie she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character, which would probably be voted for To be most likely to transmit a wide variety of sexual diseases if such things were voted on.
