These are some of the worst actions I've ever seen. I love Almereydas Nadja, but it's just absolutely drunk. Apart from a few moments of interesting film and music, this movie is just nonstop bad acting and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly poor, but no one in this is externally good. The ground is a joke, but not the haha ​​kind. I don't even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Please delete the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director Nadja and another girl make another planet?
