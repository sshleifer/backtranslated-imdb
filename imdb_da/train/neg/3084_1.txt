this is the result. A piece of garbage game that doesn't deserve to be classified as a movie is just a bunch of stuff on a movie reel, it makes no sense at all. Well back to the actors, who from the beginning seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get some money together and try to make a movie that would be a big scary movie. Well it is still a great horror, never to be a movie. There are lots of horrific acts in "Hobgoblins", but the worse is the main guy named Richard, who is just too much of a swing to even sorta root for. Well, when you throw a bunch of friends and try to make the movie scary, on a less-than-budget, no less, that's what will happen. Oh well, at least the MST3K version was fun. But it's still a horrid movie that deserves all the bashing it gets. 9 for the MST version.
