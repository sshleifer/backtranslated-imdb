Batman The mystery of the Batwoman is in a word obsolete. <br /> <br /> The reason is that a mysterious female vigilante ("Batwoman") invades Batman's turf, and while Batman is trying to fight a penguin / runway / Rupert Thorne triangle, he tries to find out who mystical Batwoman's. <br /> <br /> There is nothing remarkable about this, but there is nothing really special about it, it notes that it has really gone out. <br /> <br /> The mask of the Phantasm mask had Bruce's elongated love surface and root with his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a great event in Mr Freeze's life. <br /> <br /> Even Batman Beyond movie spin off, Return of the Joker, dug deeply with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But the Mystery of Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formal topped by a mediocre piece on a cruise ship. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, missing beats and bites that the animated series had in the primary.
