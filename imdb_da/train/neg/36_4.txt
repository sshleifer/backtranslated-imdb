This movie seemed too long even in just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror movies is that there are always too many pictures of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to throw away the passage of time. The movie is worth seeing for the ridiculous and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes that are always accompanied by the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be very entertained by the bad English dubbing, free female meat and very stupid makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie / cannibal flick, it was pretty easy on gore but then I probably didn't see an unknown version.
