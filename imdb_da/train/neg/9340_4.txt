It's a wasted throw. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. Normally Roger Ebert doesn't let me go, but I feel cheated after watching this movie. The only excitement is to see Elizabeth knocking in her bra. It's a sorry statement about this movie. It had so much promise, but it was like drying a transvestite. <br /> <br /> These are self-contained bars. <br /> <br /> I can't express deeply my bitterness by having been through this movie and hope I can warn you of the same disappointment.
