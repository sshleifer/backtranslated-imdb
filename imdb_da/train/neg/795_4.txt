When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but it was actually quite different, representing, as it did, what I would describe as an early science fiction effort. Karloff and Lugosi play both scientists (Rukh and Benet) competitors to some extent until Rukh wins the leg with a demonstration proving his great theory. The science here was - at least - a little rough around the edges (ie science fiction with an emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh exploits a kind of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "thousands of Millions of years ago. "In the past, a great meteorite entered Africa, leaving deposits of a substance called scientists" Radium X "- which can cure and destroy. Much of the movie is pretty boring in Africa on a search for the meteorite deposits that Rukh eventually finds and braces to create a great weapon that unfortunately gets infected with some kind of disease that also makes him a good weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both quite good here. Lugosi draws a role where he is the good guy, quite well, although I honestly found him a little convincing - especially during the scenes in Africa. The story also tore a little, and while it was my attention, it didn't find me. Considering that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror-flick, and that the sci-fi was in its very early stages, I assume that the film should cut a little slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4.10
