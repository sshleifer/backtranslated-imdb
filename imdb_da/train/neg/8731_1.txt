the lowest score possible is a star? it's a shame. Really, I want the lobby IMDb for a "zero stars" option. giving this movie even a single star gives WAY too much. am I the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over the skipper's head at the station? and the actor, or should I say the lack thereof? Apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director came to town. My little sister's primary school talent show provides greater reach and depth of emotion. and the fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalkboard. The only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been ... Oh, wait, no no, it's already as bad as it can get.
