This is complete and absolute garbage, a good example of what a bad movie is, it cannot be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans. Do not repeat, do not waste precious lifetimes on this piece of waste. Bad play, poor conducting, horrible (but I really mean terrible) script and complete lack of an idea of ​​what entertainment (of any kind) is. I bought the DVD for 3 dollars, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it wouldn't be enough for what this movie did for me. I like b-movies, killer toys, the strange lagoon monsters, but it's not far near. You know the movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even. Just plain old pathetic.
