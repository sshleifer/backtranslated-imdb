When you see little man, you will spend his time trying to figure out his many plot holes. And this is not a good sign, because this movie should be a comedy! You had to laugh at it !! But will you? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with little man is its concept - it is far too ridiculous to accept (even as a comic book comedy), so when they work high and over the best jokes kick in, they do everything ten times stupid than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy, some of you can scream. It's true, but it's not an excuse for such a stupid plot. I mean, think about it, if you saw a baby with a GROWN MANS FACE, wouldn't you be the least suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why not put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random women's handbag? And how can a qualified doctor not recognize that Calvin is an adult man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about the laughs" you can be screaming. Well heres the case, there is hardly any laugh in little man, and it just makes that stupid ass plot stand out. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a Wayans Brothers Comedy with a faithful suspending plot, stick to white chickens because at least it had a few decent laughs. Anything you steer clear of little man.
