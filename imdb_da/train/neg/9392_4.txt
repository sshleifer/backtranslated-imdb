... and Ethel Merman buffs will also love his tall, bossy vocals like the evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "The Wizard Of Oz" is deprived of true fantasy that replaces fantasy and excitement with noisy action (and cheaply repeats his footage as a bad music video). Little Dorothy is whisked back to Oz, who has gone to ruin and meets old and new friends. The inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less-inspired shows from Hanna-Barbera, but many of the songs are good, especially Dorothy's sweet patting "It's a Far Away Land", superbly done by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, which is why the movie perks up when Dorothy is around. Much of it is unmemorable, and I'm not even sure baby boomers will get a charge from it as it has been out of circulation for so long. As a curiosity, just fair. ** from ****
