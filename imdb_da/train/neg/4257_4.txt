"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students coming across Dracula. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal the blood for auction, it is an offer they can hardly refuse. son students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire guy from the Vatican! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a somewhat entertaining horror movie that has many mistakes. The characters are one-dimensional and the play is quite average. There are some good gore effects like really cool double assault scene, but there is not enough violence to my liking. The movie quickly becomes boring and forgettable, and there is absolutely no excitement. So if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look. I prefer atmospheric vampire coolers from the 60s and early 70s like "Lips of Blood", "The Dracula's Brides" or "Lemora: A Child's Tale of Supernatural" to name just a few.4 out of 10.
