I only rented this movie because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed it by seeing RR's name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would have done if he wants to lend his name to it than it should be right? Incorrectly wrong. By far the worst editing since "Manos Hands of Destiny". The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow, and after the first 30 minutes you will not try to follow it anymore. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez became involved in this movie, maybe they owed someone, but they are too good for this. Besides, they were only in this movie for a few minutes, and Rodriguez didn't even speak. So if you want to see a movie with poor editing, bad acting and confusing history than being my guest, but not saying you weren't warned.
