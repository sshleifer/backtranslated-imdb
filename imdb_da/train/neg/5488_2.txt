Why on earth is Colin Firth in this pointless movie? Has he really been the strapped for cash? The movie is not aware of what it will be about, sorrow? Exotic places, ghosts, a vehicle for Mr Darcy? It's a muddy, muddy mess. There seems to be some kind of idea that Italy should be good in itself and that the Italian has something to offer as a language - but ultimately the girls just want to go back to yankland. <br /> <br /> There are pointless beach breaks, churches, busy roads - but what it's all about or why someone should break is simply not clear. /> <br /> There was also a yank woman in the movie. It wasn't clear what this job was, but she only seemed to be there to make bad, inappropriate and maudlin comments on the girl. Was it supposed to be paedophillia ?? <br /> <br /> A pretty horrible mess, all in all. I gave it 2 rather than 1 because it didn't have the charm of a totally horrible movie.
