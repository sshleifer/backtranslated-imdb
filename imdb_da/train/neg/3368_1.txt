For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and have never seen Robert Wise's 1963 production with Julie Harris, this remake will seem pretty bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who are, it's simply awful. <br /> <br /> Poor acting (what was Neeson's thinking?), cool computer enhancements and a further step away from Jackson's history judge this remake. <Br /> <br /> Make yourself a service and rent the original movie. It still scares effectively without hokey-special effects. The action is professional and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> For the readers of the book, 1963 follows the much closer.
