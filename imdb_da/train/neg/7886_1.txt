I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to see on a Saturday night, I think. But what really tastes me of is when the revaluation on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Refraining from religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, bro. And even though I was a religious person, I would agree with most other posters here, this movie was a mess. Badly directed, badly acted, poorly edited, and attempts at a soundtrack were fun. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and the continuity was out of the window. The only reason we got through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Should just go to bed. Absolutely no redeeming qualities for this movie unless you are the religious type who will immediately join everything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers, even if it is a pile of waste. If you are not, avoid it at all costs. Don't be deceived by the box rewrite.
