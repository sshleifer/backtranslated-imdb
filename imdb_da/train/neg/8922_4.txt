Two old men sitting on a park bench. I really don't have a problem with this scene - Only problem is that it's not a scene, it's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yup movies no longer have a low concept. They also get no more boring than this, but it is worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is Yiddish communist, while the other is Midge Carter a former gold glove champ who is also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench, get it fine. Well, I think it's possible, but unlikely, but if this movie has such an unofficial scenario, why play up to the Jewish stereotype? Why do they make high tribilist robbers who take you Hebrew? A little ironic that the Jews are seen at the beginning of the film is exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem I am not REPORTS, is that it`s written to a completely different medium than the cinema, it is based on a stage game and it shows. Walter Matthau sleeps through his role as Night, while this commentator almost slept throughout the film
