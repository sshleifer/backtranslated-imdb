It has its profit; Morvern Callar is both the benefits and the disappointments. She is so puzzling, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that makes her so distant and unrelated? Or is she, as a reviewer, called her a revolutionary? Personally, I would call her dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern completely loosens. Allocating her boyfriend, not thinking about informing the family or spending the money, he gave her a proper funeral, she jumps selfishly on a trip to Spain. She then seems devoid of any relatively human child formation. The only item that allows the audience to see the human side of her is her close friend she is vacationing with her. Though the end of his friend is dumped and Morvern has nothing that ties her to humanity. She might as well have killed herself. <br /> <br /> Despite having managed to make Spain appear gloomy and bland as the United Kingdom, the director's shot was excellent, the lighting and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> <It's really a shame that the movie has nothing in it that holds interest. It's just over 90 minutes, but feels much longer. They manage to make Morvern interesting to get your attention, but do nothing with her, only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the movie.
