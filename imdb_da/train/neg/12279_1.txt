Although this seems to be quite an old show (2002), I saw my first episode last night, and I must say it should be the worst show. . . ever. I am not one to comment, but I was so shocked that there could be a show that blatantly tries to pander, and I assume only that this was their target audience, children under 12 years old or people with a minor than the average IQ. The episode I was exposed last night contained so many coherent story lines, trying to include every possible plot summary imaginable and constantly trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics !!!. <br /> <br /> Basic story they covered in the episode: Frat House hazing went wrong wrong with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be Senator's son who wants the FBI to investigate. Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator believes it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did it because Senator took money for his votes for the law but eventually got a conscience and said no to mean mullet millionaire. All a suspect, but everyone has the usual alibi (ex-girlfriend student shagging a married teacher, so had to lie, dissatisfied students who were reported by the victim actually had life-changing experience, Senator's enemy did not pay desperate students to kill the sworn enemies son , he gives money freely for many broken students). Yet in this dribbling, staying in "that age" has a love for a boy, who eventually gets the courage to talk to her aunt, but only to dump him because "in" girls says he is not good enough, and so to stick with them she dumps him. Don't worry, she comes back with a boy after she learns the truth about life, and "in" girls drops her, Aunty also explains that God is the only one she can really trust (I was almost sick at this time) . <br /> <br /> This drama gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is. . . You will laugh at this, I certainly did. . . <br /> <br /> It was one of Frat's boys who discovered a year ago that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and he is trying to impress real father by kill boy and plant bomb at funeral. . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard, plays are cardboard continuity, cardboard history is cardboard. Anyone who says they love this show has a brain card. Why the authors of this show have tried to pack into every eventuality in one show means they obviously have no faith in the character development or the ability of the actors to hold a simple plot line. Seeing this show is like watching 'Last Action Hero' with Arnie killing 5'000 people with tooth capture, unless Arnie is a better actor (wow, never thought it would be one day I'd say it !!) <br /> In the words of Simpson's beloved character "cartoon guy". . . . <br /> <br /> WORST TV SHOW. . . . . EVER.
