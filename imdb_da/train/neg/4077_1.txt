What do you get when you have bad acting, poor management, scenes that are relentlessly long, awful lighting, painful editing and horrible effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems its shot at Betacam, which is fine, but the lighting must compliment this medium. In this case, it does not. There are a few CUs where the person's face is completely in shadow. A scene in particular is the stage of the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily be cut in half ... but I guess they wouldn't have a functional length movie. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD male, so he must have some "hero" elements for his character, but he does not. He whines and is afraid of the whole movie. I could go on, but I won't waste my time. Although the lighting was awful, I have to say that they had a good camera movement. Too bad the lighting did not compliment it. The cover on the DVD is nice, and this is where it ends. Just awful.
