There is no question of spoilers for this movie, the director struck us too and spoiled this film in oh so many ways. <br /> <br /> A blatant rip-off of things like Critters and Gremlins fails this movie on so many levels to resume humor and horror of the better-made movies. It ends up with a dizzy waste of time when bad actors deliver poor dialogue in front of an idiot director who occasionally throws stuffed toys on them. They struggle with the said toys in the same way as old Tarzan films are used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them as they scream and trying their best to make it look a little threatening. It is painful to see, and not helped by the mental 80-fashion worn by the cast. In principle, some crazy little aliens who have been caught by an aging security guard in a movie party are finally free after umpteen years of imprisonment, and begin telepathically screwing around with people's minds. The guards new recruits, the idiot who released them despite repeated warnings, gets his gang of 80 friends together and they go out and have less adventures together while trying to resume Grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock, his 80s boyfriend, 'The hero's free and pricy girlfriend, and the young hero, lacking in trust and want his girlfriend to put out anyway. <br /> <br /> First comes the infamous rake battle scene where ex-military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bullying, poking the nerdy completely with the wrong end of a rake for what looks like hours. Then there are some running around and ending up in a real threshing style, ending in a creepy nightclub with comedy hand grenades jumping all over, unless people are standing next to them. Then the movie ends sorta, and at least it ends well. <br /> <br /> That's not it. It's like seeing a train wreck, you can't see the eyes of it, it's so bad. Perfect fare to the Mystery Science Theater, but goddamn you should try to see it alone and incompletely. Fashion Police still has a number of outstanding warrants for the cast, and I dare anyone not to laugh in the direct obstacle in the rake fight. This scores 2 out of 10, on a good day.
