Going into a movie like me here, I was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a kill of kills ..... what I got was even less. Christmas Eve 1947 a child testifies that his parents do it while father is in a suit. Frightened, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later, and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday joe ..... salutation for being obsessed with Santa. After his boss has fun with him, he goes crazy, beats as a santa and starts killing non-santa-believing patrons and his boss. An outrageous neighborhood catches up to him, and just as they are firing him, he drives his van from a rock ..... into the moon. It wasn't the best end I've seen, but it was original. It was a slow boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when Harry went monkey-like on the church goers. There was hardly anything gore and even the "sex" scenes were toned down. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
