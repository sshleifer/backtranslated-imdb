This movie is an excellent example of wiping out big resources in a movie. You will have future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, who mainly make 70 minutes of rough, uninspired farts and racist jokes. The concept of a network from the future subversive society could really have been taken to some interesting extremes, but rather straight out of the gate, making a lame, juvenile proctology joke and remaining in that kind of humor all the way. See the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to watch a time capsule of bad 70's sketch comedy film.
