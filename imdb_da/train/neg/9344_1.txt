As others have pointed out, this film is a bit of pretentious drive for the mindless or masochists. We all know, after seeing trainspotting and acid houses, that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humor or gritty realism movie like this, it doesn't work. And more importantly, without a proper script, a movie won't work and there's nothing new, inspirational or thought-provoking about the script for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how badly the UK film industry is currently. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad I didn't even want to rent it from the weeklies section. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide berth.
