After two long long opening sketches, one of which my brother saw the conclusion, and the other completely joke free, we start the forward-looking party that the GROVER TUBE correctly. Of course, uber-stupid frat boys who are still mainline JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of ​​fecal matter coming out of the single tube, SEX OLYMPICS (I really don't need to give you details, I do) and a clown as basically seen I don't think I've seen about. "fifty times", which is not so much growing, that I will experience it as mildews. Well, more power for you. I just want to express it, despite what you've heard, this movie was by no means a model for the many infinitely more fun movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or whatever. The shit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different, everything you would ever know about sex, and so on. And made way better.
