Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture it (1) it deserved. (For that matter, loyalty to Mr. Falk was what kept me watching this movie all the way from heads to tails.) Even if you forgive all the glorious mistakes, it was just the worst excuse for a television set "Columbo" movie ever. I'm glad I saw it for free on television; would have hated having coughed up for a tap.
