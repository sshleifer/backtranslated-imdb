If you are after the real story of the early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - but if you are looking for a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you have found your movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a basic inaccurate depiction of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that it almost made me cry. (Enter Artemisia inaccuracies into Google and check out some of the facts versus fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view, however, the movie was ok: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES dropped it a little. <br /> <br /> I wonder how director / co-author Agn√®s Merlet vanished his movie at the time? Perhaps she refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate because the laughter faced what she was.
