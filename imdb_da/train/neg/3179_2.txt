I saw this movie accidentally yesterday at a movie theater. I had some hope for the movie because I really like Spoorloos and the book it is based on. The movie starts ok, as at first it seems to be a good thriller. Quickly, even if the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines, characters that never get rid of and no one in the audience fit (like Marjoke) and awful editing. The film has fades for black pieces that are just too long, a shaken chronology that bounces back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and could easily have been lost. Having been through history, you are treated to one of the worst conclusions I have seen for a long time. It should also be mentioned that the film has many explicit sex scenes that you are probably used to if you see many Dutch films. It's hard to mention good things about this movie. About a third of the audience had already left the theater halfway through the movie, and I did not hear a friendly word after the movie was over. Avoid this movie at all costs. It really destroyed any belief I had left in the Dutch film industry.
