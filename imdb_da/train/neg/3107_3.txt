Woody Allen made "September", which showed that even a genius could turn up. This is Mel Brooks "September". Monumentally silly, boring and unfunny, I must confess that I didn't see it through to the end. The flick is among the dishonest few (eg "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") who either put me to sleep or forced me to reach the "rewind" button. And unfortunately I say that as a devoted Mel Brooks fan. He should stick to straight comedy and leave social comments alone. How the same guy who made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could stifle a dog like this is beyond me. Avoid at all costs.
