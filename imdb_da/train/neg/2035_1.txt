I've learned about the Zodiac for four years now. And I'm not saying that I know much more than anyone else ... actually out of most people who know and read and learn about Z, I'm prolonged the one with the least knowledge ... But I know or at least I think I know most things in this would not happen ... From how he signed his name ... to how he killed people ... I thought godfather was the worst movie ever ... < br /> <br /> Kinematics was the five-year-old ... not to say my movies are better, but I'm not someone who makes movies for the mass population ... <br /> <br /> The play I thought for the most part, was pretty good, I really did ... the manager didn't talk much about camera or at all I forget and don't know because I stopped seeing ... his voice overs how good ... But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else ... like a big pizza or something ... <br /> <br /> Until I learn to write a review, Psycho Phil
