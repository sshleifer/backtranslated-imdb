Basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned it hard when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were sent under the collective title 'The Racing Game'. Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey became a private eye after an accident where he lost his right hand, only to have it replaced by an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and resembled one of the evil guys), while Mick Ford (who played the annoying Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse's ass when he was on the screen. For six weeks, this less-than-dynamic duo is charged on the landscape, foiling prisoner grounds to solve races, usually by the same methods - extortion, kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire Television threw money on the show but to no avail. Violent, sexist, long-term and repetitive, it was quickly cut off to the Knocker's yard.
