This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. She remembered each line and delivered everyone without a bit of natural emotion. She also has a most eerie lash, and her voice tone sounds like nails on the board. This movie has WAY too much Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant who carried the little one left by the movie alone.
