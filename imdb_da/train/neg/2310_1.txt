This was a really opaque film. The performances are triple, and the dialogue is so stolen that it sometimes seemed to be just rolled and dead. My reason for renting this was simple: Find a movie with scriptwriting. I needed a visual aid for my presentation so I figured why not use a clip? Boy was I wrong. After searching for my local video store I came across this, where it was suspiciously titled "Starstruck". I thought, "Hey," and decided to try it. Now I was very dissatisfied with my results. There might have been a scene I could use, and in the meantime I almost fell asleep because of the girl's sheer banality. So ..... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood. There is a movie I can use as an example. Then again something would be presentable to the drive that is "Starfucker".
