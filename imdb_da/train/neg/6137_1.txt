Whew. What can you say about Gymkata who doesn't already have? This is nothing more than pure halarity from the beginning to the end. If you want a movie that keeps you on the floor laughing, it's the perfect movie to get. From Cabot's wild-style mole / sweater combo to Parmistan (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), all about this movie series of crap. Directed by Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene of Bruce Lee's Game of Death, he once again shows his complete lack of talent. A few other faces you probably won't recognize will also be shown to your enjoyment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, even though you can't remember them or worry about them when the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Probably based on a book called "The Terrible Game" which, if I could find a single trace of its existence anywhere, I would be interested in reading it to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book is apparently a figure of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse made to sell its lame idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this one and Yakmallah it yourself. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and it says a little.
