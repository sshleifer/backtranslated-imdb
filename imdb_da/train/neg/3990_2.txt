Jungle Fever is for highly stylized, stereotyped, and comes across as essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong and got no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. While there is plenty of talent in this movie, it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to slightly more than decorative cameos. Also, instead of just showing racism to the ugly and stupid thing, it is that Spike Lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most striking and annoying way. I made it through most of the movie, but I couldn't quite finish it and it rarely seems to me.
