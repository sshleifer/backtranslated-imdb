A horrible movie that features a beautiful D-list Canadian actor who seems so self-confident that they are on camera that their performances are too melodramatic and completely forgettable. This movie is poorly written, poorly edited and badly edited. It is uneven, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he gets, but is the only one in this movie to do it - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It's not even camp enough to be fun. I have not yet seen Van Pelleske act in a credible way, and even the subtitles like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are in a lot in Toronto rather than on a pram off Africa. <br /> <br /> Didn't the instructor find that the "creature" looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? Of course, the battle between the blind blind bolts and Pelleskes orange wisps of 'magic' (! For missing a better word) is the result of bad actors without a choreographer overlaid with completely derived special effects. Was there even a director on the set or in the editing room for this disaster movie (not the good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from others' mistakes ... don't even waste your time with this, you'll regret it as I did. I have nothing more to say about this celluloid waste.
