I caught this movie on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good movie, a Japanese "Green Card". I can't say I never like an Asian movie, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror movies at all times are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a big fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movie. I'm not unlucky for a light hearted movie, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I liked it here. Well, I'd rather split my wrists and drink my own blood than see this discerning, poorly recorded movie ever again. <br /> <br /> I think director Steven Okazaki should have spewed the water with Quaalude because no one in this movie had a personality. And when any of the characters tried to act, as opposed to muttering a line or two, their performance came as forced and incredibly false. I honestly didn't think anyone had ever acted before ... the only one who was genuine was Brenda Aoki. I find it great that this is promoted as a comedy because I don't laugh once. Even more surprising is that CBS morning news called this "a refreshing breath". It was neither refreshing nor comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think of such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wood plays. In fact, I think the "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better movie than this ... and I went out halfway through that movie!
