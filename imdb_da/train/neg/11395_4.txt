Not exactly a new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a drop dead beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other. Although both are promised to others ... oddly enough, they still feel that their soul family is out there somewhere. A little sappy in some places, but viva la love. Being romantic, I am almost bound to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow is falling. The final is almost too sweet, but most deserved. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in hell could not be beaten by Beckinsale. Remarkable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is quirky and fun. See this with your soul collector.
