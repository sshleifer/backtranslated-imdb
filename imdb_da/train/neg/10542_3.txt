Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom the psychic extraordinary Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him intercept, has been resurrected with the First Power (given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber) and may possess the weak bodies. Somehow, Russell, who joins Tess (who has an understanding of what they oppose), will have to stop Channing, or many women will continue to die by their bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen), who has tried to inform her superiors in the First Man's Catholic Church, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing. A cross with a leaf that can penetrate into the heart of Channing clears the world of its evil. She takes it anyway and lends a helping hand to Russell, who will need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess prepares her for a kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable successful supporting actor, partner to the Russell role..so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he tries to kill Channing, he just kills the weak host of another bad soul he possesses. <br /> <br /> Pure occult nonsense. gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I give it to them, but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance. Kober, which is usually always effective as the heavy one, is really more than a greasy villain who jumps in the air and throws rat quips.
