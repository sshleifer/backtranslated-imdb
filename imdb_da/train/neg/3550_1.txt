I run a group to stop comedy exploitation, and I've just used the last 2 months of hearing horror stories from comedians trying to audition for "Last Comic Standing." If they do not have a good agent, they do not even get a chance to audition, so more than 80% of the comedians turning up are rejected before they can show someone that they have talent! If they make it an audition, I was told that it is "predetermined" if they get a second chance. So what the television audience sees is not the best comics in the US. <br /> <br /> If the comics make it to the show, most of them don't get IMDb credits. I know because I made the credits for all 6 seasons, "Last Comic Standing" and I'm not paid to do the Producers' job. It's really a disgrace. A month ago, I asked, "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why manufacturers do not give IMDb credits and I was banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I don't have a personal interest in this. I just want people to know the truth. I don't like to see anyone being exploited, and so I've helped comedians. Comedians are exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a big three network, so those responsible should be ashamed of themselves to let this exploitation happen. <br /> <br /> Please see this video of a comedian who became the victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
