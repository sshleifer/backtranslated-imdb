Well, should start? This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever paid good money to see. I don't want to comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. Initially, the actor, apart from Eric Bana, is a soap opera quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor at The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame. The camera's action also does not help. How it hangs on him when he thinks it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he desperately needs one. In any way, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish my comments, Diane Kruger is a sweet girl, but she's sure no one is Helen of Troy. Peterson would rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role as Elizabeth Taylor would be a little overlooked now.
