Fortunately, I didn't pay to watch this movie. Also, I can't even reveal any spoilers because I willingly went out after forty minutes of the movie. It was so bad. I laughed once when Yahoo! Billboard fell on the guy and the theme song came on. But it was only because I thought it was fun of it, but then I realized that it was still another product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the comic. I used to see it almost religiously. (although I missed the last episode. I heard they showed Dr. Claw and it was no more than a Claw, someone commented on the show's side) The sign had Penny and Brain much more than the movie had to that point. I hated the setup of everything, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of the Inspector Gadget. He's not nearly as lumpy as the cartoon was. Another fact is that his gadgets actually work to the point I saw, except for the oil grinding. He also screwed the tone of "Wowsers", which used to be in an excited tone. I felt so disappointed that they made so many signs of the comic. Everyone else felt it too. We 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon lovingly, and we loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I went into the movie with an open mind and knew they would have screwed up with the comic. I was surprised at how retarded the movie was. It was on synagogues and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie together. Product placement is meaningless in this movie, and it shows. The clever crackling car is not so good at breaking wise. The gadgets look good, but they were almost too blank. The cartoon was a better look. The stupid scenes were crap. For 40-45 minutes, I watched the movie, no laughing, and they laughed at Dudley-Do-Right. This movie should not be monitored by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I highly recommend "The Iron Giant" which was sad but very very good. This movie is a travesty for the whole family drama .------------ 1
