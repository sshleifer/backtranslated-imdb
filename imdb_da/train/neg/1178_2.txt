Totally ridiculous "period" films are just a thin excuse for his extensive graphic depiction of the heroines' affair with the "beast", a monster apparently appearing every century to rape some women. It's pretty much what he does, and the film's depiction of the animal is really really awful; It is basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a large PVC tube for a hard one that flushes abundant amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I might think this is a real fit. However, I was amused at the opening of sex horses in a public space.
