When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - about another installment teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And it's generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the casting of the movie was horrible. You feel no sympathy (or, for that matter, any morbid feeling) for the characters. The action was so horrible that I simply waited and hoped for the God-fearing thing to end. <br /> <br /> Second, there are points in the movie that absolutely had no relation to the plot. Can anyone please explain to me why the smiling boy starts screaming "PANKAKER !!!" At the top of his lungs, while walking into Jackie Chan's movements, have I never seen before and even the guy who has the virus bites? Why does the baby's father continue to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and complete dissatisfaction that I literally said loudly, "How the hell did it come from?" <br /> <br /> I simply couldn't believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me puke and looked puke again. Then blow my brains out. <br /> <br /> Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Seeing grass grow is perhaps a real alternative.
