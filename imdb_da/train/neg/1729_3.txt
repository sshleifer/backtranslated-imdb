... and how they drill you right out of your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies from the 70's, made with no actors of any tone, an embarrassing script, confusing direction and a tireless desire to melt "horror" with light comedy. This movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of a water dynosaur under Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants of Crater Lake. The whole thing is taken care of by Steve our local sheriff. Much of the film - when we do not show blood powder left by what we imagine must have been the animal's dining room - is used after the two guys named Arnie and Mitch, who run a boat rental place. They try so badly to be funny that we get lines like looking at a company sign, Mitch says to Arnie "You spelled bait wrong, it's spelled B-A-T-E." The laughter was pretty scarce here. We then see them being full together and imagining a tree trunk to be the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy are watching! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. And at least the lake is beautiful.
