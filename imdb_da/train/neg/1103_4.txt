As a young black / latina woman, I always look for movies that represent experiences and lives for people like me. Of course when I watched this movie in the video store I thought I'd enjoy it; unfortunately I did not. Although the topics in the film are interesting and relevant, the story is simply not properly developed. The movie continued to drag on and off, and many of the characters displayed on the screen just come and go without contributing to the parent movie. Had the instructor done a better job with the scenes, maybe I would have had a little more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" over this any day. I was just not that impressed.
