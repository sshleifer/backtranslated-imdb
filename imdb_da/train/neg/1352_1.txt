Eytan Fox, who generally leaned on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful movie "Yossi & Jagger". In "The Bubble", however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from giving this movie a standing ovation, the people on the screen I attended quietly stood up and went. I also left quiet and rowing with such a ridiculously unilateral film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying and racist bullying (and terrorism) as an outbreak of justified anger. which means that the Arabs are so aggrieved by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them and that they should therefore not be held accountable for their actions. <br /> <br /> This movie was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (in fact, I considered demanding my money back) and was basically an Israeli apeing of the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israel so watch this movie at all as it really justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a screaming shame. In fact, how Israel can be surprised to be considered a pariah state when the Israelis themselves do such anti-Israel propaganda, begging faith. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, horrible little movie!
