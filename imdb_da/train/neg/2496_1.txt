I would list this movie during the horror movie genre. I did it because I am not aware of a genre called horrible. Since the horror genre comes closest to horrible I have decided to put it in this category. The actor was amateurish. You know who the bad guys would be on the first scene. Heroine is as ugly as the movie. Film production students should take this film as an example to the lesson what not to do in a movie. It's so bad. The man word bad is an understatement. The villains capsize an ocean liner and will have $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered on a inhabited Rose Island in the middle of the Pacific. They wanted to sit ducks after they got the money. There is no escape plan. How stupid. The female cruise director is a former policeman, navy seal, kung fu I'm afraid. The hilarious part is the way the time bomb is damaged. He says he knows what he's doing and he keeps pulling all the wires one by one. He then puts it in his pocket and according to the film with all the connections in place. Is he angry? Who mad us saw this RIDICULOUS. If you have an M-i-L that you don't like. To annoy her rent this movie and pretend to enjoy it. I assure you that she will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son / daughter has married a person under her family standard.
