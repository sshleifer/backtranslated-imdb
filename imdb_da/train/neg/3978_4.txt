When in Rome is a definite improvement on getting there. Getting there I found too predictable, constructed and slow, and to this day I regard it as the Olsen twins worst. But while in Rome is not a horrible movie, it's not a big one either. If I had to sum it up with one word, I would say passable. It's fun for teens, but I think adults don't find much to continue. <br /> <br /> When you have good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually pretty decent actresses, certainly also very beautiful. I will admit when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and generally I still like them. And I've enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back on target, both girls do not make a bad job, they are actually very appealing. Plus their outfits are to die for, and the scenery in Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is also not half bad. <br /> <br /> But where the movie is brought down, it's in the plot and script. The script is mostly klich√©d and has hints about deja vu. The reason that most of Mary Kate and the Ashley movies are very predictable and anyone familiar with some of the Olsen twins' work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it. Most signs are cardboard thin, and you don't learn much about them, and at times the pace is uneven. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery has been spoiled with quite a slapdash camera work that looked constant. <br /> <br /> All in all, its good points and certainly tough. But for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage flu. 4/10 Bethany Cox
