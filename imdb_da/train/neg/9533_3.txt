A text prologue warns us that we must not allow evil to enter our house, but I think the more apt is "entropy". Good grief, what beats these two babes are! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon, while his wife and children are away in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on his door and ask roads. Now it is raining, and they shake like two watery pitiful kittens, and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and what about a thing and another urging George to come in and take part in his pizza by the fire. All three are conducted in Georges bathing trunk, and approximately five minutes follow most undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodecouple exposure. They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls serve him breakfast. But something has become a little combed, because Georgie's guests are gobbling everything with their fingers and pouring ketchup and syrup over the entire linen and - "You eat like animals!" Exclaims George and tells them to come out. In their dreams. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinarily beautiful young blonde with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp jumping around like a superball. You have to say that they breed them very sweet down there in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they breed them with glands that we can't help but notice after the first five or ten minutes. /> <br /> But when the girls go crazy, do the movie. The film is then bathed in a green green light. The couple put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces in themselves in the mirror. They brains a delivery boy and then drowns him to secure himself. They cuss a storm and smash windows and furniture. They have one of the scenes where two people sit over the table apart, lick food and jump each other's bones. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? They first make Georgie unconscious with mace (which contains nothing that you can't find in the little red bottle of McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet), tie him up, pour flour and milk over him, subject him to a psychotic test, put him through one of the Tolstoy-type half-shreds, slamming him around, dressing in foreign costumes and then boasting on him and his almost destroyed upper-middle class home and shipped by a delivery trolley ex machina. <br /> <br /> As for the play, it is as if someone had told Georgie: "First, be polite to these girls, then panic after you are bound." And to the girls: "First action is shy, unwilling to impose someone, so be crazy." And that's it. <br /> <br /> The photography and location work is straight out of a movie from the 1970s. I'm not sure to suggest a total lack of skills. Turning San Francisco into a bad state requires strength and talent. The result gives us two Leitmotivs. Georgies are some pop songs with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in". Jackson and Donna are a catchy rinky-tink thing called "My Good Old Father." <br /> <br /> I approve of the moral lesson behind the story. There are some things you simply shouldn't give in to, even though they may look like a lot of fun at first. All very educational.
