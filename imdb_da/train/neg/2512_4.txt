Tim Robbins is strangely benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in the 1950s New Jersey, falling in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Even though he is a lot on the screen, Robbins interrupts the inner functions of his intense people and falls into the background (it is easy to forget that he is in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, being Walter Matthau who plays Einstein (who does what he can with a comic-designed character). Otherwise, it is sugar and the sunshine, directed rather deaf by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart, but no jokes or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual beloved self, and chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like a loving sister and her big brother. ** from ****
