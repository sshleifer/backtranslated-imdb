It's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my charts. It's by far the number one worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I ever been bored before (fortunately not for more than 1.5 hours), pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature is not even close to getting, but one of my heights are slightly tilted. After the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least a little better. You hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The movie has no story to tell at all and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by some miracles, all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever, and Trent Harris never puts his hands on a camera again ...
