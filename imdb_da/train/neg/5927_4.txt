I am very politically correct guy, so when I say sexistically, I really think it reduced the female guest leader, dr. Miranda Jones, played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all his supposed brilliance and self-control to nothing more inside, but a great, jealous unreasonable baby. You now pursued the plot after her technical sidekick Marvik, also a spurned lover, flips out when he tried to kill Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, out of a jealous rage, but first glanced at it instead. (You think he could just go into the room with his eyes closed and phased in the box, too easily) he takes the business to an un-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could dampen him. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at that time they could have gone to the good lady doctor's art and discuss it. "Spock has to make a mind with Medusan so we can come home. I think we'd like to quit until we run out of supplies and die?" But the lady in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monster who whines and wails when the idea is broached, even when her medusan idol told her to stop and go with them. So dressing up brave fairs with the reported Spock makes him forget to put on his visor that makes Spock go crazy. Kirk, of course, found out what a total twit she was and was ashamed to fix Spock with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, Lady and Medusan leave at the end and everything is forgiven. You almost want the president of Battle Star Galactica turned out to devour the witch out of an airlock for her devastating stunt. But in Star Trek country, ladies are allowed to be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time it is apparently sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
