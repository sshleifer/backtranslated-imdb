OK when I looked carefully at this movie, I thought it looked really scary and was very excited to see it as the group I was with. Now in America especially during this election I see some very deceptive things, but I have to say that these previews were at the top of the list. I can't see how many people could be afraid of this movie. I only noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. The whole movie was highly predictable, and perhaps I destroyed some of the jumping scenes for me. As far as the sound effects so many are so scared, I thought they were comical at best. Oh and uh, katboy, where did it come and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird moan. How does it scare anyone? I can easily make that noise. Now you don't get me wrong I always loved all the really bad scary movies that you just laugh all the way through, but I didn't even think that one had to go for it, it was just plain bad.
