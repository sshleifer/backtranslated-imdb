To be a slasher movie aficionado, I will typically try to see every slash movie that passes over my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good for my brain, I say. While the channel is surfing the second night, Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me. Of course I would check it out as I had heard about the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but have never seen any of them (for shame I know). I would note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I believe is wrong with it is entirely intended by the franchise's own design. <br /> <br /> Now I'm assuming Sleepaway Camp's franchise itself is a joke. Hell, even the name comes as an intentional joke. Sleeping away camp? It is fun. I can appreciate the movie because I just want to put something for pure camp horror value, but it's about as far as I can go. The action of this film made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look as thespians make a representation of Macbeth. Campy requires bad action, but come back. Pamela Springsteen, as the evil outside touch with reality, did a better job of killing my interest than killing the whole cast. What comedy goes by was a couple of times when I chuckled, but it was few and far between. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, SAC II is quite boring and I really wanted to sleep in the camp. The deaths are so clearly staged and false that you can hardly appreciate them. If you're looking for a slasher movie comedy with good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing takes you over this, check and see what's more.
