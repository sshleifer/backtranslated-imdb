OK, don't let my summary fool you. This movie SUGGES HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was horrible in ways people don't have to brace their minds to describe. But it is by no means worse than manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, spider islanders pointed or a small handful of film. As a review, the movie is naughty, it's terrible. Don't see it without MST, or you can develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
