Typical formal action movie: A good policeman is rooted in a mess of crooked police and Japanese gangsters. The right result has decent performances, a few fleeting snicker-inducing moments and some fair action sequences - plus a chance to check out the beautiful Danielle Harris - making the most of her eternal typecasting as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****.
