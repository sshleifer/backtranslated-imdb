A perfect little cruelty ... I doubt if a single shot lasted for more than reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds. Scary exhaust, worse than in Kusminsky's version (a reminder: he managed to misunderstand Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But hey-the rich got what they deserved. Dark and fiery Heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden-locked angel, weak and Anglican Catherine presented as a shabby, melon chest cheering, gentle and weak Linton is a blank, and innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle-Gellar's character from cruel intentions. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners take notice. This thing was made for you. It's an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you; You are rescued from the unpleasant necessity that you are not even trying to understand the complexity of the character, but even from the first shock of their actions. The actors tried, but as previously mentioned, they were miscasted. Decent photography, but editing is at the level of television production class in high school. I ask you all: read the book or the rocks themselves; see the previous versions of it, even Kusminsky's; But stay away from the many future reruns where you will not benefit from the commercial free premiere.
