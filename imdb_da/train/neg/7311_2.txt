Okay, I had heard a little about this movie, so when it came to the movie channels on TV, I'd see it be a horror aficionado. I think I can make a collective "huh?" for anyone who looked at it. <br /> <br /> I decided to move on with my life, but at a party with my closest friends we saw that it was coming, and some of us had already decided we could laugh our way through it , we both proclaim "this is the stupid thing I've ever seen". It wasn't scary; I give it to Roth (which I think is a young hack); characters change throughout the movie, ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> But despite your typical "rats in a cage" scenario - who's turning on who etc, it was pretty average horror. <br /> <br /> A few points: 1.) What was with that child? I'm not even talking about being strange and biting. I'm talking about the whole "slow motion karate kicking", what was that? 2.) Okay, I know that Rider's personality resembled Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman I was shocked that he just went ahead and crumbled her in his sleep. Uh, it's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie, just as Roth could be in the movie. Talk about unwittingly writing yourself! 4.) What was with the substitute? 5.) Then was she immediately pulled apart by the dog? And there was little or no blood left? Just a scrap of her jeans? Anyway we LOVED our asses off, and I love to laugh under horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I don't know if we should laugh here ...
