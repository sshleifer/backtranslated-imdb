In fact, Marc Blitzstein's off-Broadway adaptation of "Threepenny" was not as "bowled" as generally assumed. <br /> <br /> (I'm particularly interested in "Threepenny", my dad was part of the first full production in the US, U in the Illlinois Theater Guild did it around the end of World War II. HJitler had been so close to suppressing the game, they had to reconstruct the manuscript and score from recordings in two different languages ​​{neither English}, a German prompts script and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not a "translation" - fully approved by Lotte Lenya - was much closer to the original than generally believed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version most people know is the MGM cast recording (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur {like Lucy, the "big complete girl" and can don't see the hands of the hips and shoulders thrown back on that line - Bea was a big kid in the fifties, Paul Dooley and John Astin) were heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I believe that 17 (I believe it var) "Goddamn" has been cut to just "damn". <br /> <br /> (At some point, MGM also offered a 2-LP set of * full * game, no doubt as highly censored.)
