An elderly man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse, which seems to be withered. He is driven by it or bitten by something on it. He quickly becomes ill, and in the hospital spits a large swirling white larva of some sort. A later attempt to revive him with paddle results in a splatter of blood. <br /> <br /> A policeman is in the hospital because his partner was badly injured in a shoot-out. Somehow, the police are mated with one of the female doctors and an entomologist who is brought in. There are several young children wandering around in the hospital, which I suppose we should find lovely, but who is extremely annoying little bitches. They happen to walk into the room where the test is held and accidentally dump a growth hormone on it. Horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they are never even in danger. <br /> <br /> The critic grows and starts breeding. People run away from it, and sometimes against it for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by military who are willing to destroy everything if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really convincing characters in the movie, and most people seem to be looking around for the monster. It was pretty boring. It clearly owes something to the foreign films, with the monster born inside a human being and with several stages of its growth. There is also a character called Bishop, and the leading actress has Sigourney Weaver hair.
