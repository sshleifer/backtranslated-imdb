When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. So I had to see the darn thing. I love M. C. Beaton's books on the wonderful Scottish constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well written. The powers responsible for this mish-mash have apparently never read one of the Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensive. It seems that the actors feel they have to shout their lines and scream at each other. If you love M. C. Beaton's sweet Hamish Macbeth don't waste your time on this nonsense.
