OK first and foremost, the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s. I was shocked to find out that it was released in 2001. Next, the plot was everywhere, just outside the bats story is confusing. Had there been any short prologue or introduction, history would have been better. I also appreciate imagination, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and poorly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the signs were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation, but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I'd recommend Promise (visually stunning, plot is interesting and good character development) not this movie. Make sure you are disappointed.
