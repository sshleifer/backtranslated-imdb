Jesus Christ, I can't believe I've been wasting my time watching this movie. I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost put me off her. This is absolutely terrible! I could have seen Survivor Series 93 over this. <br /> <br /> The leading guy in this was so bland and generic. I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove '91 had his ass through a glass window. I was disgusting every time he said "lake" and "cabin". I would kick his ass. <br /> <br /> By contrast, Jordan Ladd was amazing. A true angel. But she couldn't even save this lovely joke from a movie. Unfortunately, she couldn't even act like she was away from her nut when she took the truth medicine. It looked fun. <br /> <br /> I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a time when ... never reminded. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because of the horror.
