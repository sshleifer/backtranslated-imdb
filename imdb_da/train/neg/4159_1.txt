In this weirdly defective apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this Grade-Z movie reminiscent of Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe . Bored worker still runs petrol stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still appear with radiator fluid just when you need it. The reason, and I use this term loosely, involves a father and daughter trying to rendevous with "the general" whose daughter is missing in a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to travel with the father and daughter. I have to admit that for a moment or two real humor can be found between great stretches of accidental humor. The film also has just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. Any older person beware.
