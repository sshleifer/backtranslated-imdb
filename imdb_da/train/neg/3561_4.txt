Stephen King adaptation (written by King himself), where a young family, newcomers to rural Maine, find out the pet's cemetery close to their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out of the Micmac burial ground beyond the cat cemetery that has resurrection powers - only of course, something is buried that comes back not quite right. <p> <p> Below the average "horror" image begins clumsy, insulting and unobtrusive and continues in that way for some time, with the worst element being Midkiff's worthless performance. It gets a little better towards the end, with really disruptive finals. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, so I can't completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable. Fred Gwynne's decent entertainment performance, like the wise old age, and Brad Greenquist, as the devious spirit of Victor Pascow, is not enough to really redeem movies. King has his usual cameo as minister. <p> <p> Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it weird that she hasn't had any regular film work since?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
