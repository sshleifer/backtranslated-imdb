After Highlander 2 (which I'm still in denial), I thought was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was mistaken. I loved the original Wargames, but this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames had at least some hackers working. The one who wrote this movie did not know anything about computers except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even saw the original movie. The action is not even convincing. Please save yourself, under no circumstances see this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn off the TV. THIS MOVIE SHOOTS YOUR LIFE.
