Okay, I'm not serious about anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, the Power Rangers have been at the bottom of this list. Can you think of anything more stupid than five and six teens (who don't even seem like a normal teenager) dances in identical suits of different colors so you can tell them? Fans, have you ever been across a real person who is being thrown against a mental wall and standing up almost immediately and continuing to struggle without being hurt? The Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys, and believe me, I've never seen this show, even though I was five. I think you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. The teenagers actually act as teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually seems like a mentor or not, a teacher. It has a teen humor, even though the games are paralyzed, I don't hate Dino Thunder. Many say the Power Rangers are shit, but I wouldn't. It would be an insult to crap. Then face it, five-year-old boys, the Power Rangers are nonsense.
