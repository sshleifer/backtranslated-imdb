I won't waste my time writing an essay and wasting your time. However, I would like to say that all those who are engaged in this film themselves are made ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can't play that card and I mean nationalist patriotic card to make people not see this movie. this is a film that expresses its free will in this country (oh yes i played it briefly), although the director is German and deserves a pat on the wrist every time he reaches a camera, but the world is full of controversy and it is The same thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, laughing and being disgusted, not disgusted, its dark humor and of course you don't have the heart to take it, the past is over, yes people remember those who lost, but it was time to move on was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides, I'm crazy and who needs a soul?
