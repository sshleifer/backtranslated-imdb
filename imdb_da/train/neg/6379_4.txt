With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space", how could you go wrong? Just throw some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use Village People as the main vendors for the soundtrack and throw in tons of gay people. The reason is insignificant. Too bad, this movie doesn't contain any of this, and every joke misses the place. The signs all look from the German gay nigger, one or two jokes, the rest failing. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was willing to laugh even more about the movie. My expectation was too high apparently.
