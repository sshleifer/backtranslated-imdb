When this film was released in 1997, they were "special effects" like the poor. They would have been dated even in the 1980s, and even some films produced in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better SFX work. Absolutely no one involved in the production of this movie was looking for an Oscar. It's a wild departure from director Fred Olen Ray's usual stuff, most of whom have the word "Bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from Lost Planet, etc.) And are a little more than T&A flicks, but here we are with a film-qualified "U" and targeted the kiddies. You need to give him credit to diversify !! This was a lesser direct-to-video cult hit, which later resulted in a few successors - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career went downhill soon after the 1982s "ET) plays the movie's" invisible mother "and will return to the sequel Russ Tamblyn (whose career had been freely dropping even further since the 1961s" West Side Story ") plays the scruffy Dr. Woorter, it is probably fair to say that most of the cast was at the time of their career, where they would be ready to work on just about anything to just pay the bills that month - Except perhaps young Trenton Knight as Josh, it admits that even though he worked ahead of this movie, this actress did not work again after the sequel "Invisible Mom 2", perhaps the movie was cursed. "For a children's actor, he is pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-stars. As mentioned above, the" invisibility "effects are easiest to say the least, the direction is bad, the writing is obvious and has nothing to write home about. There are lots of videos out there, though, and for anyone under the age of ten, this movie will no doubt be completely visible. Most adults are likely to do a vanishing act of their own while on and I would not blame them a bit!
