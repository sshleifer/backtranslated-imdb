When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to look at her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more vicious than "natural causes". The closer she comes to the truth, the more a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line) and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do everything necessary to stop her nosy ways. <br /> <br /> If you're into sleazy, satanic-themed movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The film is filled with lots of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. A special scene with a young woman and a goat should be seen as believed. Unfortunately, all sleaze in the world cannot save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total drilling. Apart from the one scene I have already mentioned, the many sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. The action is spotty at best. Even the genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The reason doesn't matter. The main function seems to be keeping the twist of boring sex scenes together. I'm only familiar with another movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his daughters of darkness who masterfully mix eroticism and horror, Black Candles comes out as amateur. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
