Gayniggers from outer space are largely summed up by its name. Running only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of gay blacks coming to Earth to release the men from women. Although I see a small significance for the plot, it is also really illogical. Granted, it was supposed to be a comedy / spoof on society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so it succeeded. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. As the spaceship floats on the ground, you can see stars zooming for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown in the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors are not convincing, the characters are messed up; In general, the whole thing does not take itself seriously. If you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it's very accessible and easy to see through to the end. Some parts are fun. But overall, the only thing you are left to remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever. See that it's a short film and has some fun aspects, it's not the worst to see. But it is illogical and has little long-term value. I can't really recommend it; If you see it, do it for the unique concept, not the quality.
