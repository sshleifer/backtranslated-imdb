Do not want to. A little prosciutto could go a long way, but everything we get is pure ham, especially from the Dunaway. The reason is one of those bumper car episodes ... the vehicle jumps into another, and everything changes direction again until we just scratch our heads and wonder if there was ever a plot. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play across from a mystified Dunaway playing Lady Macbeth lost in Marx Broder's Duck Soup. Ah, Raven ... now there's an actor. And there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread filled with lots of gloom and no working methods. I'm one of those suckers who just have to watch a movie at the end. Quoth the Ravens, "Nevermore."
