Acts are terrible. This film makes Fast and Furious look like an academically award winning film. They throw a few breasts and bumps in there to try to keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far-fetched history. There is a reason why people on the Internet do not even download this movie. This film sank like an iron dryer. Don't waste your time renting or even downloading it. This movie is and will always be a PERMA-TURD. I'm now stupid to have seen it. In fact, this title should be called "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling it a movie is a travesty and insult. disgusting, horrible, horrible, awful, covetous, cruel, abominable, unpleasant, disgusting, horrible, scary, frightening, fairy, horrible, scary, horrible, awful, grisly, cruel, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrid, shabby, miserable, horrible, horrid, shabby, miserable, unclear
