I rented this movie on Netflix after it won all the Oscar's to see if it was so good. Hurt Locker is a very realistic depiction (mostly) of a group of soldiers' rotation in Iraq. The film is centered on Will James, a ruthless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks and mitigating bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this movie seems to be missing in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie. This movie has no clear plot unlike other movies like Black Hawk Down. What this film is trying to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes to the war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be drawing. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but it feels like a 3-hour movie. A scene in the movie that was particularly horrible and destroyed the film's perfect credibility was the sniping scene halfway through the movie. It was both unrealistic and very far. Overall, I thought this movie was OK, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a big disappointment to win Best Picture at the Oscar. I felt that this movie could have been so much better considering saving private Ryan lost best picture but was much better than this movie. Another notable mention is the Black Hawk Down, which only won 2 Oscars. I honestly don't know how this won best picture. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action-packed war girl, hire Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
