This is a bad movie. Not one of the funny bad ones either. This is a miserable bad. It was actually painful to see. The direction was horrible, with lots of jumping around, and the green and yellow shades used throughout the film make the characters sick. Keira Knightly was not at all convincing as a tough chick, and I can't believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke have been signed for this criminal celluloid waste. The script was horrible, and the play was like nails across a blackboard. If you haven't seen it, don't. You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours in your life and look at this drive. I've seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them because of their mistakes. This one is just a waste of time.
