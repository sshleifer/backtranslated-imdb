Men in black 2 were a real disappointment to me. While the actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, it's just not a cure for a poor script that is once in production. The movie really had a "sequel" kind of feeling, and played partial events of the first movie. The story was in a word ... bad at best. It wasn't well thought out, and sometimes seemed very choppy and incoherent. <br /> <br /> In the first flick, the MIB organization had a kind of "elite" sense of strength. You had some special agents and it had a "secret" kind of feel to it. In the successor, the MIB organization has a JROTC Summer Camp vibe. <br /> <br /> The movie was not horrible or anything .. it just lacked "coolness" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first movie. A lot of the same old humor was reused from first to second and did not really add originality to the MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 for the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worth wearing that title? Not really.
