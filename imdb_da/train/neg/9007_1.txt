This movie is some of the worst crap I've ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head as I watched this movie. CGI was terrible and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr. Super-Intuitive-I-Can-figure-out, unless he doesn't seem to work his own helicopter properly. The biggest problem was the split screen camera work. I felt like I was looking at Brady Bunch or something, only it wasn't different people in the boxes, just close-ups and different views of the same. I can only count on the actors really needed the money because this movie was not the host of the movie it was shot at.
