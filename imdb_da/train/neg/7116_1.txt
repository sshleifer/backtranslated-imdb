* WARNING * Possible spoiler under <br /> <br /> The movie is more boring than anything else. There seems to be no attempt to build tension through poorly lit shots of empty spaces and empty lawns, but none of it works. <br /> <br /> MST3K did a pretty good job with it, but in itself the movie is the most fun. <br /> <br /> Funny moments: <br /> <br /> When the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes, wife gets hysterical and woozy while the man (who is trying to drive a wife crazy) says in a deadpan vote "There is no skull there, there is no skull." <br /> <br /> When the real ghost shells have the man caught in a pickle, as if caught between the first and second base.
