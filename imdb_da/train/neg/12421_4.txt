Mark Pirros' "Deathrow Gameshow" from 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts, but sometimes very fun anyway. This movie might have been much better, the play is terrible, and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to see at times, but the concept is fun and it has some hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (year 1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) is hosting a game show called "Live or Die", where doomed prisoners of death have the chance to play for their lives and for money. Failure candidates are executed in the air by a variety of methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other more bizarre execution units, followed by applause from the enchanting studio audience. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made lots of enemies ... "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects, and the play is terrible, but it is undoubtedly fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. You haven't missed anything if you haven't seen it, but it's definitely fun and a good time. 4.10
