To be honest, this movie is another in a number of major disappointments ... most of these so-called "masters of horror" films are just awful with their underprivileged effects and ridiculous stories ... except Ron Perlman, all others in this movie cannot act to save their lives ... the shot sounded like someone was playing Bop-it under the boom Mike or something, and so totally unrealistic ... in general, this movie is as scary as Home Alone ... they the only good gentlemen are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I don't know how these directors can sleep at night and know they've destroyed the whole genre that some of them used to understand. .
