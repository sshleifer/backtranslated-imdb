This movie looked good - well-cast, evergreen item and an explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why was it filmed with a handheld camera? It shakes, judges, captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A bad choice indeed. As if that were not enough, the worst editing in memory assumes a drug viewer - mandatory if you want it at all. And then it commits the supreme sin. After bringing the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and incredible scenarios to the fatigue point, they rolled credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payout - like what it was the subject of? How can you expect to succeed by making strings without an end? Doh! This film had a big promise and ended up making a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort by author and director.
