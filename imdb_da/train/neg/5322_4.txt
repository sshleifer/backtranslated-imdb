There are two kinds of 1950's musicals. First you have the blank MGM productions with big names and good music. And then you have the smaller league with a less famous cast, less famous music and other rate directors. 'The girl can't help it' belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous, and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, not against. Seems like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Anderson's. The plot itself is thin as a razor blade, and one cannot help suspecting that it is mostly an attempt to sell records to Fats Domino, Little Richard or other 1950's rock actors appearing in the movie. If that music appeals to you, it's worth seeing. If not, don't bother.
