This is the case with a lot of people who think they are so clever, they have a story that fits in with time. Remember the all-round political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to Watergate and a little later? Most movies trying to deposit money on the TV are so powerful, so insane conspiracies were actually caught in their own belly-staring stance. <br /> <br /> I was never a fan of The Konversation, which I find as much dated as other conspiracy traces of time, but Coppola was true to his main character, and Hackman was a rather engaging actor to observe. I think these conspiracy films mostly drown in the character wave of noir heroes. Lots of questions unanswered, lots of dis-communication ... At least it requires at least Bergman to make a movie about such invisible bases. <br /> <br /> Next man is a perfect example of his time: a political soup served with an idealistic character and a terrible conspiracy tightening his web around him. Neither part is interesting in itself and it doesn't get any better. In fact, you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences that catch 'watcha' who murder without speeding up any history. In the worst case, pedestrians direct as most of the movie is a pompous accumulation of scenes about violence naively brought under the eyes of viewers.
