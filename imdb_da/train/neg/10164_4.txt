I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival and can't quite decide it. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them. Perhaps we were all in a "bubble" of ourselves, but these people did not compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fate. At a maturity of just over an hour, the signs were not very well developed. Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the slightly scary baby dolls with surprisingly vivid eyes that most of the signs that were lifetime were somehow more interesting than the living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never came together.
