*** SPOILER *** Don't read this if you are thinking of watching the movie, even if it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The reason is so predictable that it doesn't make any difference if you read this or not anyway) <br /> <br /> If you wonder if you want to see "Coyote Ugly" or not: not! It is also not worth the money for the ticket or VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" you could say. The plot itself is as low as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. The young beautiful girl from a small town will be a great success in New York. They get desperate attempts to give the film some depth errors, such as the fathers' "tragic" accident, the "difficulties" with the Violets relationship with his girlfriend, etc. McNally (Director) is trying to awaken the audience's shame and sadness does not give a chance to succeed in this attempt because of the bad script and the low play. In particular, Piper Perabo completely fails to convince one of "Jersey's" fears of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and pretty funny thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the little ray of hope for this movie. I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First, "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... What happened to big movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? It was true Bruckheimer thing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a superficial movie with beautiful women just to have a relaxed evening, you better go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it is much more fun, entertaining and self-ironic) in instead of this flick. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
