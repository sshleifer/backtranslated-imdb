I note that most of the people who believe this movie speaks the truth either were not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. I think it's much easier to ask questions about a historical event if you didn't live through it. <br /> <br /> I was young at Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on every day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a variety of languages. In school, some classes were canceled, so we could see the most important events on television. Under Apollo 13, the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men returned home to an uncertain fate. You couldn't go anywhere without anyone asking what the last was. The world was really a community. <br /> <br /> Now with a buffer of eighty-eight years after the fact, fraud can easily be invoked because worldwide enthusiasm and interest have died. We are back with our history books, and anyone can claim that the story is wrong and try to "prove" it with a bunch of lies and ready-made facts while completely ignoring the consideration of evidence that shows otherwise - not to mention the evidence for living in souls and recalling those who lived through these wonderfully noisy and amazing days.
