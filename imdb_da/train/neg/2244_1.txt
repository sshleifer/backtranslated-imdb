There are two points I must make clear at the beginning. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscar was, really was all about this year. It was the Academy's way of showing people that they are not racist and have never been. They wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it makes a little pointless to comment on the show, really, what difference will it make? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year I got tired of Oscars! I will never see the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" when the right winners should have been Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it and you agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when released received no nominations. And as far as this year goes, yes, the bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann has no "Best Director" nomination! Are you kidding!! "A Beautiful Mind" is up for "Best Makeup" ???? "Training Day" is nominated ?? The movie was horrible, and it looked like Washington didn't even turn into a show, all he proved was, he knows how to use four letters! That's what h won the prize for! Take away the language and I bet he almost played himself! I liked "Gosford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how could they not give Altman it on earth? I mean if you just give the price to people to remove any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years now and no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscar, but I will live with it as long as I never see another show again! Highpoint (and the only one) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance ever at the show. It will go down as one of the greatest moments in the show's history.
