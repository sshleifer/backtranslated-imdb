We didn't have this on television in England, but I went over the Internet on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into the comic book, but I have to admit it better than this. The comic has not done anything for years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a comeback travesty and an all time low! The story is about three cats that inherit a house and lots of money out of their dead old lady master. They are argumentative and disagree on what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The animation is horrible. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they don't look like cats! Just weird animal-monster creatures with big mouth, pointed teeth and bulgy eyes! The human and other animal characters are also drawn really ugly! The theme song is horrible and annoying! The stories are also paralyzed and most likely copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show got 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. The TV is really not what used to be! But now most of them are stupid, cheaply made and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me, but I'm sorry, but it's a total waste of money and a complete and complete waste of your time and feel happy that Britain doesn't have to endure this crap (oh yes, if you have digital you need to) but I don't, so that's not my problem! Taber! 2/10 (and it is very fortunate to get it because I've given other shows the worst!).
