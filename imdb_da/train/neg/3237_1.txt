Not that I slip myself happily into the eyes of realistic bloodshed, but when I put a DVD in I expect a bloodbath and what I get is a bloody scene (lumpy) in the tail of asinine false slapping and spinning in a desk chair, I end up thinking "yes it's 43 minutes in my life gone forever." I would not consider this or Flower of Meat and Blood "movie" as much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of meat and blood had a few hard spots to look at. The devil's experiment did not. At best, it was stupid and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectation was too high. I think of the DVD "Oh man, it gets sick." After seeing them fake lazy girl about a thousand times I quickly looked it up. <br /> <br /> Two kinds of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People seeking F'd up movies just to see how F'd up it really is, or 2) horror completest. I searched for this and the other guinea-pig movies for the latter reason, but even though I fell into the category of the former, this movie would not float my boat. In fact, I can imagine that this movie increases one's bloodstream ... as in "WILL YOU DRIVE DANISH B * T NEVER !!" In conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for compilation purposes. If you want carnage, the traditional horror does not give, get traces of death. Well, it also sucks, but at least you get the blood and intestines you expect. The only reason I can see for everyone who boasts this shit is because they feel they need to. No artistic merit that I can understand, no reason for it is infamy, nothing nothing. Just a lame attempt to be shocking.
