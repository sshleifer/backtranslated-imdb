In this paranoia-driven potboiler, our reporter hero struggles with fast-paced authorities, duplication, dismissal of UFO debunkers and silent, scary foreigners. (Although it is capable of controlling and zapping objects from afar, it requires three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The script clumps from event to event, giving puzzles abundance. Why did foreigners blow their dog? Why do they release the soldiers with radiation when they only patrol an empty landing site? And what room dudes worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model? Asking Mind Want To Know! Writer Instructor Mario Gariazzo apparently investigated his subject by skimming a stack of UFO-themed tabloids as he took a Healthy Classics double function. (The Final Screen screen boasts that it is based on actual events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned by the sudden finale, but it still needs to appeal to conspiracy battles.
