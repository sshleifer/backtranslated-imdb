Very fun to see "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural garbage game. It is in response to Jess Franko's type b-movie.Bodybuilders turn back (! Face to face!) To pushers. The very very stupid strike! : Incredibly poorly directed shots (scenarios) look even better than hand-to-hand matches. Fighting scenes are ridiculous. Save beauties scenes incredibly stupid.Erotic scenes are very untruthful. Main flight in movies are beautiful landscapes and festival scenes. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the start of the movie and a list of Franco Columbu's chin at the end. Special attraction: naked bosom. Almoust forgot - Franco can sing!
