This effort was like an excellent TV movie ... I don't remember it ever being released in theaters ... If so, it must have died a quick death. Look at the DVD in our bedroom, it was obvious that this movie was meant for not much more ... Ed Lauter an art critic with a greed? What a fun trip that must have been ... I haven't seen Ed since "The Long Yard" ... Everyone else did pretty much the numbers, led by Baldwin, except Pompeo ... She had no charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking through most of the picture ... Pompeo's daughter had a dimension ... she played every scene as a lovable little puppy ... slowest line delivery of a 3 year old I've seen yet ... <chase scenes gave my wife and I headache ... too much quick-cutting and angular-based ... If you have to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you might have a few WIDE shots to take advantage of the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was pretty unlikely and removed, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
