Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also has a sharp dialogue, compelling characters, and an obstructed or rather non-existent story. It lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to push a kind of feeling from a creepy and unpleasant hysteria afest! <br /> <br /> HEDGEHOGEN! How many cheap shots can a movie take? Hedgehog, by the way, gave the most convincing and durable performance in this fifty minute cringe-athon. <br /> <br /> If you have considered watching this movie, don't. I'm sorry, but I can't find a single redemption feature for this movie. It scores a big, fat ZERO with me. Strictly for sub-Dogma knicker-waters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> Still, if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
