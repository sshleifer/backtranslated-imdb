Now I looked at this night, and the only thing that didn't make it terribly terrible is that it was just ahead. There were no battles around the bush that this child was the Antichrist. But the movie was just badly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dental incident an "accident" or ultimately how the policeman just miraculously ended up in the house in time to save the child without the police themselves being called yet. The death scene was just really bad and not entertaining at all. The child they chose to play Anti-Christ was boring, and they could really have chosen a better child. Don't waste your time watching it here.
