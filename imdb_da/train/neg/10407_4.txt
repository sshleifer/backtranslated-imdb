I found Tremors 4: Legend begins to be boring and boring. All action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, if not less. The act was horrible, and this movie was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of how the grassroots were formed, history is so stupid and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story WAY back in time, make sure you use the same actor (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past when he is someone in the present in the other Tremor movies. Geez ... If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time. Stick to Tremors, 1, 2 and 3 for a good time. This movie should make sure you are remotely seated right next to you with the STOP button that works for a quick retreat away from this rubbish.
