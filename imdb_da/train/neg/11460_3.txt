Really entertaining piece that tries to show how smart Orcas is, but in the meantime (and totally unaware of them) the audience is stupid by making the most ridiculous movie. Richard Harris plays Quint. I'm sorry, it's wrong, he plays captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for life, but lures the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale. When catching a female whaling goes wrong (don't ask), it is buddy (don't ask), goes on a rampage (don't ask) and starts STALKING captain Nolan (don't ask). Soon Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (don't ask). Really great filmmaking here guys. I have to tell you, but the beginning (with whale sounds and not much else) is quite exciting, and the final credits (with the most godly song) are quite entertaining.
