This is one of the most boring horror movies I have ever seen, as it is absolutely god horrible, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring and the story is horrible, plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away! The great setting and the creepy house would certainly have helped if it wasn't so boring boring, and there is no sign of mess either, and I hope it makes it to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there after mine opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end, it's a pretty good scene, but it's already too late, and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks, plus the only really bleak scene in the movie is when a character gets its face spoiled by Bee's as it was pretty gory. I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really surpasses in my opinion, plus it is fortunate that this was included in a set I bought otherwise, I would have chucked this out of the window! This is one of the most boring horror movies I have ever seen, as it is absolutely god horrible, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say avoid it like the plague! You will not review the torture. The direction is absolutely horrible! Carl Monson makes a horrible one! Job here, make everything look cheap, waste its potential to make spooky atmosphere and just keep the movie at an incredibly boring pace. The action is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but others are hardly in the movie, other than flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merry Anders overwhelms me terribly as Laura, since she didn't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and a little scary, but also exaggerated, she had an eerie smile at the end though. The rest of the throw, I didn't pay enough attention either, as I had a lot of trouble getting through it, but they were all really bad. Overall, this is avoided, it is not worth the wait! BOMB out of 5
