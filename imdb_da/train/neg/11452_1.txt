If I could have rated this movie with 0 I would have! I see some ppl on IMDb say this is the year's funniest movie etc. Excuse me? are you ppl snorting LSD or ........? There is absolutely no fun about this movie N O T H I N G! I actually want my 27 minutes back in my life that I used to see this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane watching this movie stop looking after 30 minutes, I fully understand that I would actually have seen snakes on a plane twice over instead of watch this movie once! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie, do anything else useful with your life, do the plate, walk the dog, hell ... everything is better than spending time in front of the television watching hot rod.
