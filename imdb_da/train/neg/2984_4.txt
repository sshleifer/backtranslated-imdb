I admit that the majority of this movie was uninspired, but I was still entertained. It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy, above average music, and the women in the film are hard to defend, there is no price here. I can think of dozens of other movies that were much worse, at least this had an exciting plotline along with some social comments. They refer to how the military deals with viral epidemics, destroying everything in sight, even if it means the people you 're going to save. Also, how dangerous the fight can be, as democracy ceases to exist at that time. Fulci seemed to try to combine his previous work (zombie, beyond the gates of hell) in an attempt to somehow improve them. He failed, but certainly not miserably, as a number of people wanted you to think. I have a soft spot for zombie film, so I admit I'm a little biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I say is that this movie is good for sometime, if there was not so much descension in the production of this movie (fulci quit and bruno (I can hack with the best of them) mattei took over) it could have been much better and more focused. It's going to remain in my collection as fulci's zombie swan song. A surprising note is that there is a scene in zombie 3, which the cemetery man actually knocked off, I couldn't believe it myself, check it out, you're surprised.
