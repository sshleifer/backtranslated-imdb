After sitting through this pile of mouth, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. That was the alarmless and formal. But the American propaganda thrown into your face throughout the film shows - disappointingly - that it is human work. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like "We must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it" seem to be ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage tracks lines like "I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a negotiating chip "with a straight face made me and my husband wonder if the whole cast took Valium before they shot every scene. The "reasoning" behind each plot turn and new "clue" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a bonus page plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name was chided by everyone involved for "never closing up." She is clearly in the film for looks only, but they felt the need to beat a "Dr." title of her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, "Should you never stop?" And the camera pans for her look poutily in her hands as if she were a child. Really grotesque. The only advantage of this movie was that it's so amazingly bad that you get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people who saw the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Spooky....
