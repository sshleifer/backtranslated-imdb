Utter drunk. I arrived at 16 minutes / 27 seconds and gave up. I would have given it a negative number revision if possible (though "pissible" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike sizzle, you could see and practically feel between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original. The chemistry between silly ol 'Dicky Crenna and what is here face here is just nonexistent. The anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet? There is no ciggy lighting at your fingertips? And I thought I'd be SIKK when they have a mortified-looking (and rightly you believe me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes almost burping / upchucking way through the explanation of his "little man" to Mr. Garloupis. No offense for the non-sight, but it looks as if a blind man of blind men ran with the designed design of both Dietrichson and Neff houses. The same goes for the terrible plaid pants that Phyllis wears. And crikey, how much $$ does Neff make that he lives overlooking a large marina? This, people again, takes place all in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get through more of it, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. But please take Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop a "little man" of your own who must never go away. Proceed with caution, of course.
