Saw it at the high festival of UCSB and was * shocked * that it won the gold roll prize. I was not the only one when the audience had mixed reactions to the play. I thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily anchored in film theory and other artistic crap. While cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the story is no more than your average student piece. It seems that "serious" student films should include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal, and any suicide - Nick and Kate polish out and include all three. So much more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and that may be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. Does anyone else do that?
