I don't know what it was about this movie that made me react so viscerally to it. Maybe it was the characters that were so unlikely and unconvincing enough to care about. Maybe it was the disorganized story. Maybe it was that Rob Lowe had a long dangly earrings and eyeliner. Maybe it was because at some point in the movie they all break into song. Maybe it was because the 1980s were never the 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a curly hyperball. Perhaps this is because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade. I don't know what made me hate it, but if it means trying to see it again, I'm not willing to figure it out.
