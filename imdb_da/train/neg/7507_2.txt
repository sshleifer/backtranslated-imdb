This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of big name talent that would ever agree to appear in such a junk like this. I imagine there were a couple of stringent agents scattered across Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this failure. What really gets you is that it could have been good. The executives appealed and the topic was sufficient feed to spark interest and ticket sales, but it is a flop. The multiple story lines go from bad to stupid of the pictures, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be messy. What Spike is capable of achieving is vengeance for any Italians who may have beaten him up when he was a child or offended him, as the film makes a large number of persistent obsolete and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are some really thoughtful and magical cameras. He has the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if it is only for some memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you endure the other two main lessons that scratch and watch watch as you wonder and wait for the end to be there somewhere.
