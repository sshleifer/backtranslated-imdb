Terrible ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw some beautiful pictures over the years. The sound sucks, it does the quality of the picture, the direction, the actor, etc. Contract. The only good shots (which are fun because they are so bad) are the special effects. Overall, there are approx. 5 minutes to laugh. The rest of the girl gives you brain damage.
