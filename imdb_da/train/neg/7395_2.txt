As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first job of a young director. My doubts are whether this is a regular guy's work that happens to love movies or if it's a cinema student's work as there is a reference to the Porto Academy of Fine Arts in the final credits. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, director Ricardo Pinho with this movie demonstrates a total ignorance of some basic beliefs about cinema. What is a movie? How do you tell a story? It doesn't matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when studying cinema is how to tell a story. You learn it, like in novels, in movies, you should also construct your story into three actions: the introduction, the evolution and the conclusion. You learn that your story must have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn that this applies to a 3-hour epic, to the regular movie, to a short film and even believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. You also learn that there may be levels of subtlety in your approach to the academic structure, and that in the end you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> In rough terms, TIM WATCHER introduces us its protagonist and then film ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in the Jeu's AMÉLIE. There are no other or third actions in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art movie, so you can't even try to justify respect for the academic structure. You expect to be told a story and it does not happen. Worst than that, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one without real purpose. It doesn't matter, or at least not a valid one. Its point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The depicted situations are quite simple and its approach is maniches. <br /> <br /> I expected much more from this brief. The movie opens with a pretty good credit sequence and you quickly realize that you see something with better production values ​​than the regular Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget for this film, but judging by the bill of thanks in the final credit, profits must go to the production team for such good relations in a country where it is difficult to get doors opened to young filmmakers. <Br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully selected plans combined with a fine score. That's all. There is nothing else. There is no plot. And it's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. You can hardly see in the ordinary Portuguese map such diversity of places and so many available extras to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison sounds, I have to see BMW shorts as a fine example of how to tell a good story in a very short movie that is heavily dependent on product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography.
