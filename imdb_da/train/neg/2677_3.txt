It's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, humor's cheesy, and it's also the actor. But it's a soft core film that is expected and doesn't matter because what you really want is sex. Which makes me the biggest problem for everyone, there's almost nothing of it. Which makes you feel like watching television at 3am, and the independent movies playing and the one on was made by some college kid who doesn't go in that industry. You have a very long time waiting for a real sex scene, many times you think something is going to happen so you just left hanging. One (maybe two, or one with two parts) that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing. I can't personally recommend this unless you found it in a clear bin for a dollar or two. If you succeed in a good movie with a plot and good acting, you will not have it here. If you are looking for a good soft core lesbian movie, you will not have it either.
