This was a complete disappointment. The action is not bad, but the production was just so bad that I sometimes felt I should stop it, but unfortunately I did it and was able to make it a little embarrassed about the bad movie. It is OK. if you are with a cheesy moral plot and does not mind watching a movie that basically misunderstands Whitman. If you want a cheesy fictional story go to it.
