This movie is a calculated attempt to make money in the success of Sex in the City and four weddings and a funeral. In fact, if they had called it Sex at a funeral, they could have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools and can't stand up. The characters exude an unlikely light dialogue, but never function externally recognizable as human. An arbitrary, meaningless act follows another to promote what passes for a plot and a soon-to-be tire of the decay of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points for acting out her little heart, but the executive glory is stolen by Imelda Staunton, as a whole, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms Staunton does not seem unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the author's director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill annoyed you as being false, stay away from it. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.
