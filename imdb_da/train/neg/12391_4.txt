Manipulative drama of a glamorous model (Margaux Hemingway) raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister (played by Mariel's spouse) whose music teacher he is. While the central trial is about attention - thanks to Anne Bancroft as Hemingway's lawyer - the film is too often just blank, but also dramatically convincing: the jury apparently takes the musician's side because a) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b) She did not resist her supposed aggressor when her sister came to the apartment and accidentally mated the bed. What f ***? she was clearly tied up - what resistance could she realistically offer? <br /> <br /> The other half of the film - involving Sarandon's rape of the sister, who curiously expects IRREVERSIBLE (2002) to appear in a tunnel - is quite constructed: Mariel character should have known better than trusting Sarandon after what he did with his sister, but Margaux, of course, repeats the workforce that indirectly led to his humiliating experience almost instantly! However, the Climax - where Sarandon gets its only desserts where Margaux suddenly turns into a fearless and inventive vigilante - is a crowd-pleaser like DEATH WISH (1974); Moreover, ubiquitous Italian filmmog Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. It is worth noting how the lives of the two Hemingway sisters went wildly differently (it was the debut of both films): Margaux's career never took off (despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here) - while Mariel would soon receive one Oscar nomination for Woody Allen's MANHATTAN (1979) and interestingly would even play a glamorous victim of violent violence when he outlined the reality "Playboy" centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse's STAR 80 (1983). With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and eventually died of drug overdose in 1996; chilling, the Hemingway family had a story of suicide - especially the sister's grandfather, celebrated author Ernest, who died of a self-inflicted shooting spring in 1961.
