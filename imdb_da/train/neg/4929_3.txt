The bursts of this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is raped and knocked down at the end. And not a moment too soon. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was afraid I would hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, "The Lost and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton" (I think people didn't "I loved spoilers then") was written by a woman, an English navy abruptly, either anxious or cynical or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter as if Lady Barbara's immediate and only answer when someone gets in the way is murder. She kills three men in five attempts. A serial femme fatale, she has a case of dissociative personality disorder that should have landed her in either Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp that carries so much makeup that I thought of her as a restauration era Joan Rivers (or a restoration era Joan Rivers, ha!). Still, Lady B. is irresistible to all three main characters: Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all of whom do good work, like Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers discover in a short sequence what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in its orbit until one of them finally guns her down - accidentally what is meant to be either irony or just desserts. Considering the dramatic death scene with a boom that lifts the camera out through the windows and sky, I suppose we have to confuse her death. But her is the first body we don't care about.
