I was really, really disappointed with this movie. it started really well and built up a good atmosphere and excitement, but when it finally came around to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems ...... again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another nutjob movie ... which we don't already have enough of them. To be fair, "creep" is really disturbing to look at, and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes is pretty incredible, but I'm sorry to rent movies like this only to find that the monster is human , though a twisted, demented, freakish. When I saw all the rats early on, I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing ... it was such a failure when Creep was revealed. <br /> <br /> On top of this, some of the things in this movie make no sense. (Spoiler) <br /> Why in the hell is the Creep Security Guard killing? What is the point, except to stick a large honking enrollment that says "HI, I am a PSYCHO and I live here!"? Its stupid, and it seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. <br /> <br /> What has he eaten in there? I got the impression that he was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening in the tunnel section let him lose ... then he has been crushing rats all the time, and if so why are they hanging so much around him? Why is he so horrible to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not even at the highest performance ... but seems to continue despite injuries similar to those that destroy the non-psychic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD comment says we're meant to empathize with Creep, but I just find him noisy. It's an effective enough movie, but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick.
