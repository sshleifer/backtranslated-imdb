Rumor has it that when NASA's technical advisers to this movie were asked to keep the image credible, they laughed for hours. After all, unless you are a politician or work / crew shuttle, you will not get into the shuttle. Furthermore, Space (Cadet) Camp in Alabama, not Florida. The truth is, everyone on earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this movie ever become possible. This movie was intended for children and may be written by one because they are not aware of the numerous limitations and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie of all time, and it was a well-deserved flop.
