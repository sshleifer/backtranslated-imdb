OK .... I only have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and cheesy! The only redeeming feature of this movie is Dean Cain. Apart from that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a really vibrant breath - giving us more of "Jurassic Park" meets "Fire of Fire" ..... There are some good opportunities, but they just don't follow .... The special effects are decent - even though you know the dragon is CGI, it doesn't look terrible CGI .... I wouldn't blame Dean Cain (though he is one of producers), I would add more to the Phillip Roth director and the author. It's his job to make this movie .... and unfortunately he has failed.
