There is very good that can be said for this cartoon; Backgrounds are rich, lush colored and full of nicely finished art deco details. The animation is up to the usual study standards of the time, which is undoubtedly higher than today. But I find it boring for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> The music: It's certainly not up to Scott Bradley's usual standards. Although likely to be evocative of a "Great Gatsby" setting, it ends up being sad, tired, repetitive and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous is not the same as Beethoven's 5th Symphony confirms). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there is much of the visual part of the comic which will be missed by the average seer. Storyline: I'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot overview - land well, city bad. This is a common theme in movies, both animated and alive, from this era. It is a misplaced nostalgia for a non-existent rural idyll, which today is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that were never.
