I've seen this movie a long time ago (about 10 years or so) and liked it then. I remembered it the other day and decided to see it again. The second time it was not pleasant. The plot is 'so, so', the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> The actor ... I'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play these characters. The reason ... there is no way in hell, the women would have won away with the first robbery much less on the 2nd. (Side note: why did TT not know that even though she came up with a lot of money for her right date , they would ask where she got it, and she would have no logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a villain!). It is terribly stereotypical black women to say that the only way black women can "beat the system" or get a large sum of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. It plays too much on the sympathy b / c all die in the end (bar jada) but it's not sad (you think 'they were so stupid they deserve to die). You just don't care about the characters unless you are a shallow person. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie rates over a 5.
