"Igor and Lunatics" is a totally scary and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killer-spree horror movie. Apparently, even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring over-house enthusiastic but incompetent garbage players. This is a typical Troma production, which means that there are a lot of boring and completely irrelevant padded footage that will accompany the mismatched plot. There is a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display ?? which is not bad ?? But it is so much pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. "Igor and Lunatics" are so desperate that it even uses a lot of footage twice, which killed around the circle day. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addict and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower-ranking disciples, named Igor, becomes too obsessed with the biblical stories and drug organs and gradually gets the whole cult to lie down in criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a small example, exactly where crazy Igor is: He tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There is an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some really embarrassing lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks like slow motion movies and lurid dream sequences. Perhaps there is a sequence that more or less qualifies as worth for waste patrons, and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For a particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the leaf in the blooded stomach for fifteen full seconds.
