I'm happy to see most other people here, don't think much about this movie either. It has some big names in the cast, but that's it. There is nothing else to recommend and save a few beautiful women that you can do in a thousand movies. The story involves nothing but unlikely, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters, which national film critics allow everyone to ... and most of the public cannot stand. Oklahoma accents are so fake, they are ridiculous, the southern racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
