There is no story! The reason is hopeless! A movie based on a car with a fixed accelerator, no brakes, and a fixed, automatic transmission cannot be good! I would have stopped the car within a minute, whether I was in it or in the police car constantly following it. I'm sorry about the actors who had to put up with such a bad script. The few scenes that a similarity with action were greatly over-dramatized, and so far from reality one can get. In addition, there were many blunders, for example the hood of the running car, which was popped to make 100 mph. First, it just folded over the windshield as it would in reality, but then it was blown off. The car was later seen in the movie with a hood on .... <br /> <br /> This movie was nothing but annoying, keep away from it!
