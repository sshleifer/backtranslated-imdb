Yes, I was fortunate enough to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was a great experience and I paid to watch the movie when it hit theaters back in 1985. It's terrible. Almost everything fails. First, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is an apologetic choice - almost as bad as John Huston was hired to lack ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut up the songs and CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the game was these dancers - these hungry talented artists just wanted a chance to show what they could do, and when they got their chance, you couldn't take their eyes off them. But this throw just gets by dancing, doing a "nice" job, but none of them sparks a bit. In fact, look up the cast at IMDb - neither of them really went on to do anything much. (OK, okay, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema togwreck does not pick up for a second the magic, desperation, musical scene's passion. A total strike! (But even if they try to disturb the music - the great music still rises at times and reminds people of how great the score was).
