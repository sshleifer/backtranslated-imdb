Knights were just a beginning of a series, a pilot one could say. The plot (I shouldn't call it there was no plot) was not at all logical, and there were many errors like [warning, I sum up the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie said somebody that there were only a few of these cyborgs (the evil ones), but after the climax Nea found out that there were many many more of them. And it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them with one stroke. <br /> <br /> The movie was just pure sparking. I wasn't surprised at all when I found out that the leading star was a kickboxer. <br /> <br /> There was a positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a lot of laughter when you looked at it and talk about it with my friends. I recommend seeing it if you need laughter.
