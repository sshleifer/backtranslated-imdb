In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs such as Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did on Friday the 13th, Valentine fails. Why did people have Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that has ever been done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick who hardly has anyone do anything. The reason is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend, it's not fun. And the moment the killer comes on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. Teen Slasher Genre is DEAD Get Over It! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
