I just came back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say that I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow moving (don't let me confuse, I enjoy slow moving movies!), Slowly to the point of driving you crazy. All you hear, Julio Chavez breathes hard throughout the movie. It is a badly made movie, but more importantly it is a movie without inspiration, I felt nothing for the story or its characters. "El Otro" was only made for the sake of making a movie ... make it forgetful. I would advise you to pass this on if you want to see good Argentinian movies, watch movies after Sorin.
