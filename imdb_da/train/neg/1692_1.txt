Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you've pretty much seen The Grudge. It tries to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud noises, but it fails unlucky. The reason, if you can call it, is weak and quite full of gaps, for example, how would the care center know that Yoko didn't come up for work because the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not quite clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He was just kind of came out of nothing to promote the plot. It didn't make much sense what happened to the original family. Who hung in the living room, little boy or father? And was Yoko alive or dead when the nursing home found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too sorry to think about it any more.
