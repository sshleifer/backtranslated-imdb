I've seen bad movies before, but one takes by far the "worst movie of life" award !! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill to get his name attached to it - anywhere! I will never see another movie with him in it, lead it, etc. Etc. I can't believe the other actors and actresses I liked (in this picture) who bent so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some good drugs out there! For someone not to be embarrassed to be part of such a movie, I'm over! Save your money on this! BIG FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr Hopkins! Also shame on Christian Slater! I can't believe you put your reputation on the line for this!
