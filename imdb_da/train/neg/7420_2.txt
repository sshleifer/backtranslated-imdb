a romance without feeling, a drama of trouble without point (or drama) .... This movie must be all these and fail on every account as if it is not trying. Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team doesn't really try. The actors are capable of - they need better support. <br /> <br /> An element that doesn't fail is scored by George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. What a shame it is attached to this movie. In a good movie, the effects sync and amplify words and movements and music. This editor plastered on music without regard to dialogue and movement. The love scene is especially lattice in this respect: an insult to the talents of the main actors. <br /> <br /> There is another feature of the movie that works: location photography. Especially for a moment in Grand Central Station. I had guessed beforehand what was going to happen but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Some commentators at this forum have pointed out that American assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually occurred during these years by MacCarthy scare. The moment the movie seems to start looking seriously at American society, it switches to conventional romance; Before any human emotion can move, it is on a (predictable) 'thriller' escapade. <br /> <br /> Just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it offends the problems it claims (and fails) to take up. <br /> <br /> You will be warned.
