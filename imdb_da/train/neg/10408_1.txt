If Fassbinder has made a worse movie, I will definitely not see it! Anyone complaining that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to watch this to learn how to appreciate the more part-style he chose in excellent films such as "The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant". This film kills with so much artificial, quasimatric images, it looks like a parody of an "art film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira's prostitute friend channels waves for what looks like ten minutes are just two of the sharpest examples of what makes this movie a true test of the viewer's endurance. But what really attacks me is the few scenes that are only Elvira and her former wife and / or her daughter. These are the only moments that show any real human feelings, and prove that the core of this horrible film was an excellent movie that struggles to free itself. What a waste.
