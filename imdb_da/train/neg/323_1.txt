This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing anything else. There was no plot and no point. I was bored boring and for a movie about a stand up comedian I couldn't remember a joke or a fun line that was worthy of the description. Politicians without charismatic technical jargon could not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> So how was it made? Is there no quality control in film? Looking at the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this terrible experience. It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies, could survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny at least in this movie, so it shows that writing is so vital in effective comedy.
