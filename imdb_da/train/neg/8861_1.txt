Terrible horror to "The Howling". This is related to Karen White's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first movie). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee unfortunately) arrives there and tells Kar's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He is going to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) head werewolf. Ben and a colleague of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> A horrible script, poor direction, spooky editing and really horrible plays by Brown and McEnroe single-handed sink this one. The werewolf effect is mostly kept in the dark - with good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Sub-par special effects too - although I seemed like cartoon lightning coming from Daning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is particularly stupid and Danning takes its top at least EIGHT TIMES during the final credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I found the village of Transylvania entertaining - it seems that it comes from a universal horror flick from the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies, and Lee and Danning are good at this - but they can't save it. Really - why did they do this? Where are they hard for money ??? This is one of IMDb's lowest rated movies. It alone must tell you something. Probably Danning was horrified when she saw the movie - I can understand why! A must-miss.
