Oh, to cry aloud this must be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that the usual awesome John Cusack himself was involved in this brainless, twitty piece of Stupidity. Where sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts are the same message, albeit at a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer and then continues to pound it into your psyche for the next boring one and a half hours ( and it is an hour and a half in my life, I never come back again, thank you so much !!). It is bad enough that the film's protagonists have the emotional maturity of 14-year-olds (in fact, I have known better fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was pleasant enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie, where Kate Beckinsale's character plays the annoying silliness of a game of throwing all the sensibilities to the wind (literally), my best friend and I had been annoyed beyond belief. I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the characters in Rockstar were not half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this "serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to see protagonists who seem to have no idea of ​​choice in their lives, and feel that they are no more than popping to fate and the fate of fate. How completely tiring. I'm sure this movie will be more likely to be enjoyed by those who would rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences. There is, after all, a film where our hero and heroine live happily ever after first destroying the lives of others in the lives of two other people (namely their respective fiancé), not to mention other family and friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
