All the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the long hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion) and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard this movie was on production and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, even if you don't hear about this movie when talking about the actor), and his acting is not what screws up the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is plagued with lots of pointless characters that don't add anything to the plot (like Blob or Gambit) thrown there to make fans think the filmmakers had read the original comics . <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories, and this film did not respect any of them. None. Not even the continuity. It does not respect the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost, the motivation for wolverine is plain stupid and seen in millions of movies: Revenge of a lover's death. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I expected the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to what he has in X2 at school when Stryker men come in and he alone decimates enemy forces, but hey, it's Fox, it's a family girl and you won't see explicit violence from the most violent and cruel Marvel Hero. In addition, I had a sense of constant deju v√π with this movie because Wolverine's Origins are already explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton, so it makes no sense to make a movie of something we already know. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that wolverine is one of the few characters that does not need a solid back story because mystery is the character of the character. Do we really want to know how Joker got his scar?
