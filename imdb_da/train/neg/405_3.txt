This movie is worth seeing if you enjoy wondering about special effects. There are some interesting visuals. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the typical nineties / hollywood Hollywood fare for non-fabric glare. True to the title. <br /> <br /> It's not worth picking the story apart. It's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There isn't much to begin with. It is not original and not very special. So don't go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects. As mentioned, it became a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great FX treatment to an invisible (and sometimes half invisible) man. But if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it is a sight to see (or not see). All in all, it's a decent FX movie worth seeing for that purpose alone.
