You would not expect a movie like this to be good and it is not. It's a no-budget, ultra-violent zombie movie filmed with a poorly watched handheld camera ... and it's fun. The actors have never acted before, and it shows in their horrible funny readings. There is no reason to see. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped, and a group of zombies seem to be terrorizing a few families. Gore effects are actually some of the most diseases I've ever seen. It seems that the gore effects raided a butcher shop to all body parts, and many scenes involve zombies that dismembering people and eating their bodies. It's a fun and disease movie, and it's about as bad as you can get in the form of movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
