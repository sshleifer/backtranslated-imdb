Many horror fans seem to love scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying I found it to be quite boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to draw so much. I think the biggest problem is that it is all set in the dark. Sometimes horror movies can be in the dark (like Humongous), but scarecrows are in the dark for the whole movie. Much of the time, it is difficult to find out what is actually happening, and although a few pictures of scarecrows were scary, most were difficult to see themselves. If a little more lighting had been used, it might have been better. <br /> <br /> There aren't many movies involving killer scarecrows of my knowledge, except Dark Night Of the Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend it over Scarecrows any day.
