Rookie suffers so much. There are the random musical songs scattered throughout the movie, the long pointless script and enough grid slapstick to blush Jerry Lewis. Noonan and Leavitt just don't know when to finish. It takes an hour before the story finally reaches the main plot, and the characters are being used. Then the guys start playing Japanese sailors with today's standard racist caricature. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play the stupid, stereotypical Japanese guys. But it gets rather tedious after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. Then it just ends abruptly. Even a nude Julie Newmar in a towel cannot save this. <br /> <br /> There's really little charm in the movie and it's over half an hour too long. The story just flies along with trying to create fun situations and fail. Stick to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had the animated face.
