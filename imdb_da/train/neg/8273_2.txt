Much promise and nothing more. An all-star cast determined by HK standards, but man oh man is this one stinks. No story? It's okay, the action will make up for it like most HK action flicks. What? The action is horrible, corny and sparse? Dragon Dynasty releases up to this point are largely excellent and generally regarded as classics in Asian cinema. This is a blush. They managed to scare a few actors from Infernal Affairs, but they cannot bring life to a heterogeneous script. There are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with an incision between each and every continuity in what the characters say. You almost feel they each give a running monologue and just ignore the other characters. Michael Biehn is made of wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a stunt double? No way. Yes way. Stay away.
