Apparently, Hollywood is just giving out money to everyone with a camera and the ability to speak. This movie was fun numbingly bad. The molding was horrible, the unreal play, and the story filled with holes. Script? who needs script? I was surprised that the movie was not as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be, but I got enough shots of T & A to keep me a lifetime. The movie was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) telling a story. To be so poorly written, I thought the two brothers in the movie were lovers at first. The scenes at the railway station along with the biggest female actor in the film kept me thinking of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of movie that Grindhouse modeled on ... only the authors thought they were serious.
