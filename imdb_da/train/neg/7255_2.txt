I was not particularly impressed with this movie, which has dark music and lasts only 40 minutes. God God because I fell asleep. I make an excellent use of time shift photography to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, it is all that is. My preference is for its predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 in 87 minutes and to prove that a successor can be better than the original, Powaqqatsi made in 1988 for 90 minutes. Try them both.
