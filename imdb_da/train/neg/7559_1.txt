This should be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen, and I've seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplified reading of the plot. The actors are not acting. I can't blame them - they've got a script of such complete banality, all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with the evil goods of SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that rings true - not an honest line or a single moment of moving. The Nicholas Cage character is so poorly drawn that one does not feel a sense of compassion for him through all his hardships. I have no doubt that I saw a suffering man up there, but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware that he was in the worst movie throughout his career.
