First of all, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's the kind of horror that comes under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with which you know, Fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine. I just hope this movie would be okay. It had lots of chances, with a big roll, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury himself wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. First of all, it was stupid. Much of the horror from the book was lost, as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book ... away. Everything that made you twist ... away. <br /> <br /> And then there's the actor. Like many films that Disney released in the 80s, the children in this movie can't act. And this bugged me a lot, none of them saw 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were acquaintaces. <br /> <br /> You think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this out in their roles by Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it is just as they just don't care. All they want to do is somehow pay some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine as a witch, but the witch's charecter wasn't well off. She is much less vicious and has no presence as she did in the book. <br /> <br /> And all that was left of the book. Ballon night chase, the mark of Jim's house, Mr. Dark's real death, what happened to Mr. Coogan on a merry walk, the fate of the light spinner, the real death of the witch and oh so much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even in the 80s. The stupid round of judgment for one thing with the superimposed horses going around was not really scary, and the weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could go on with how this movie tore out the original novel, but it does blood-burning. Don't watch this movie, but read the book. It's a classic of Bradbury.
