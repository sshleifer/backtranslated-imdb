A good casting (with a great exception) pushes through Epstein's smart light satire. Mansfield was never better or more fun than she's here with Walston, who is a veteran determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his friends - including suave con-artist Grant - go to San Francisco with leave and begin the city's hardest party, suggesting to escape the service entirely through industrial speeches. The only thing about this movie, which is not nice, is Suzy Parker's consistent performance as Grant's love interest, which takes too much of the movie's time and slows the pace in the other half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; The gimmick is that she is prepared to love every service man (to make his duty of war effort of course) but he is a married man who still loves his wife. They steal the movie with a little trouble from Grant (who's entertaining here in the first part of the movie when it's not paired with its non-actor co-star.
