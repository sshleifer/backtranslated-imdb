This movie is one of the most wildly distorted depictions of the story. Horribly inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and native slavery workers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "over the white man's bodies", as evidenced by the chief's Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such indescribable horrors of the Japanese prisoners are the source of a movie where the bridge itself is not close to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of the survivors still living today? They hate the movie and everything it has to represent. Their friends were starving, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who did not die of dysanti, hunger or disease, are deeply hurt by the film that makes such light in their dark times.
