This must be one of the worst movies all the time. The graphics were horrible, the actor was b-movie, and the effects were just Nintendo 64-qualified. You would think they would put more effort into it. It is of course a Scifi channel film, so you have to expect it to be low, but one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, like a shake-your-head in disbelief movie, do it well here. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to have some 'famous' actors and actresses in this, it's hard for me to believe they didn't realize that the quality of this movie was their time and worth the effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics could have been good in the 60s or even early '70s, but come on, it's 2009! I don't want to give spoilers out, let's just say if you've played "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64, you'll be very familiar with what you see in this movie. It is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the case
