A previous reviewer called this movie "pure visual pleasure" I wonder if he / she saw the same movie as I did. "High Art" had to have the most relentlessly depressing interior since "Seven". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the clich√© to come to a B&B for their first time. Of course, before doing so, one must see the opium-den parties inhabited by people who do not seem to have paid employment, but can somehow support the habit of flowering matter. Not to mention the icy stalks of the well-known movie types, the girlfriend / boyfriend at the start, who are aware that they will be thrown over once in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also states that the Sheedy character has withdrawn from professional photography for ten years now. What did she do, retiring at age 20?
