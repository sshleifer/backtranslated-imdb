Well, I had to sit down on the computer and write down the review just after watching this sausage of oozes. Why? Because I have to let it be known to you all, how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just to tell you how bad it is, I will offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of chaos, which usually consist of people shooting or kicking zombies, they interfere with scenes from the video game. Yes, you have heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think that it costs ten dollars these days to just enter the theaters these days. And to see corn stuffed shit like this? There is no story to talk about, and the film has basically nothing to offer anything but the occasional boobs and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing I saw it. OK, I'm a dumbstruck. It's so bad I can't even find the words. RATING: ZERO out of *****.
