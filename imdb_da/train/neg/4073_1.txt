NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but it has to be the poorest attempt to make one ever. Calling it "a movie" is also a stretch. This "random-clips-of-obviously-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-ugly-woman-trying-to-action-sexy-edited-bad-together" is not worth seeing. <br /> <It looks interesting to look at some random family vacation photos, and it has about the same quality you would expect when sending your 10-year-old son into the forest with your new vid-cam and telling him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Awful.
