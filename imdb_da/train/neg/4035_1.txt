I hate being the one to count on a parade (even a small one), but from the very first scene you could tell that this movie would be absolutely dirty. It's really a shame as I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was fascinated by how they would mix in a movie together, but to my dismay they didn't even have a scene together !! I think I should repeat this - the two main actors (standing next to the billboards and DVD covers) didn't have a scene together !!!! They didn't talk to each other and never came on the screen at the same time. Almost summarizes this poor excuse for a movie. False advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unrealistic and non-human. The scenarios were far-fetched, the plot was bad, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be fun (and played a poor man Tim from the office), no one was sympathetic, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to turn off, which I could not bear to watch, or listen to them anymore. <br /> <br /> This low budget stink was an epic error. Even Danny Dyer could not inject any humor and charm into this, but blessed he tried. What a waste of time. How anyone could judge this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I don't even want to give some of the stars ten stars, as ten stars mean that a movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which means it was almost completely gloomy throughout. <br /> <br /> See it if you want to, but if you've seen a lot of movies and so much of big movies, your review will probably look like mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
