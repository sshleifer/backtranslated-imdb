Here is an indie film I really wanted to suffer, but in the end it couldn't. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows and kills the picture. The story is an indecent mess that is not worth trying to find out. I quickly got bored within 10 minutes, so suffered through the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before hitting the chapter stops (mercifully) coming to the end ... even that was not worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly trying hard to be clever and lifts its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has not been done before and better. This movie would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute card, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the economic reasons that I assume motivated it to be stretched out to 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise and I wish him good luck.
