I watched this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. It had an X rating for a short scene of oral sex, but played in mainstream theaters (it was an "art" movie). Probably the first movie ever to show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. What I saw was a boring tale of a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned before, Detmer is very beautiful with a good body, but she also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to say the least) rather poor. It's no wonder he never made another movie. Yet, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but rather short), this is a slow boring story that bored me stupidly. Detmer's good happened only to a certain point. For the most part, I looked at my watch and waited patiently for it to end. If it didn't have that sequence, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. Boring and slow. You can skip this one.
