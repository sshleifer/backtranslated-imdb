This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to make a movie costarring the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than not make the horrible movie. I have to say I could see Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS in a movie. Adam Sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and intentionally putting your cock in a blender. Anyone with half a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth the dime. If I had an extra dollar and needed it, I would give it to the Lorraina Bobbitt Foundation support before buying this movie.
