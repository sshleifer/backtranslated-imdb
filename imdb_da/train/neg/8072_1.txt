(One possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" may be the worst theatrical release ever. Nothing makes sense at all, there is some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not have died. The whole movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really bind together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The Tha play is non-existent, the camera's work is jerky and the script is so confusing, it makes the movie even harder to see. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to tie the movie together, but nothing came. Absolutely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
