Although the book was not exactly accurate with the real situation it described, it was still a feeling of Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie had ever been to Japan, because it didn't feel like Japanese at least. Almost everything about it was terrible. I will admit that the actors were generally quite good, but could not stand a chance to save it. Before the movie started, I was surprised that only ten people were in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the film was opened in Japan. 30 minutes in I was amazed that they stayed. I was so I would have the right to criticize it. The whole movie was drawn with my groaning and suppressed treasure of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. All I saw out of the cinema had the appearance of confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /> <br /> For the creators of this movie you owe me two hours.
