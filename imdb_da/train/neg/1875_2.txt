First, I really loved Henry Fool, who puts me in a very small pool of movie guests. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this movie was a full-out travesty. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride, and making meaningless analogies to Star Wars - was stomach twisting. This was the hype of the manufacturers (HDNET) realized to max. A true example of the emperor and his new clothes. For the most part, I feel that Hal has spoiled HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can ever see it again in the pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can fire some of the people sometimes ... etc. The conductor would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out pointless garbage. Unfortunately, it is a pure example of the lesson taught in the movie ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or its hope for the box office is bad. Never mind a decent story. For the actors, it seemed as if trying to act in a panties. <br /> <br /> The result, I think Hartley's, is tasteless. With drum hits goes whole dialogue. There was an Apple Soundtrack loop, I recognized that I got a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to grab a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous trip. I would be happy to spoil this movie for you, but it has been done. It's the mess. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
