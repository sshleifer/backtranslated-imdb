I had never heard of this before the owner of my local DVD landlord mentioned it to me; Being an 1980 horror with the infamous difference of being banned in the UK, I decided to check it out. The movie turned out to be a dull, amateurish and ugly trip; the sound recording is so bad that the dialogue is incomprehensible half the time, while the play gives new meaning to the word! Worse, the movie follows the very tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident and finds themselves protected by a dysfunctional family living in distant surroundings. Soon one of the girls goes to seek help and is never heard again; another, still bedtime, is disposed of quickly (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one who interacts most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan from a bible-dumping mother (cue horrendous overacting), her oppressed (and long-suffering) daughter and the latter's odd brother, who occasionally appears on stage to plunge over the sleeping female guests. <br /> <br /> Often, you go to the table theme calls of the man-hatred mother (as a means of filling out the boring, not to say anything about the unoriginal, backstory) and inevitably evolving into mother-daughter sparring competitions, the movie has an ace up the sleeve - twisting is as unexpected as it is brilliant, but it does not do much to remove the bad taste in the mouth of the film (as much through it all as the intermittent gore) or the inevitable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ...
