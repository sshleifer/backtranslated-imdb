I can't remember that "Barnaby Jones" is no more than a very boring, standard detective show, where, as in every Quinn Martin show, Act I was the murder, Act II was the protagonist who found out the murder, Act III was plotted. twist (another character murdered), action IV was the decision and the epilogue was betty (leu meriwether) asking his father-in-law barnaby jones (buddy ebsen) how he found out the crime and so someone says something witty at the end of the show. One thing I remember was the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding theme song. Strangely, the open credit sequence made me see the show occasionally in the seven seasons, the show was on the air. I would also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role than Jed Clampett, although Ebsen is badly mistaken. I just wanted the show to be more entertaining than when I first remembered it. Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their US TV channel archive. Let's just say I was more friendly than Goldsmith about the show "Barnaby Jones."
