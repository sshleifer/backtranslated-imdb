I heard so much about this movie, how it was a big slasher and one of the early 80's that died hard fans of most slasher movies just had to watch. Well, I rented it, and I have to say that even though it was my attention as far as the excitement goes for most slasher movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this movie could have been right up there with the above mentioned, it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the ongoing story. Signs that I found unfortunate to be in this movie were the weird guy with the milled hair that stuck around in the college and, of course, leading up to his true climatic role at the end with him facing the killer. Another would be the dirty, scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played several roles in this movie that could have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls, while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then lowers his portion and cuts him to the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed in the end at last. As far as the killer's true identity goes, when the identity was released to whom he was, I just laughed, but it was quite obvious, and he really made a true move out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. . This movie should be one at least once for all slasher fans, but do not spend your hard earned money on it in some rare difficult to find collectors inventory.
