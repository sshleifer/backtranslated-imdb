I actually saw this movie in the theater back in the original release. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrass himself so much. The story was incredibly lax and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the mighty ones had fallen. I won't say I'm a big Peter Sellers fan, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt he was giving a strong performance in being there. But this movie should never have been made. From what I read, he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him. Fine, but it still doesn't apologize for the studio, which actually releases the movie.
