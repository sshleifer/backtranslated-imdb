In my knowledge, Largo Winch was a famous Belgian comic book (never read) that tells the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without spy life! So when I was to choose a movie for a 5 year old child, I picked it up because the baby was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But right after the opening circles, there was great doubt: when American movies offer great start, here, no action and a disturbing sex scene ?? Then the story becomes very complicated with economic features ?? I thought I lost the baby. <br /> <br /> Strangely, though, he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship that Largo has with his father? The more box history where the friends are the bad ones, the bad ones are the friends? The exotic places in Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he really cares about Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
