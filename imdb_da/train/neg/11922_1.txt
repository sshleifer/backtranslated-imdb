Some illegal so-called asylum seekers come to Stuttgart and find that the Germans are "racist". <br /> <br /> This is just another already forgotten nugget in a long list of anti-German propaganda films after World War II aimed at making the Germans feel "bad" so as not to bid everyone degenerate in their country, he can hunt German blondes and sell drugs to German teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for good German movies in General, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa" and "Lola ridden." <br /> <br /> But not this . <br /> <br /> Also, "Das Experiment", with the same male actor from "Lola ridden."
