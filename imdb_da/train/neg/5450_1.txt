Such a pretentious and lame attempt to hip. Diabolic script and dialogue and really embarrassing plays. Really the worse movie I've ever seen (at the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster. I saw it when it came out in a movie theater in Brighton. People went out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium! At the end there was angry and mockery of the modest crowd left, which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and really sheep. But the movie was so bad that I really couldn't feel it sympathetic to them. Everyone must start from somewhere, and their son started his acting career with this truly awful attempt at 'Tarantinism made in the UK'. 5 years has gone by, but sometimes I still crawl in the memory of the sad night in the cinema! This is a movie without redeeming features at all! I gave it a 1 when 0 was not available. They should invent a 'shameometer' for anyone involved in this upset movie. I know some of them have moved to better things, the positive is that none of them could have picked anything lower than this.
