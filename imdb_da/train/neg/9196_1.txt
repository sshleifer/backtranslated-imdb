This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seemed comical. First there is no reason. The actors seem to read off cue cards and do the stupid things. Like being chased by dead people, yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also, the zombies were horrible, not nearly as fun as any of Romero's work that gets the plug in the movie. And the stupidest part of all was the show by flashing the video game in the action sequences. As we do not get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all 20 somethings some how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And how people die is so stupid. It's as if they run out of ammunition, so stand around and wait to be jumped on. And when they're the corner in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of shooting the door open, so stupid. FINALLY VALUE: If any of these actors appear in another movie, they have been blessed with another chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen this year. A B-movie on cinemax is better.
