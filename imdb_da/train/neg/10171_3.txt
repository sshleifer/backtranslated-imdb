Comparing with American graffiti is inevitable, so save your money and time by hiring the timeless classic. Talking about timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers, where Norm and Cliff competed for who can find most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie all from some of the songs and some of the clothes were wrong. There was sly reference as 'they paved the paradise to set up a parking lot'. Filmmakers hoped to evoke some smiles from us, but made me basically moan. The characters in this movie are incredibly political and socially slim for teenagers. Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and eighties when they wrote the Darn movie. Very little of what the characters said was credible. Combine the bad writing and bad plays this movie just totally fails. Though there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams exclaimed things like the future infant, and despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. Shows the burning characteristic that would boil in his last appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
