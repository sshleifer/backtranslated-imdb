Honestly, this is easy in the 5 best movies I've ever seen. Secondly, because it takes so seriously, unlike ordinary light-hearted garbage, these films will help to be emotionally involved, to feel the signs and to worry about the alleged conspiracy. None of this ever comes close to happening. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so horrible: 1.) Coherent and completely non-sensory plot. 2.) Annoying style-over-substance "MTV" camera work. 3.) Moronic signs and plot holes. <br /> <br /> Allow me to elaborate. <br/> 1.) Apparently, when these movies were made, they could not decide whether to make a film about church, stigmata or possession. So guess what? They combined them! An aetheist is obsessed with a dead person who then makes her exhibit stigmata to issue a church conspiracy. How an ordinary person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained or even spoken of. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her Stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we are treated to scenes of screaming things in hard voices, cutting out cryptic messages on cars and writing messages on walls. Apparently, this priest was also a fierce guy, because the obsessed young lady also wigs out on one of the characters as he spoke in the clumsy, hard "obsessed" voice that we all heard countless times. This also begins to tie into my second complaint, because when the young lady gets stigmata, she also delays the law of gravity by floating into the air and throwing everything and everyone around her as if they had an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it was so cool. <br /> <br /> 2.) These movies feature dozens of pictures, in slow motion, of course, birds that appear out of nowhere and fly away, and most annoyingly, of water droplets. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANT! Logically, the place will probably fall apart with this many holes. To summarize this complaint, at the end, and for no absolute reason, the camera cuts into shots of water drops, in slow motion, vice versa !! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance to anything, and again I bet because the director thought it was so "cool". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the protagonists says he became a priest to explain away gaps in science. It doesn't make me sense. I would think going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through the entire rigamarole to become a priest. I just don't buy it. Second, there are lots of plot holes, some of which I will elaborate on below. Initially, when she first gets stigmata, the stage ends with her consciously bleeding. Then she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is towards the end when the previously mentioned "scientific priest" character speaks to the spirit that owns the girl. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" Not a word for word quote, but you get the idea. His answer? "You have no faith, only doubt!" Because of this, he possesses an aetheist! An atheist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then there is the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy, this Lost Gospel (from St. Thomas, I believe) is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to suppress this document, but you can go down to a bookstore and buy it. Perhaps this should be done in an alternative story where it is not known, but the film never tries to tell us this, or even suggests that this is an alternative occurrence of the document's cover. <br /> Finally, this movie is horrible to a spectacular degree. It is my arch-nemesis that I feel the need to offend any chance I get. I scare it. Final grade: F
