I watched this movie recently at a film festival. It is the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a major depression and a single medieval woman working in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the movie's 'social' theme and turning it into a Romanesque comedy. The main actor did a good job, he certainly looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working-class woman, she seems to work and speaks a lot like a "senior" woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it anyway in all her movies. The movie's whole mise-one scene was very poor. The shooting is ugly, doesn't use well on all the panoramic aspect ratios. The dialogue sounds completely scripted and boring most of the time. The comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not fun at all and are loosely resolved. In my opinion, this movie is not worth seeing. Only if you really love Pereira's earlier films, you like this little bit. Anyway, I went out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder what an instructor feels when he sees someone going out of one of his films, especially one that is made to satisfy everyone.
