A good throw and they do their best with what they get, but the story makes no sense, the character's actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of accidental humor, such as when a man is killed by being pierced by pieces of a phonograph record, or when they get the witch full to a hip hop beat and then hit her over her head with a bottle and she grabs her hostages and puddles. The scene where the two witches and her victim (the game of the same actress) are in the house together, poses as a 3 Stooges routine, and the plot raises the question: If the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul, why doesn't it She just does it instead of leading these people to this elaborate hunting? Not to be missed is Christopher Walkin's eyeglasses and his car-legend of the afterlife (paraphrased): "The ancient Egyptians - the bad materialists. They expected the body to last through eternity as a used car that you swept up. But the Druids, they knew you couldn't drive in the afterlife. You had to go out and go. "Huh? The end is absolutely impossible. Seems like they just came out of movie.
