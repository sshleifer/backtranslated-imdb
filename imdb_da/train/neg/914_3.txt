(Review in English, as Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and unfortunately I can inform you that the film didn't live up to them. <br /> <br /> As much as I loved seeing Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the authors early in the scriptwriting process had realized that seven people who fall into the water are not original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes used and predictable, those who are not, are simply boring. I smiled like three times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The location of Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) fun, why not just a big sign that says; "Findus made it happen!" <br /> <br /> The GÃ¶ta Canal 2 doesn't have to be seen in the cinema or on DVD, just wait for it to be aired on TV, it doesn't take too long.
