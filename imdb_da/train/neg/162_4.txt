A movie that tries to be much better than its decision makers is capable of producing. the movie leash and turns through the miriad plot "surprises" with a desperate attempt to get the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the "plot" with steaming scenes they thought would help it together. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual experiment and just sleeping goes through the movie. The same goes for the other "actors". the plot is rather stupid and sticky. which in itself is not such a crime, but in the end the huge plot twists become very tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> But the film manages to create interest in the center. on the whole, a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't be afraid if you miss it. <br /> <br /> A pretty lama 4!
