This movie really has no beginning or ending. And it's really very incredible. Mary-K and Ashley will be interns working in a post office for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason they are put in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum) and all the other interns they work with are just as abnormal as they are. One thing that I found obvious in this movie is the way in which one of the twins does NOT end with the guy. I suppose they were trying to twist their usual plot a little. Nice try.
