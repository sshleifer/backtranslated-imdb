Okay, first the good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not a Cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part is well written. The camera was well finished and captures a romantic feel. The rest: A thin plotline, Nicholas Cage's performance and a completely immature and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time the time Cage opened its mouth, I was frightened. I don't know what kind of accent he was trying to use. I honestly didn't, it probably wasn't any New York or Italian accent I have ever heard. It was pretty surreal. And it wasn't because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and honestly I have been laughing and feeling more joy in understanding the Italian ethnic family far better than this movie . And it would be on a dull evening at the house. What a disappointment.
