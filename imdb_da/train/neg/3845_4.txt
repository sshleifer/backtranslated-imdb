Although Bette Davis did a fantastic job as Mildred, I felt the movie was not the best I had ever seen. At the end of the movie, I felt as if something was missing in it. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did the perfect job and made me hate her and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard did very well as the beloved Philip Carey, and I watched him in the whole movie to fall in love with such a horrible lady. It's such a sad thing when you find yourself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it is someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic. <br /> <br /> Finally, the play was what came through and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not one to give it away. Although others may find this movie well, I was one who found it uneven. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what can happen to them if they fall in love with the terrible person.
