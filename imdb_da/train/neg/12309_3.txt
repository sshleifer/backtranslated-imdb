This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material --- the army is always good for a laugh --- and the stars, this movie should have been a worn laugh party. It was worth a few chuckles at best. Steve Martin has been much more fun than this, and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should adhere to dramatic roles where he may follow Robin Williams' management and even win an Oscar.
