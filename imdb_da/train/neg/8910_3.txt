This movie has a very simple but somehow very poor plot. The whole movie is about a girl being sucked through a gate to another dimension, so years later it is re-opened by a witch while a group of friends (including the main actor who has trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers with his new partner ... another girl ... that's right, they are lesbians and there is some nudity of course without any particular reason. Unfortunately, the demon follows the now grown girl back through. Unfortunately none of this has ever been explained. How accurate were they? Where did the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who in hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit? The action is horrible, I think, but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad, maybe there just wasn't anything they could do with it. I give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty funny, though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it wasn't quite bad enough to be fun.
