Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also make a habit of gathering coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a way to speak. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /> <br /> Interesting Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) vehicle where he plays the crazy scientist. I was especially scared when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests as they slept. <br /> <br /> Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really appealing as a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter, who was supposed to be a victim, but women's power trumps evil scientists every time. <br /> <br /> 2'11 "Angelo Rossitto and Terrible Frank Moran who liked to put the woman's hair into the movie. <br /> <br /> Interesting look at a 40's horror movie.
