I have always said that some of their plays cannot be translated into movies, and this is an excellent example. As a game, this is a very fun farcical satire of the Catholic Church with a knife joint and a central character that is so shockingly unreal, we must root her even when she starts killing her parishioners (one of whom made the fatal mistake to admit that he had not sinned since his last confession, so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven. It is just an example of how far out of reality the play goes, and in the world war world, the world works. That kind of elevated reality rarely works on movies, and it's certainly not here. Director Marshall Brickman has put together a fine cast that does a great job but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in your stomach's pit. <br /> <br /> Look for a scene play production instead, you won't be disappointed.
