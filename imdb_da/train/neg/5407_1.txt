If you want to see a true "quality movie", get hold of The Eden Formula. This wonderful movie must have cost all $ 50 to make. It has a wafer thin script, pathetic bad set, lighting and camera work and a stop motion, paper-mache monster that is quite ridiculous (it seems that they sometimes used a guy in a rubber boot and / or a glove doll for monster - but everyone was just as awful. <br /> <br /> All actors speak their lines as if they have never seen them before and read a teleprompter. The special effects are much more miserable. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel as hard as you break into the cruden underneath. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
