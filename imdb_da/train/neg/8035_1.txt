This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it's not made for tsv. When you look at the box it says that it is rated R for gore and some languages ​​... Where were things going? Was their a good death scene, where you actually did so? I could have overlooked it if there had been some short nudity or a good dialogue. There wasn't even a distant witty or entertaining line in this lame movie. Sometimes horror movies are fantastic because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
