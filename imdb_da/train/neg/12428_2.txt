I loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I still wonder why they made this horrible movie. The case with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can enter another house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny, but the terrorists in this are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
