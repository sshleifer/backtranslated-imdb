Probably. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedians in the world (at least when he stood for his homeland France), managed to hit a movie, so utterly inaccessible is beyond the reason that the only mortal man should distinguish. It is not only that the characters are so uneven, or that the film is so completely devoid of even the lowest form of white: It is really physically painful to see such an infinite parade of inappropriate writing, acting and filmmaking that you cannot believe on is the work of experienced - and talented - filmmakers. Once, the presence in the cutting room and on the shelf spent before its flash - and you will miss it - the theatrical release tells the whole story. What did they think?
