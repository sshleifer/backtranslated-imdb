I don't understand why low remakes have evolved. Every remake I have ever seen is awful and that is no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones that it is a "cunning" piece of waste, he's right. Why they would take a wonderful TV show that I loved never missed an episode and own seasons 1-4 on DVD and ruined what I never know. The TV show was a family program, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, rescued the clothes. A family show has been turned into a dirty piece of waste and I would not recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast) and they are also very sweet. The new Bo and Luke are not even cute. It was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is horrible. At least they could have got a brunette to Daisy. I also don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg. Every other role he has ever played is quite the opposite of this role. The only role they throw halfway is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but there is still no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor, all of his own, and made him perfect for the role. I think the casting is horrible, the story is horrible and all in all, it ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, horrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to see it. I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to watch this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
