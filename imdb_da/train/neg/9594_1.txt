I signed up for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished sitting through this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that I somehow had the willpower not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what's not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst games I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the sword battle involves motionless swinging of the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent does not do the same. I have seen many student films with better action and stronger plot. So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with bad action and virtually no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie doesn't even have action and shows the evolving relationship with the princess and the farmboy / terrorist and his disturbed sister. The movie has several plot lines and none of them really pans out to be worth anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem could have been that I looked at dub, which was pretty bad. The whole cast muttered all their lines, so it was difficult to follow what was going on. But I got the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the film in my eyes). If you've heard that this is a futuristic action / ninja-flick, you've heard wrong. That's what I thought it was when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Don't let this happen to you. Control it well.
