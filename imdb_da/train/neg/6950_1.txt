We all knew, even before it was sent, the Ron Moore mini series is no Battlestar Galactica. It is fine. It just means that it should stand on its own. It cannot lean on Battlestar Galactica. If that's good, it's good on your own, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If reports are true, that's what Moore wanted. But if his mini-series has hit, he has ashamed all the outstanding actors performing on the screen, not to mention the myriad of screeners. And that's what he's done. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is no remake. I wouldn't even call it a new performance. It is a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not happen in the Galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. It does not tell of Galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. Nor is it dependent on legends and mysteries that support Galactica. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space-opera, action-flick with a ceremonial knot to Battlestar Galactica. Maybe I should say "just another" space-opera, action-flick. Because as plots go, his little one has the original or even interesting. I could relay it all to you without a spoiler warning. But I don't want to put it on you. I just have to beat the main point. Ready now? Here it is: Just watch the trailer. It will tell everything in history. <br /> <br /> Yes, creations of humans turn on man and try to destroy man. (I guess they forgot Azimov's rules again.) They look like humans, so there are whole aliens-among us things. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and lots of fighting situations and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore drew from Galactica, the ceremonial knot, it came from more corny than respectful. I mean, couldn't he even think of himself? <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes I wanted to see something else. I didn't care for any of Moore's characters, as I couldn't identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not give a curse. How depressing. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes, when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, rather tucked away and rescued their own dust. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe way out instead of risking their own lives to defend others. Least aversion is not apathy. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, the Ron Moore mini-series was just a purpose-free activity, a movie on a treadmill that runs continuously, but still doesn't go anywhere. And I just wanted it to be over. And when it was over, my life force had been sucked from me. Against my own will I became a mindless, rare zombie, probably of the type that this mini-series would appeal to. I had to refill myself. I needed - and I swear this is true - I needed to see an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, in fact, and I felt much better. And happier.
