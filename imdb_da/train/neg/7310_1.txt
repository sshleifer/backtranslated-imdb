** SPOILERS NOTE !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever has my nod to WORST movie of the year ... as I've seen it. This movie is just GARBAGE! There's so much wrong with the movie that you can't be surprised at how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but in the end it didn't matter. The characters were as stupid as one could be; for the whole movie you just ask yourself "why would you do it?" or "what is your point in doing this?" ... such is the illogical and stupid characters are. We get no background in them, so of course you really don't give rats like $ about their fate ... you can only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - "The veil" (Marcy) for example ... was she so sweet that she should sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in it .... it's almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to give her the virus so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet at a cabin without first looking at it? <br /> <br /> Why didn't Bert just beat the sick guy from the start? Movies would have been over that way .... In addition, they ended up killing him anyway. Why did it take them so long that they finally decided to leave the cabin, even if they were to leave? No, I'm just waiting until 2 of my friends are infected (a blink of death) to finally go out there. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was Paul's attempt to fish out of Hermit's body, just falling into the contaminated reservoir and getting infected with the virus? Pure STUPIDITY! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an acquaintance with these idiots. I don't think there's ever been a worse end to a movie. In the beginning, the kids ask hick big cashier what the gun was for and he replied that it is for niggers. At the end of the movie, 3 young blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) goes into the store .... came to find out that the cashier cleaned it to stay used for hunting. Then he continues to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke with them as if they were his homeboys. <br /> <br /> Okay, WHERE THE HELL IS THE POINT OF IT?!?!?!? How tasteful can you be, what were the filmmakers? Think about putting it in the movie? Of course, as a black man, I was offended by the initial 'Nigger' comment. It was a tasteless, pointless remark. My question to the filmmakers: What was the end of the black children? Was it forcing me to forget the first racist comment made earlier? To smooth things over with black viewers by making a joke out of it? Well, I for one, did NOT find the pathetic attempt at humor at least fun. The whole movie was a joke .... a pathetic attempt at film making that should not be given in the day. Peter Jackson really thought this movie was so good? What movie was he watching? <br /> <br /> ZERO * out of **** stars .... if I could give it a lower rating I would. Please, fellow IMDbs, don't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life and look at this abomination of a 'movie'. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
