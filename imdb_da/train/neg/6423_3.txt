The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, ready to flip around to see something else. The premise for two authors, down on their happiness, lived in a self-storage "bin" was mildly fun, but painfully gentle. The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - big deal movie guy living in the park and sleeping in a toilet, offered hope and I decided to give it a few minutes. And then a couple more until Kristy Swanson's introduction as a budding movie director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a little spice. Her sturdy performance boosted her presence beyond just a very welcome eye-candy engagement. In the end, they have obvious low budget effects on the movie with poorly shot scenes, concise pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. Some of my favorite films from all the time have been low budget, Whithnail & I is one who also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck. <br /> <br /> But for my money, the actors have saved Tinseltown from the "Terrible Movies" archives and nudge it into "might have been a cult movie" archive. I laughed aloud on some of the scenes that involved Joe Pantoliano's character. Especially the penultimate scenes in the horribly clich√©, but still fun, rich but upscale character house, where the story unravels towards the last minute. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play, and while the filmmakers did their best to translate it into celluloid, it simply didn't work and while I was laughing at some scenes and a liners, I for the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at something. <br /> <br /> Unless you are stuck for an innovative coffee court, do not pick it up if you see it in a good business console.
