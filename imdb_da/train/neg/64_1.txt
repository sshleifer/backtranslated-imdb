This movie was horrible. The finish was absolutely horrible. There was no plot for the movie at all. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the play by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not make their performances any justice. If the script had come close to capturing a half-time proper story, it would be worth seeing. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are totally wasted on a god horrible story ... or lack thereof. I was not alone waiting for the whole movie for something to do to make the movie .... well a real movie ... not just countless dialogue between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was no more than a joint dialogue that would have taken place again during that period. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a wandering, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthwhile happens throughout the film including the end. When the movie ended, I was astonished ... surprised that I was sitting through the whole movie and waiting for something of interest to happen to watch the movie. It has never happened! The piece of characters suddenly began to roll, making it clear that the film was really over, and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours in my life and looked at a movie with absolutely no plot and no sense. It wasn't even a story. The whole movie takes place in a day's worth. That is it. It was a day of life (and death) of some southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (except for the film's training day)? The acting performances of the whole cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie ... if you can even call it a movie.
