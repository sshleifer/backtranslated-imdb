If you hate redneck accents, you will hate this movie. And to make matters worse you see Patrick Swayze, one has tried to be a redneck. I really can't stand redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what is Lonnie Earl's name? How much more hiccup can this movie get? The story was stupid. I'm not usually this condemnation of movies, but I couldn't stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, you should see the Slingshot. My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... characters ... I think I'll pack it up and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It may just be that I can't stand redneck accents normally or that I can't stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze wasn't in it. I didn't even laugh at the movie. I laugh at something stupid as a rule. If they had shown that some fingers were smashed, I could have laughed. the people's fingers are accidentally smashed making me always laugh.
