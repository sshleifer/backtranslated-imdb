- Much contains spoilers ... but believe me, this movie wastes itself from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I went into this movie with high expectations. It was my own fault. I had put too much stock in Steve Carell's record to date. 40 year old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Office. And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. It has always been a very good prediction in the past, but something is definitely out in the past. The last time I felt annoyed and in this very pain in a movie theater, I looked at "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This flick fumbled from start to finish. The writing was flunky material. Terrible to write around. "Murderer of love"? "Love is an ability"? The one who wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that hit American Beauty's author (s) ... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard. The whole girl was peppered with Three's Company 'moments as the awful and constructive shower scene. Or the meaningless / confusing aerobic scene. Or the horrible laundry room scene. Just when you think something serious and / or right is happening, they throw in one of those awful moments. And it happens again and again and again. <br /> <br /> What about Carell's character? The guy meets a little lame wide in a bookstore and is suddenly the head over his heels in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. They should both have said their goodbye after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you are unfortunate to see this movie .... Carell's character tries to say something that is absolutely random and eerie (I believe the exact line was "this time when I was a child "... seriously. But both laugh so hard that the coffee is spitting out of their nose. The actors themselves looked as if they were in pain and wondered why they were instructed to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Back to the IMDb case ... you need to find a way to keep a movie's advertising team from this site. I know this is impossible, but it is painfully obvious that the first 20 or so reviews / reviews were either submitted by 12-year-olds or by flunky's employee of the studio. Check out The Family Stone rating ... if it's a mid 5 then it's absolutely necessary to be a 2 ... and it pushes it.
