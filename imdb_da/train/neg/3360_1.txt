Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King, suggests that a secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what awful things are waiting behind the door to get them. If finally the door breaks up and a ten-meter bug leaps through, the reader may be a little scared, but he'll also think, "Well, I can handle it. At least it wasn't a hundred feet tall." There is nothing more frightening than what lurks, invisible and unknown, just across the closed door and waiting to get you. HANDLING is so completely misunderstood that director Jan De Bont more or less starts his movie by metaphorically throwing open the door himself and shouting: "Look, everyone sees! It's a ten-foot bug! Isn't it SCARY?" The law of diminishing returns begins immediately. At the end of the movie, instead of jumping up and down, the instructor slams his CGI pots and pans madly and loudly screaming: "Look, everyone! Now, here are a hundred thousand-footed bugs! "<br /> <br /> The film authorities apparently thought that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this trial (and there are many). They can't and don't. In fact, impressive as they are, the special effects are so demanding and intrusive that the distracted viewer turns up and stares at them - either in admiration or annoyance - rather than being immersed in a story. <br /> <br /> For me, the nadir of this movie's pure stupidity has come when a "blood" statue that goes out of the mouth tries to drown Liam Neeson (like Dr. Marrow) in a fountain. The film authorities clearly did not know what to do with this alleged idea when they had it, so they just swept Neeson around in the water, smashed their arms and walked smoothly. At the next scene, the good doctor has apparently wiped out and he has forgotten about the annoying event. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been stupid in this ridiculous manuscript of a committee of low-IQ teen stoners who thought the road to scare people was to make each effect bigger and higher: "Okay, let's Now we make the ceiling you know looks like a creepy face and you come down to her ... and all those spiky things that trap her in bed. "<br /> <br /> The only saving grace of HAUNTING is that it finally becomes so terrible that it's actually fun. When Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O 'Death, I just fell on the floor and laughed. <br /> <br /> Poorly constructed, grotesquely heavy-handed, completely unbelievable, and filled with lumpy dialogue and meaningless scenes, this vacuum-packed HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to do a horror movie.
