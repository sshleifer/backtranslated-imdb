One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this flick and I decided it was pretty boring. It was just after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) dropped on the horse of a tree to reunite the good guy. I was pretty much mystified by the entire Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate anything at all. Of course, the name Coppola in the credits could not do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one list. <br /> <br /> If you make it to the end of the movie, you'll probably close asking yourself the same questions I did. What was just the hook with the gloves? What happens to the rodeo scenario? Who would The Stranger represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could go further, but my energy is drained. See, there is already a western named "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Seeing it will make you feel as good as looking at this makes you feel bad. The one I can recommend.
