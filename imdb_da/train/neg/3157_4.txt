Sure, it had some of the prerequisites for a good movie. The storylin is good if it was a bit boring and the play was good enough, though I didn't understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a distinct Australian accent if her character had been raised in the US. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I usually know, the average American is considered a frumpy dresser of any self-respecting European, but this was beyond that. Anna's color combinations were positively awful !! And the potato sack-like, sad excuse for a coat, she wore the whole movie, made me break out in river leaves. I suppose the idea was as realistic as possible (how many teachers go around in Prada?) But simple does not mean an absolute lack of taste. A word to the wise ...
