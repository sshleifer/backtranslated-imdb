This documentary is best when it merely shows the Ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation. There is no denial of the striking poverty in India and the desperation of even their richer customers. However, as an argument for Ayurvedic medicine, this film generally weakens. Although Indian customers mention having seen "aleopathic" doctors, these doctors are not interviewed and we have to take the vague statements of their patients to the face - "the doctor said there was no cure," the doctor said, it was cancer "etc. Well," no cure "does not mean" no treatment "and what type of cancer has exactly the patient? The film is at least weak when showing ayurvedic practice in America. A high-powered Wall Street job can hurt your stomach.
