Average (and surprisingly pretty) Fulci giallo, which means that it is still pretty bad by normal standards, but is redeemed by its solid structure and some fine handpieces as a nice time button on the issues of vision and clairvoyance. <br /> <br /> The well-known weaknesses of the genre are in full gear: banal dialogue, wood-acting, illogical plot points. And the final goes a long way, while the denouement turns out to be quite paralyzed, or should I say: long affair. <br /> <br /> However, Fulci's ironic handling of giallo standards is fun. Yellow tracks anywhere you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 limping killers
