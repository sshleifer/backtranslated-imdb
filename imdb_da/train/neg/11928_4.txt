The sacred lives start with an atmospheric vision of London as a busy city of bustling, picturesque streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it is being knocked down in a story that goes virtually nowhere. Othello works too big, Mr. Karva, fatigue, his crime chief father father at least I think this is what he was supposed to be, because it has never been defined, but he releases kittens in the deepfathers, so trust me, he is a dot) who make scary little peas while his skanky girlfriend gives water craft. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always sticks from A to B. Until that day, he comes across almost mute homeless children, giving him his desire to stop running. Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he immediately begins to give more wishes. Well done to get some of his own wishes fulfilled, the Karva boy has kidnapped. But he is not sure what would really bring him happiness. Is it innocence to be a child again or is it another hand job? Somehow, I don't want to see the little boy give him the other. It just takes ages to get started and there are lots of repetitive scenes. The end is trying to be shocking, but since there is almost no story of investment in any of these characters, it only serves as a release to the bored audience. <br /> <br /> The author Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to interfere in a kind of religious allegory that ends up being pretentious as hell ironic. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the signs that suddenly seemed odd, it would have been a more enjoyable movie. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying high moon that so miraculously seems to develop intelligence when confronted with the mysterious boy. Who's origin is never revealed. It is simply annoying! <br /> <br /> Apart from occasional moments of atmosphere and a humorous score, this movie has little to recommend.
