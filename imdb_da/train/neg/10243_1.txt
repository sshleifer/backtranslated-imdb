This is the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen. DO NOT RENT! The actors in this movie should be the band from ever making another movie. It starts with some of a plot, so it quickly falls to nothing. I think I would rather see paint dare so much as looking at the cover. The actors were horrible, the plot fell quickly, filmed back to a lot of work to do. Not a good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie you will waste your money. I really enjoy National Lampoon movies, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to lead. I feel that I should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental costs and time lost.
