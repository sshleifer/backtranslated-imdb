One of the other commentators mentioned that they almost went out. If I hadn't been with my wife who would stay, I'd have left. It's also a shame because I think it could have been a good movie. But it's easily one of the worst custom screens I've ever seen. It starts nowhere and it goes nowhere (I will say it does not go fast, but it really goes nowhere slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time there are hints that something interesting can happen or that there may be a depth under one of the characters, but that's all we get - tip. There is not a single payout or revelation throughout the film. Not that I need a beautiful plot to be entertained ... I love a good wobbly character study as much as the next indie buff. But these signs add nothing. For the duration of the movie, you don't care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost start to hope they die, because at least one death can be more interesting than seeing their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you think it would be convincing in itself, but it is not. Instead of quirky, noir-esquire characters that work in hard-boiled fashion, you recognize it immediately for what it is: a bunch of talented but miscast actors who spread and raise their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant link. All this to two plodding, painfully slow hours. Terrible.
