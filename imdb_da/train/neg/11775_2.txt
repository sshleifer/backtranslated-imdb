Seeing "Kroko" I would like to have left the cinema for the first time in my life. I do not recommend watching this movie: flat protagonists - absolutely no development, eg. Kroko's metaphorical German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capacity for positive involvement despite several plot-wise possibilities to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolving plot. I suppose the movie tried an environmental survey, but it failed: the camera seemed shaken rather than motivated. The pictures were low - contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure on purpose, but the components haven't added a convincing impression to the social environment. The story had some potential, but it could have made a good story.
