Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s, and most of them are fast, economical and very entertaining. I really love how the studio took advantage of the less glamorous elements of our daily lives. This is one of Warner's few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper that revives the 20-year history of a murderous with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance, but he is surrounded by actors who do not cut mustard. H. B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad plays of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second lead really hurt the movie. Starr is particularly bad during his big dramatic scene at the end of the movie. In addition, the moral tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual details, but he can't overcome the bad plays and the unintentional fun situations. Sol Politos camera work is strong. Somehow this piece got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
