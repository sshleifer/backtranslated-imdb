If you liked watching Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel, then you might like to see Burt Reynolds in another movie so bad that it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is better quality, but the movie's night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everything seems red. I first thought that my DVD players were shaken up. It wasn't. If you insist on seeing it, I recommend you adjust the color of your TV until it is black and white. If you don't, you will never be able to get through the movie. If you do, just remind yourself that a poor movie student is trying to revive the Pulp Fiction style.
