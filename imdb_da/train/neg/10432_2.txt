Terrible end - and I can't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to pencil in just three weeks. It was actually disappointing enough for me to discard my discs from the first 3.5 years. Now the first 1.5 hours were action packed, but absurd in the premise, and then it deteriorated into a slow, painful, sophomoric disintegration of the series. Amazing how slow and drawn the last hour was. Were we thinking more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in A-materialism, I would regain Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. Absurdly thinking 38K people would give up everything for a "fresh start". Absurd to throw in a missing Kara and a returning Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw in Mitochondrial Eve. Just absurd.
