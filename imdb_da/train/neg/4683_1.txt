As a former underwater vessel, this was one of the worst submarine movies I've ever seen. First and foremost, a murmur aboard an American maritime vehicle, especially a nuclear-powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is fantastic, and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the youngest crew member. I could never see a crew from any ship splitting their alliance between the captain and the director. A director acting as the character played by Denzel Washington would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed, then drumming from the Navy. It is no surprise that the fleet refused to send a technical advisor to help make this movie. Finally, if a member of a submarine member made the amount of noise started on this vessel, they would be heavily accused. Underwater vessels learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not sludge doors and even speak quietly and wear soft sunbathing shoes when they are in operation. I was amazed at how high they portrayed the crew along the way. High music would never be tolerated. By exhibiting submarine life in reality, I would not sell movie tickets, but it is above all to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
