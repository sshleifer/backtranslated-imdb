"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a rubbish. The play is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent, and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this piece of foam is that the majority of IMDb users gave it a 10. This is truly horrific. No one does, no excitement, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the supportive cast is also horrible. Yes, some people like this picture, especially a mainstream community, but hard core horror fans or gore dogs will not enjoy this piece of crap. Personally I hate horror comedies, I prefer watching serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "last house on the left". In my opinion, a real horror movie must be frightening, overly bloody and disturbing without silly humor, which usually destroys the whole concept. This one is not scary, is not gory, is not even fun as a comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
