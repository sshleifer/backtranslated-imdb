This is a movie that takes a little digestion. On the one hand, we are offered a hard outer shell, a story that not only fetches the Catholic Church, but makes it so silly and uninformed. On an inner layer we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis, and what happens when people blindly follow a belief that they must not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance this turned out to be a comedy. In that case, Mr Durang must open a dictionary because he obviously does not know the meaning of the word. The witnesses are pale; humor is awkward and poorly delivered. Especially Keaton's performance is fleeting and over the top, well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of strife, with her high tone and mocking style. All this could be forgiven if it wasn't in the last 20 minutes of this movie that was apparently a controversial game made in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Caution, front spoilers *** < br /> <br /> It all begins with the appearance of four former sister Mary Ignatius students (by the way, Ignatius is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it according to her promises under any circumstances merely because of the fact that only show you how much tireless research went into the project.) When they all admit that they do not live up to the teachings of the church, the sister continues to become irrational and abusing them in a way the audience is thinking she did way back then in the corny, all-too-clich√© sepia-tone flashbacks. When one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more violent until the student pulls a gun. After breaking it away from her, the nun kills the student, presumably in self-defense. She then goes on with a screaming rampage and kills a gay former student because of his sins. The last shot is the dead female student lying in a christian-like bag as a shadow of a cross hanging over her. Can you say `heavy hands? 'I knew you could! <br /> <br /> I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know that many people have been emotionally injured as a result, but this imagery is fed into our necks in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie. I have heard from the author and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodox so religiously, no saying is intended. However, this explanation is difficult to swallow simply because we never get an authoritative point of view that is not prejudiced against Catholic faith in any way. This film is simply anti-Catholic tripe, which in the name of justice and equality is medieval and hated. <br /> <br /> This is a movie I would recommend to a Catholic, to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they are facing today. If it were 'Rabbi Ray explaining it all' or 'Imam Muhammad explains it all,' there would be rioting on the streets and Showtime would lose all his subscription. But, unfortunately, because this is a film that goes against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same refined point of view. I certainly hope every member of this cast was a practicing Catholic, so it was not just ignorance that brought them to make this movie. I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive character, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and just a bad movie in general. Don't waste your time.
