The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least everything I lost was $ 3.00 and the time went by to sit through this bomb. The crew member responsible for the continuity missed the boat. When the woman leader and the FBI guy went to the alleged killer, Mr. FBI woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out of the door, the revolver has been magically transformed into an automatic. One is back to consider, would an FBP agent give a weapon to a civilian? I do not think. Mrs. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It is too bad that the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen. It seems that a movie editor cuts what might have been the best parts of the movie.
