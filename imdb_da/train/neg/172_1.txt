Back to the cottage by the lake is by no means up to the original. With only one protagonist (Stanley) returning to the sequel, the movie is not even worth 2 hours of time. I'm a big fan of the first movie, the story line and acting was really good, but it's a movie I will never see again. It's pretty much the same as the successors to Urban Legends and Blair Witch was like, but with much worse plays. Personally, I've seen better in soap operas, it's so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I do not recommend this movie to anyone and it will only detract from the first one.
