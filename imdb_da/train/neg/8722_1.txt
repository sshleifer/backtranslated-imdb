In order not to be confused with Lewis Teague's "Alligator" (1980), which is actually an excellent movie, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" ends the exotic trilogy Sergio Martino created around the late 70s Isola degli uomini pesce " and not so good "La Montagna del dio cannibale") Scary tracking of "Jaws" plot, failing the script by creating excitement anything. The creature is ridiculous and its victims are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's lame tune illusively the adventurous stupid tourists presented from the beginning as the obvious objects of the reptile's meal, no excitement from this, rather laughing actually! And we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the indigenous dialogues and appearance were not so obviously inspired by pure Racism Very soon, giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling, which shows such a disappointing attitude, we could apologize for badly crafted films and bad FXs, but not That kind of mentality. Never!
