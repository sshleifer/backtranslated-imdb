Robert Taylor proved himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun-waving buffalo hunter in this 1956 Western. It was one of the few times Taylor would play a heavy in a movie. Nevertheless, this picture was far from large as soon after that, Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives. Stuart Granger saved his British accent and became a formidable performance as Taylor's partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged, drinking old-fashioned who attended the hunt for buffalo too. In his early stages, Nolan really made an excellent start to Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Note Russ Tamblyn's appearance in the movie. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan will participate in the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> The writing in the film is stiff at best. At the end of the film, it is the elements of nature that made Taylor in. What about the elements of writing here?
