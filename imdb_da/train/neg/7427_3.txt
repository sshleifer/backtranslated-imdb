When a friend gave me a boxed set of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I was understandably a little careful. But when the item was a gift, I really didn't really pay much attention to my common sense. After all .... movies for free! So what if they are a little ropey. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first choice because it looked the best of the pile. All I can say is if this is the best of them, I scream to think about the rest. <br /> <br /> On the surface it had some good things for it. Four (count them!) Actors I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy have been in some good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5 respectively) so they didn't want to sign up for a turkey. Max is a veteran soap actress who never really managed to break into movie .... but not too lukewarm an actor ... a Jeff .... Well ... he has done the good and the bad in terms of film and television. "I soon had to find that Jeff had decided to add" the ugly "to his repertoire of movies. <br /> <br /> The first link was in the opening scene. Jeff wars his way with gusto through an "I'm Sour" scene before finally killing him. An entertaining cameo performance, really. Unfortunately this is the highlight of the film without much exaggeration. It goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the Mission Commander (Williams), who is sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his crew busy picking his new masters among the ranks of the criminal element. But this assortment is not so much the Dirty Dozen - more like the Unconvincing Fourth. Plus is one of the crims, a computer hacker, shown in his cell working away on a laptop. Isn't it a bit like letting a killer run a gun shop in slamming? Pretty Lame Prison if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they finally leave, the effects are really awful. It seems that the spacecraft model was turned up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year olds who had spare parts back from their Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But the horror doesn't stop there. While on the route to the area where Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by being given weekends in the virtual reality where they pamper their male fantasies. All good and good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to "Alien Menace", which begins to appear there. But did they have to pull it off completely sooo loooooong? Alien Intruder? Alien drilling, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally, they make it to the G-Sector, and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her feelings until only good old Max is left. The end, in really optimistic rattle movies, hints on a sequel - as if! Also, a look in this movie is a character I want to call the name "Sweatdroid". He was supposed to be an android, but it was apparently lost on the make-up herd, which gave him sweaty moves at every opportunity. But quietly, he's just there to deal with the number of counters at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggin, to be truthful, do very little in the movie. They are just about to stay awake, let alone act. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so his maneuverability doesn't tell much about the movie. Max tries his best, just like a few of the other cast members, but the movie is just direly horrible, to be honest. The one and only half way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship's naming convention. They are all named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is bland and uninspired. <br /> <br /> It was in 1992 that I thought it was one of the 80's straight-to-video jobs. It looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90s. It seems best. <br /> <br /> This is best avoided. Even as a beer n chips movie, this movie is a stinker, but at least you can speed it up, I suppose.
