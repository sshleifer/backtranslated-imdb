My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring and I thought it was just a repeat of things from "101 Dalmatians." I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The best part was the credits at the start - they were sweet and well finished. The rest of the movie is not worth seeing. Thank you.
