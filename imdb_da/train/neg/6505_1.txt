A confused root from start to finish. As they used to say about the Beatles, there was a secret message if you played the LP behind. If you had the patience to watch these movie scenes from the end to start, you would get away with the same degree of disappointment. Aside from all this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and fake starts, the clearest sign was movie makers, too vengeance if the movie wasn't sorted. Nor was there anything to like about these two. Overactive, shouting and threats were delivered in cartoon fashion. I think a dimensional was an overstatement. Okay, so maybe the artistic types roll their eyes upright in the fact that unlike them, the plebeians just didn't get it. Now I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad movie brought from start to finish. A non-existent and pathetic story line, if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, not a single character you cared for at least.
