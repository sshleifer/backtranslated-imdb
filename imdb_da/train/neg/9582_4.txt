This thrown together piece of fecal matter adds so many ridiculous scenarios that it is ultimately a grin of absolute hilarity. Too bad as the premise is promising (as is so often the case in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this screenwriter it says in la la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison for a DUI who killed his mistress. We'll see him having nightmares just because we know he feels really bad about this. Then his cell-mate hangs next to himself. Or does he? Lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly. His suspicions are so weak that the evil ones have nothing to worry about. So why do they set him up to be killed? Oh, this is where the story can be interesting. This is where it falls off the rails, and when it is off the rails it decides that it can get away with insulting viewers' attention for the next numb hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I will not drill with an endless tale of the irrational of what follows, but consider this end. Lowe has been caught by the evil on a train. They want a ribbon that he has for the ribbon to screw their boss and them. So on to the train comes 3 police, weapons drawn, ready to save Lowe. The bad kill the police, in front of half of the passengers and then .... continue chasing Lowe to get the tape. HI!!!! kill 3 police publicly will get you to deep doodo, to hell with the tape. Still, they go through a mall that pops up on the spot, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and ultimately, the Lowe guy is and the bad guy will still have the tape !!!
