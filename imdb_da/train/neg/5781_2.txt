Roman Polanski has made many, many films that are unexceptional. His fame regrets me. Nothing stands out as a highlight except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he made to film was made more than twenty years ago; His work is just embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). R's Baby must have meant the end of the business at the time it came out. It is a lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 horror movie (never showing the baby). But this is just misguided fear. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line is hopelessly clear very early (Um, thank you for the final devastating title), and on a clear day you can see that the twist ends for days. It did not support my interest. I find out that whatever this movie might have been, it's completely traced to the 1960s version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronically distracted, helpless waif / housewife. Her weakness is oversold ... she is annoying at the extreme. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. Dakota is barely exploited for the eerie potential.
