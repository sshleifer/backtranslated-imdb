I hired this movie expecting a few laughs, hopefully enough to keep me amused but I was very wrong. This movie showed very small moments of humor and the pathetic jokes made me frighten with shame forever to rent it ... The purpose of a 10-15 age group, this movie will surely let viewers outside these borders feel very dissatisfied . Worth not more than 3 votes very unrecommended for anyone who does not want to waste 2 hours in their life.
