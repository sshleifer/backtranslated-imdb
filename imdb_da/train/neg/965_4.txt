At first I liked that movie. It seemed to me a nice comedy with some stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best !!! The same as the wonderful set of decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But the screenwriters disappointed me a lot. The best end would be the stage on the ladder, but instead it decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Don't like the end. The father becomes the girlfriend of her own daughter, and his former wife knows it and finds it okay. It would be ok if, for example, the manuscripts would say there is another soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was a lot of fun in the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments even spoil the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, who played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), She was true to him, she loved no one but him, and when she met him and was just about to love him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she easily betrayed the man she longed for many years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end, and some missing human psychology.
