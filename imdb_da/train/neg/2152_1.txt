This movie tries to be extremely clever and Tarantino-like <br /> <br /> before trying it yourself, but you need solid cinematic basics. These include good sound, editing, set design, etc. ... <br /> <br /> can talk about the sound of this movie. absolutely horrible. I have never been more distracted by a soundtrack ever <br /> <br /> and before we talk about low budget, movies made in Chile, etc. Let us remember that desent sound these days is far more achievable than ever has been. everywhere. And more info on technology is available so ever before <br /> <br /> The sound of this movie is simply poor. foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate the whole atmosphere is just as horrible. I heard at least four loud clicks under the movie, which is the result of poor sound editing. The sound within cars is horrible, the sound of car doors is terrible. The sound of the lady song is wrong. foley is either overboard, or simply not there as the sound person just bored and gave up. the rooms are wrong. Everything about it is wrong <br /> <br /> And yet, don't let creativity limitations get in the way, while the movie bravely tries to be clever. For example, the aquarium sound is used in the following street scene. We hear sound when we don't have to. audio edits prior to visual cuts. every trick in the book is used, and the reasons are just not there <br /> <br /> editing-wise we have scenes using powerful cuts, we have tinkering around with the timeline etc etc, yawning. All these techniques are mimicked to an excellent low standard <br /> <br /> All in all, the mix is ​​crap, the sound is crap. And then the movie is crap. How can a movie with so many basic errors be considered at prices and high praise? Chile's cinematic new wave? the best creative production that Chile has to offer? I hope not and I do not believe. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's more selective and better talent avoided this movie as the plague perhaps because of its risqué content. Likewise, the film has probably received so much unjustified critical recognition from so-called 'world-cinema' enthusiasts for the same scary reasons. They probably jump in it's trashiness. Of course, film critics are rarely aware of technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. It's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a 6.8 rating. The movie has the entire production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porn!
