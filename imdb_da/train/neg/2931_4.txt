Sitcom "Gentlemans League" follows the lives of several bizarre residents of the fictional village "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked together by their common attitude. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show shows the main plot a new road to be built through Royston Vasey. Therefore, several foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" store who are actually far away from the city, do not like foreigners. When a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are tasteful and not at all fun, for example, when the couple takes on two engineers who want to build the new road. Edward drums, while Tubbs dances half naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> In addition, Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local job center. Although Pauline hates the people she's going to work with, the woman won't lose her job. So when a vacant man gets an interview as a fireman, she doesn't allow him to go because he's not ready for the job yet. <br /> <br /> There is Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes in great detail about "her" sexual transformation. <br /> <br /> The vet, Mr. Chinnery also kills animals instead of healing them. In one case he comes to a farm and is led into the living room, where a dog is in his basket. The farmer goes outside. On the assumption that the dog is the sick animal, euthanizes. Chinnery. A second later, the farmer opens the door and holds the "real" sick animal, a sheep, in the hand. <br /> <br /> Some more residents are a man and his wife who are visited by their nephew (his friend is killed by shop owners, by the way). The couple are very tidy. For example, they have towels in different colors. Each color represents a part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and precisely classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. By playing women, the scenes become comical. The costumes are also suitable for the actors. Tubbs have a scarf and some crazy characters, such as Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a lot of dark humor, typically British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses are gray and overdue. Around the local store there is often fog that strengthens the threatening effect. Even the village sign is vicious: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors do a good job, this type of series is not my taste.
