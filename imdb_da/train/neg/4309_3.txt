Unfortunately, a high school leader (Keenan Wynn) with a losing basketball team is holding a coach who turns out not just to be a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby), but a catalyst for their new winning ways. Are you really surprised? Along the way, a romance grows between the coach and the team's star player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never informed. <br /> <br /> Packed with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie, this movie really does not service. This can easily be edited in a TV movie this week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randy Rawlings especially in his skimpy outfits, but I expected more than just titration from an R-rated movie. A side plot involves a dorky center hypnotized by his teammates to believe he is former NBA player Sydney Wicks, the real cause of the team's new success instead of Cathy Lee's coaching. Too much right and not enough sleaze makes this a big disappointment.
