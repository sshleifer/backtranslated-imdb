I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? Did he die during filming and the studio should dub the sound with someone who does not even look like him? Or was the sound on DVD destroyed? After approx. 10 minutes you finally hear the actors' real voice. Although it all in the movie sounds like the sound was recorded in a bathroom. I would be ashamed to give a copy of this movie to Goodwill if I owned a copy. I rented it, but I never do that again. I want to check this database before renting more of his films, all of which were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you got when you saw a Steven Seagal movie. I think it's no more.
