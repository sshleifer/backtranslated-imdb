Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that can be clearly distinguished. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda", where all characters speak with Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and views that are not related to anyone outside a four block radius where Allen lives. They also share the same curious condition for affording millions of dollars of Manhattan apartments that are apparently designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do to live. <br /> <br /> The only character that exists outside this boring mindset is Will Ferrel as the mandatory Woody Allen surrogate. Even though he doesn't just come out as making a Woody Allen impression (like Kenneth Branagh in the scary "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that Real Woody had when he played the party itself in his best movie. The end result is another in a series of self-indulgent drills from a once great filmmaker who has acted on his previous reputation for years.
