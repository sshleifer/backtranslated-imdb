I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even boring than when I first looked at it. I do not understand why it has become such a "cult classic" when it is so boring boring. The opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the blood vessel and runs for his dear life. After all that really happens, the merchant stems around some forests and houses while having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The make-up is quite good, and his melting-haired face looks pretty realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a man's head in a river and it flows until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts openly. There's not much to wet yourself, most scenes are shot in the dark and you can't really see what's going on. There is not much to do, at least in the Vipco DVD I saw. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melting Man is not that big at all. I give it grades for its cheese factor, but it's about it. If you want a SAND sci-fi / horror cult classic, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
