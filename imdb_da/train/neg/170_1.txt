Viewers throwing everything, including the title sequence (now it's fun) wanted us to believe it's a kind of movie miracle, but trust me people, it's one of the most embarrassing bad movies you could ever see And if you don't laugh at it for five minutes, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays a doomed and bravado-obsessed RAF pilot who somehow thinks it is appropriate to engage in an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, as he overturns its definite and burning death. (Isn't it romantic ...) Of course he is spared of a nice metaphysical chance and washes up the beach, just like the same air traffic controller leads on the bike. (They look immediately). <br /> <br /> Looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtitles (so over the top, you really should refer to them as super-texts, from a naked boy sitting in the sand and playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on its little whistle, for a heavenly command so that campy / queen-y his makeup is caked more thoroughly than the ladies), the most bizarre aspects of the film are how it weaves bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a marvelous attempt to argue for some point about the universal nature and power of love. We get it - fly boys as girls in skirts and heels, and girls like them back, and apparently all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb .. . <br /> <br /> In terms of production quality, continuity / editing is poor enough to cause cringing, and the lighting may be even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor (what suits the sky is in black and white, if you can figure out the senses in it) and foreclosure (so funny do my fellows who usually like movies like this, actually cheered and laughed when the doctor's motorcycle finally ended up in a burning wreck) and freezing movement (which is fun of all, because the women's leadership is so poor standing, you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera). <br /> <br /> The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but after that it's all alpine. The one (as an escalator moves) moves stairs is not least the Odessa steps, and I really want to be aware that someone feels they must see this lame attempt to make movies on their account. The movie is generally bad enough to be fun, and it's about the best I can say to it.
