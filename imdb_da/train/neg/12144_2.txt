Although nothing compares to Vampires Vs. Zombies ... in any area of ​​film making I will try to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breathable. When there was an explosion on the TV screen, I thought my whole house would explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells landed on the floor right next to me. Simply stunning my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene when Jack Black sound-a-like gives the worst monologue I've ever heard, I nearly killed but didn't worry when he was ripped off in the movie he can pass his horrible acting on "I must be tall". Seriously, he must have looked into thoughtless babbling about non-congruent thoughts, which makes absolutely no sense and merely added that he must be "tall" to justify his terrible play. Well, if you can say this to apologize for horrible action, so if you talked to the authors, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you'll probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked, I didn't put a missed shot in my mouth and ended my life after this shocking horrible excuse for a movie was played. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie, you'll need to be murdered <br /> <br /> Your true, <br /> <br /> The General
