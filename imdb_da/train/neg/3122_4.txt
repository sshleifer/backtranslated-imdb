I couldn't give this movie a bad rating or bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller, and there are some small disturbing elements that lean on the psychological, which was something the film could have focused a little on. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a narrative night time deejay who goes through personal issues: his lover moves out and Gabriel has what seems to be a case of the narrator's block. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered in his parents' hands. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem weird when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland might not even exist. I don't want to go into detail because I don't want to ruin the movie, but I will tell you this: it's pretty predictable. Fascinating atmosphere to tell a story and good performances by Robin Williams and Toni Collette, which I thought was the film's key person. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and most beautiful actresses. Her ability to tap into the psyche and the personality of the characters she portrays is very creepy, and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hell, I think she could pull out to get a best supportive actress nod to this if the script was a little better). The movie starts out as a psychological thriller, but a predictable one. If you are curious about knowing the movie's ending and twists, then watch the movie or else I would hire another predictable thriller called "Hide and Seek".
