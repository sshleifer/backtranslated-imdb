Although Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as the blonde lead, this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a couple of times (no nudity in 1954 when this movie was made, not 1965). <Br /> <br /> The guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles Bud Abbott of Abbott & Costello. Most of the other women are unattractive, and the drunk woman is half-entertaining in a scary way. A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvy physique, but you can't judge any trading talent because the whole movie is post-dubbed. Some of these "exercise films" that are usually made later than this one are somehow interesting, but it is really a drill party. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) directed. There are some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting occasions, but there is really nothing here.
