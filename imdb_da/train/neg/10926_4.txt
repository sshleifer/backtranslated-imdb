While the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, performance is usually lacking. While the practical mummy effects are not bad and the "Gun Nut" character is above the top giggle inducing, the only real move is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen. I suppose it was the idea all the time. They do the best they can with what they have, but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena's character played some Tomb Raider style shorts. Not a high brow cinema I know but you can't refuse true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin is again ashamed of the guy you love to hate. If you just want to see a few of your favorite Firefly characters, have a good time with something under par, then it may be for you. If you want good acting and character development, it is recommended to look elsewhere.
