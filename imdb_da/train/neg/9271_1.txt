To the small minority seen here promising this movie becomes serious. I know it's down to people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can certainly see that this is totally rubbish. So bad, it doesn't deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume those who say how great it is, are friends with someone involved in the movie and try to give their career a boost. Bad in every way, don't tell people to say otherwise. Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries, script is also. Attempting to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not pamper the filmmakers' lack of ideas, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of scare. Absolutely no redeeming qualities, completely complete. I have awarded this pair of chances one mark, simply for having it exactly to get someone to fund this piece of crap. They must have put more effort into it than they did to actually make the movie. Shame.
