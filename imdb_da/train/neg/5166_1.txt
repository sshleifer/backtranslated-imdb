Horrible actress, lame plot, stupid story and just about horrible movie sums up this piece of junk. It was scary to sit through. Just awful. Don't waste an ear on this. The cinemas should feel bad about putting this movie out there for people to see. This "horror" movie was not even at least scary, scary or disturbing. It was by no means visually appealing. The act was so horrible by all the actors that any attempt to get into the movie through dialogue is completely destroyed within moments of the actor / actor opening their mouth. Plus the whole story, I don't know why anyone would make a movie with this story again. Don't waste your time or money. Although it's a free ticket, don't waste a moment watching this movie. You will feel stupid to see it.
