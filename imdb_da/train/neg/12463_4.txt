OK Hollywood is not liberal. Of course I lie because it is. I'm a conservative, but I want to leave politics my opinion about the movie. This film was anti bush, anti middle east, anti big oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist off, I'll give credit where credit is due. I watched this movie open night because I happen to like these kinds of movies and am a politically scientifically large collage. The cinematography was excellent and the play was as far as I could tell very well. <br /> <br /> The reason was impossible for me to decode. I have been tested and have an IQ of 138, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no way I could tie the movie's story line together and what characters did what. <br /> <br /> The story and scene sequence was completely incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless this is one of the movies to be seen many times to get the full depth of the story as it may well be, I have no idea exactly what was going on. <br /> <br /> It makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and do not receive any criticism, then your argument is impossible to criticize! If you can't dazzle them with shine, baffle them with Bull S.
