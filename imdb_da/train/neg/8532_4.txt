The songwriter Robert Taylor (like Terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and cannot look over other world-renowned Norma Shearer (like Consuelo). "She shines the sun even when it rains," explains Mr. Taylor. But Mr Taylor gets a lump in his throat as he approaches Ms Shearer. Finally, Taylor at Palm Beach Casino Shearer, "I Love You!" Shearer brushes him off when she is engaged to George Sanders (like Tony). But to settle a gambling debt, Shearer Taylor picks up as "her carton laws" to do Mr. Sanders zealous. <br /> <br /> This movie's title invites the obvious and appropriate record: "Her Carton Film". It is most remarkable as the last movie appearance for Shearer, one of the world's greatest stars from "He Who Is Beaten" (1924, playing another Consuelo) to "The Women" (1939). To be fair, it was probably the kind of Shearer movie MGM who thought the audience would see. However, the party is flattering. <br /> <br /> Picked and driven, Taylor and Shearer were better in "The Escape" (1940). If the shearer had continued, she could have become a better actress than "leading lady"; apparently she was no longer interested, and certainly did not need the money. Taylor has a fantastic scene reciting Christina Rossetti's "When I'm Dead, My Beloved" while threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Her Carton Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
