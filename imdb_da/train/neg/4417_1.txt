I am a Catholic educated in parish schools of nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but will not be considered a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes because I do not believe in certain things or act in certain ways just because the church tells me so. <br /> <br /> So back to the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun, which is supposed to be a satire like the performance of a female religious figurehead. There is no comedy in it, and the satire is not well done by Diane Keaton's overbearing action. I've never seen the game, but if it was very different from this movie, it might be good. <br /> <br /> I first believed that the gun could be a fake and the first shot a plan of the woman's leadership of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual credibility. But it turns out that the balls were real, and the story has tragedy ... the tragedy of loss of life (in addition to the two former students ... the lives of aborted babies, the pupil's mother), dogmatic tragedy of love for people, tragedy of organized religion that replaces true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
