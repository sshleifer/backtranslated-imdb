"John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!" I thought when I checked the girl's info here on IMDb late on a Saturday night, after finding myself watching the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished seeing it, and unfortunately it was downhill from there. You may not ruin a movie, this poor one, but I will leave the spoilers out of this review ... There is a horrible mass of style over very small matter: unfortunately, the style has not dated well for the eight years since its release. With regard to the substance, the film tries to make an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under the shining veneer, an externally meaningful or relevant argument fails. Characters are painted in childish broad lines that fall into the kind of generic stereotypes that the author's father tried to ask questions in the Breakfast Club. Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job that keeps up the pace (maybe it depends on some information that will soon become a tedious entity, but at least pushes the story together), but his efforts do not sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting (how you have to sit with 'Maddox' when Blake Shields gurns and slides through the part I just can't understand), not to mention the many gaping plot holes (I'm all for creative license but when the "evil" knows the identities of the "good" make their lives a misery but fail to act in any way to stop them, really wonder why this script has not gone through yet a few re-prints before production - has dad even read it?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure a younger audience can enjoy this movie (and all the power for them), but they're really better off with Hughes Sr.'s high school output and if The idea of ​​school-time rebellion is what reallion y appeal, the 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfying study of the subject.
