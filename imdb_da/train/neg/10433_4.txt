Fighting scenes were great. Loved the old and newer Cylons and how they painted them on their side. It was the only one I hated. I was disappointed that it was the earth, but 150k years back. But traveling all the way just to start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people who fought for their existence and when they come to paradise, do they surrender technology? No way. Sure they ate paper and ranked food, but it's over. They can live like humans again. They only have a good doctor. What should they do when someone has a toothache, it never has anything to feed ... yes right. No one would have made that choice.
