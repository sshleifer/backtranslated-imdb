I watched this movie during a Tolkien-themed Interim class in my sophomore year of college. I was sadly sitting close to the screen, and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy - everyone else laughed, but they were not in constant sight. <br /> <br /> Let's get it out: Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie owes something to Bakshi movies. In Jackson's version of the Ring's Fellowship, the scene where the black riders attack the empty inner beds is almost a complete copy of the scene in Bakshi's movie shot by shots. You can call this plagiarism or tribute, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities don't stop there. I won't do any research to find out what they are, for that would mean I have something against respect for this movie. I'm sure others have outlined the similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I have decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological way. If I have omitted anything else that offends me, it is because I am completely overwhelmed, faced with a host of failures (and high points, mediocrity). Due to the heavy use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a gentle and wise wizard, but a wildly fiery prophet of judgment (whose hatred inexplicably changes color once or twice during the film). <br /> <br /> * Saruman White is sometimes called 'Aruman' during the film without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reasons. <br /> <br /> * Sam is outrageous. The depiction of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbits are small as children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never introduced - they simply appear during a scene change with a sentence phrase. The movie is filled with blunt editing like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing joyfully as they jump through the road. One of the hobbits acquires a lute at least twice as large as he is behind the back - which was not visible before - and begins to stumble in typically fantasy bard mode, as they all break into "la-la-la" s. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn is apparently an Indian who is dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants), complete with a large square pilgrim belt buckle. He is undoubtedly the worst sword master in the entire movie - often he gets a wobbly swing in before he is knocked flat on his ass. <br /> <br /> * The black riders seem more like lepers than threatening evil instruments. They lag everywhere, they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be safe, but not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the black riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen (where they stare at Frodo, which is on the other side of the horseback) continues forever, during which time the riders rear their horses on a guard threatening way and ... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline when he subjected his wound. It turns out to be more plodding than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the Dwarf is as high as Legolas the Elf. He's a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for that. He also resembles a bastardized David the Gnome. It is a raw but precise description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have pilfered Elmer Ford's golden Viking armor from the Bugs Bunny opera episode. He looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * In spite of the similarity with Tolkien's illustration, Balrog is cave-making and the least threatening villain throughout the film. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers, and it's hardly higher than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I will take Jackson's version some day. <br /> <br /> * The fighting sequences are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters show any degree of competence with their weapons. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movies, but they're supposed to fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short appearance and I was sorry that he was bothering to show up at all. Watch the movie, you want to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Now for the good parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some of the voting is pretty good. It's not that Aragorn SOUNDS bad, he just looks a bit like Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is something interesting in this depiction; like Tom Bombadil, she seems to be uncomfortable with the Ring's powers of temptation, and her voice actress is also not horrible. Boromir's death is not as heartbreaking as in Jackson's depiction of the same scene, but it's still appropriately dramatic (and more true to his death in the book, though I don't think Jackson made a mistake shooting what he did) . As my professor pointed out (between whispered threats), the orcs (mainly by Helm's Deep, if I am correct) resemble the soldiers' war-torn bodies, a political statement that works quite well if you realize what is being tried. <br /> <br /> * While this is not really a positive point about the movie, Bakshi cannot be attributed to most errors in this movie, or I have been told - the project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control over some of the higher-ups (which I certainly hadn't read the books). <br /> <br /> Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi for even trying once hung of this size. I simply have difficulty believing that he was satisfied with the end product. In general, I can by no means recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs unless you have already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. I'm sure someone, somewhere, will choose a copy of this in confusion; If you do, keep an open mind and pick up what you like.
