The good reason to see it in the cinema was that it was a sniper, otherwise I would never have seen this horrible teen slasher movie. I think we haven't got enough of it yet? Screaming and scary movies at least didn't take them seriously! The plot sucks, and the play is the worst I have seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie competing to be the worst I've seen in the cinema with this one.) <br /> <br /> There are so many plot holes in history and girls are so even that you are not even now who has been killed and who does not. (and you don't care). The only one I had known before was Denise, and she was the most talented minor actress I've ever seen in this bad film excuse. far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
