as an actor I really like independent movies, but this one is at best amateur. The boys go to Vermont for a civil service, but when the plane lands, it flies over a palm - were the directors aware that Palmer is not in Vermont? Pine trees yes - palm trees no. And the same for the wedding service - again lovely grove of palm trees. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they couldn't seem to get a ticket on a major airline, as the plane being filmed is Federal Express. Do they ship at night in a box? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi movie from totally amateur. The Christian brother is far more than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> The minor characters are ridiculous and take on something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause to the directors for making a gay movie, but pay attention to your rankings and casting next time
