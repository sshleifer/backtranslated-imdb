I don't expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the line lower than you would for the midget limbo for any TBS movie with Antonio Sabato Jr. yet managed to disappoint and failed to be a good-bad movie. <br /> <br /> Every scene was rotten as if someone had cut and inserted scenes from a dozen movies and TV shows dealing with large business conspirators in the script, leaning back and saying, "My work is done". It's all clich√©s, all predictable, and even worse, the actors are forced to look as if they are taking it seriously (though the plot development is ridiculous). Do yourself a favor. See "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let everyone know that being seated through "Wrong Error" is just that.
