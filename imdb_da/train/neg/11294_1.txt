Okay, I've been a big fan of the variety for a long time and was unhappy after seeing this movie. Let's mention the problems ... First, this movie has many of the same herds that the first two had. It has also been called PREQUEL for the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they cannot properly get the name of Shetan's lady or her color ?? In The Black Stallion Returns we learn Sagr was Black's CHESTNUT mother and in this movie she's a grayer name Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it is in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first was also set in the 1940s when the ship wrecked. The timeline doesn't sound right to me. Also, as a goof, there is a friesian at the beginning of the movie, which should be Shetan's father ... by further notice it seems to be a gallant. Ben Ishaak is the only character to make this movie seemingly related to the two previous ones in any way. Can be a sweet family movie for some, but this is my biggest movie restoration of the year.
