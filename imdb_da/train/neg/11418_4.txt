Joel Schumaker manages the manuscript he wrote with and has a group of Georgetown degrees faced with adult life situations. The storyline is an encrypted root, but some scenes are actually good. There is much wasted talent and time here. Cast is more impressive than the movie. Featured are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite contradictory. Being in age is not so marvelous.
