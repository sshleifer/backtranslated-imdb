To begin with, "Hobgoblins" are trying to monkey the more successful "Gremlins". It's bad enough, but they don't even try to do something that looks like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a dealer basement, all-must-go clearance of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound FX that seems as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything people keep sacred in their movie and throws it into it old pipes -aroo. <br /> <br /> The reason? Grrrr .... Meditation kids track gremlin-like creatures from the movie party before killing people by projecting their fantasies. Sounds cool, does it? Well, see the wall on the other side of your room? Drive right there, top speed, face first. Look, it's smarter than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare doubt? Quick, name something else, one of the leaders has been in nothing but this. What other scripts have the authors made since "Hobgoblins"? Name another Rick Sloane direct bet. How many "Hobgoblins" action characters do you have? See? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I took so long to write about such a horrible movie. I'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" is it and it's bad - bad as your grandparent's wallpaper, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as underwear that says "Home of the Whopper" ... and I think we will stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight bravely, but try as they might, they can only do so much with "Hobgoblins" before they realize that yes, the director needs the kick in the skin. br /> <br /> Real, really hard. <br /> <br /> A star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
