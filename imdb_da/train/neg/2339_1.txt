This swirling movie looks more like a combination of music clips on MTV than as a real movie. There is no real story, and when the film continues, you ask yourself, "What is going to happen?"; but nothing happens. The story of Eric Cloeck, the frustrated author, is the only good thing. The other people do not seem to have anything in common: So why bring them together in a movie. With music you can watch the worst movie. When I open the tap and water comes out with Bach's music, most people want to watch it, but it's not a movie. The director should learn to write a script for a movie in 100 minutes or more before starting to film a movie.
