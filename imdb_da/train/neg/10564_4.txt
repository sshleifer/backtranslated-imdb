The real shame of "The Gathering" is not in the bad acting, nor is it in the despicably low ground. The real shame is that it was far worse than the series it started, even though it had a main attraction: Takashima. I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even in just five minutes. She has the sarcasm, the white, the double angular personality that is at the same time fleeting and lovable. Unfortunately, the "Babylon 5" pilot movie has an incredibly boring story involving murder. Patricia Tallman - who never seriously returned to the series until much later - fortunately much better with the age as Lyta Alexander, who is a bit more than a whiny and tiring telepath. I have to leave you with a final mindset - why is it that Delenn looks like a kind of outer space doctor (though she is a woman)? Thanks heaven for the way Minbari looked later on the show.
