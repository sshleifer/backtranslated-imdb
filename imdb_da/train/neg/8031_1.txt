The American human association, which is the source of the well-known disclaimer "No animals were injured ..." (AHA's registered trademark) began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to jump to his death from the top of a rock for a shot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the terrible act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this movie for me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse did not die in vain, as it was the beginning of the public waking up to the dull and terrible pain that the animals caused for filmmaking, but I cannot help feeling me that if the poor animal had a choice, it probably would not have been the way he would have taken!
