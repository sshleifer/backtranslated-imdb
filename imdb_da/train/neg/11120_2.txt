You know that a movie is bad when the highlight of it is able to see a brief moment on "Jeopardy!". <br /> <br /> The scary thing about white men can't jump is that it had huge potential. For several years I lived in an area that looked like it in this movie; Race tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre play and poor manuscripts in white men cannot give Job anything to want. <br /> <br /> The order of the movie is arranged cyclically. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returns to his home and lounges with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories build on a climax of some sort, but "climax" I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (in this case "Billy either wins or loses money playing a game of basketball"). <br /> <br /> In order for a plot to evolve, some dilemma must be solved; And this dilemma must be interesting if the film becomes interesting too. Apparently, the white men's authors cannot skip forgotten this rule, as the plot can be summed up as "Billy must pay the bills". I appreciated the change of pace from other formal sports films, but - sorry - it was just awful. I could have looked less if Billy made the money pay the rent for his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump can be a successful movie. Apparently, some adamant sports fans will reject horrible writing for a couple of scenes with a basketball in them. Others I am sure was the cover of the big names that played the leading roles. This lets me wonder if the cast was completely replaced with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced by lacrosse, would anyone have bothered to watch this movie? I really don't think so. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie two stars out of ten; The extra star is for "Jeopardy!" scene that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
