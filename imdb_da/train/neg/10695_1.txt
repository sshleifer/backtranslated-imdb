... Okay, I've read about this movie somewhere on the Internet, and many criticized how bad and sucking this movie was. And I couldn't have agreed more about that. Then after I watched this movie on DVD, I thought twice about this and then came commercially from this movie on TV. Fortunately, I saved my money for these pieces of shit. I sacrificed my sleep for this movie and soon it turned out that this movie couldn't make me happy. So I can't judge how the movie was made, yet it still sucks. As for those who liked this movie, I would apologize for flaming this movie and telling how sucking this movie is. I don't know what do you think about this movie?
