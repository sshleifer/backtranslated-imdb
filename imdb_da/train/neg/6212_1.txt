It used to me to think that movies required plots or other ways to make you caring about the story or something going on. This movie has shown me that you don't have to have something like that. <br /> <br /> I could sum it up just like that. But IMDb wants me to have several lines. It was a little beautiful. not convincing at least. How the characters speak in the movie makes you think it should have happened within a few days, but there is no time trial and I am absolutely sure it all happens in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to entertain yourself, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing it. It would be a much better use of your time. Time you never come back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled off better than this movie.
