I totally agree with one of the reviewers here who was fond of "For The Birds", won Oscar in 2002 for "Best Animated Short", not this sick material, which is at least pretentious and appealing to anyone Of course, who has no faith in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but there are also many animated shorts. And by the way, I love dark humor, but it was just unappealing from the start. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story here: A guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but gray (symbolism here) is told by a television set (which appears every few hundred meters away) that he is in either heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he puts a gun in his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I think it would be fun in two of the three cases.
