MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Picture format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> Following an episode of sexual abuse in the hands of a trusted neighbor, young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) she meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has secrets of himself, no less uneasy and far more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Dour drama, triggered by brave notions by Harrison and Whishaw, where two related spirits immerse themselves in a common love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the 'real world'. Unfortunately, their friendship breaks out as a harsh reality begins to interfere, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the film looks out in places (for many awkward close-ups and dulled hand-held camera movements) and takes a while to find the feet, but the dramatic yields are quiet and rewarding.
