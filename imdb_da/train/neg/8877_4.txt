'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This movie doesn't have much to offer, but it gives more fun moments worth watching. Don't expect it to be a memorable movie. Just expect to laugh at the movie and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the lumpy boy was fun, and that's really all I remember about the movie, except for the boys who want revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a good movie, and it's probably best seen on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
