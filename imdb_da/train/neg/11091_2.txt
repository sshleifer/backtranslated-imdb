Denzel is all about the right thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps at an early stage, this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut some actions and plot points at the beginning of the movie, giving most of the story within the first 5 minutes. It and destroys what is preferably built up in rhythm and rhythm that the film may have had before. <br /> <br /> So first it confuses you, and then it breaks you down. The dramatization pushes beyond the suspension of disbelieve. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this may be able to infuse viewers. Granted, it does, so if you're looking for it ... knock yourself out.
