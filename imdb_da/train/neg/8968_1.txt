The screen writing is so stupid, it makes me bad to have wasted 2 hours in my life, I never come back (where have I heard it before). The action is uneven. Things often change enough to keep you able to see and wait for something cruel to happen. Nevertheless, there is not a single original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie that didn't make much sense at the end, the cube has zeroed in on it and tries to retell exactly the same story, except this time making it an unpleasant attempt to try to give explanations to every detail that the first movie did not match. The comic thing is, the director reuses the exact scenes of the first movie that was something weird and tries to explain to them. But the scenes are just copied, there is no connection at all. This script is so pointless. I can imagine that it will be written by some 15 and 15 years old with a baseball cap and a beer package for a class project. The best part is, in the end, they cringe the 'good' wunderkind guy and he becomes the delayed guy in the first movie and you see him when they find him ('this room is green ..') in Cube 1997 Hello, clapping flap, what a twist. First of all, what about, if you haven't seen the first one, it doesn't make any sense, you nitwit director. Oh, another good idea: Instead of the numbers to identify x, y, z coordinates of the space (cube 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. You h. Apart from the fact that permutations do not make much sense, he lets the letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want my money back. I think I had to write it down as there are just so many bad, inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / authors should be required to possess some talent.
