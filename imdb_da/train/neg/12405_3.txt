Shame on it! There I was, comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant hoping for another amazing Muppet evening entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this? The humor was terrible, the songs were worse than country and western (and that says something) and the plot was so confused and poor as a blindfold. I think the main problem was that they were beating too much in the attempt at Treasure Island. A short story, such as. Christmas Carol is perfect because you can weave the Muppet high jinks around it .... here is the need to pull the plot together stopped all the fun. Where's Muppets next? What about the Muppets Wizard of Oz?
