Absolute trash can. The reason why this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The supposed star did nothing to solve the case - nor anyone else really - it was just routine policing. Absolutely boring. <br /> <br /> Just sat to the end of the hope of a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There were so many opportunities to have a relative in apparent kidnapping. Could Lt's personal involvement finally clarify his sentence? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were that a stranger did. But surely a genius like Lt C, with constant conversation with the rejected man, will eventually uncover a jailed plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle tracks. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
