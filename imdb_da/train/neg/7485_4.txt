Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and you will find out. <br /> <br /> In reality, Martin's management is misunderstood. He does not make the big slapstick he is known for, from movies like "The Jerk", but instead plays a kind of between character that doesn't work. Hawn, with no one playing, is terrible. Cleese is the only partially fun member. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty stupid. I can't say how much it may have changed, but the signs seem to lack the smallest part of common sense. They blunder through New York, do nothing right, and unfortuneatly, nothing fun. Not only is the whole assumption incredible, it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, instead of seeing this, rent the original "Odd Couple" again.
