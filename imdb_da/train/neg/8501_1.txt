<br /> <br /> This movie is great time. It reminded me of the movie resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found very boring. And "Semana Santa" is an even poorer movie in every way. <br /> <br /> Only fine one in the cast does something for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old ladies in European film history. I loved her maniacal appearance in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I don't want to spend more time dealing with this movie. I would say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
