So this movie has really enjoyed Gregor's girl many years ago. This was drivel. The ground was vaguely uneven with the teacher and his friend perverted over 14-15 year old girls in very short skirts. Earlier commentators seem to think it's not something, but I found it pretty nasty. If you have children in school then the last thing you want is to think that all young teachers are cheating on their students. We were surprised that the censor let it through. Apart from that, the movie was just a waste of time. The script was poor, and John Gordon Sinclair was trying too hard to recreate his schoolchild, a little off the wall. Why anyone would like him in this performance is incredible. This movie failed for me at all points. Terrible. Don't waste your time watching it. Life is to short
