Quote: Theurgist: Anyone with an I.Q. over 50 would have seen this movie what it is, an intelligent well-traded prequel to a modern classic, yes it does not have a huge cast or a big budget, but it is still very well done and had me connected for the whole duration. <br /> <br /> An IQ over 50 tells you .. it means most that you have an I.Q. lower than 50 .. its name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! That means it should have something that is the first thing to do. <br /> <br /> Everything and everything is an OK movie if .. You change the title and no features called CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps doesn't comment on a movie if you don't know about movies. but I think an I.Q. under 50 ,, you don't know what the hell i shout for ... <br /> <br /> Peace out !!
