I just watched the movie in theater. The film has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a few songs can be. That is it. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the movie is disappointed, even Mumbai Indians also (right now Chennai has made it to the semi-finals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Now, Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood action scenes. But they forget that Hollywood directors have a great impact to make it look right. But unfortunately, Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spend their time on songs and advertising the movie. Now, such stupid action scenes can work in the south, as the audience just pays to watch their favorite actor kill a lot of people. But in Bollywood it certainly won't work. All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded. Eventually, some Chinese appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The audience doesn't pay to see such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget about the action movies. They can't do it. The last good act I've seen was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really upset by action movie fans like me. Do these people see their movie after completion? Can't they figure out that the slow motion action (made by rope) is too unrealistic and childlike? Better not having action scenes if you can't do it. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era, where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective these days, but visually it is much better than the current era scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie will now open the eyes of the Bollywood film directors. Don't do more action movies until you get art to make it realistic.
