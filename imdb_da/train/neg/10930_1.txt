This movie is a total dog. I found myself struggling to find something to laugh at, so I would not feel that I had completely wasted my money - and my time. The scripture in this film is absolutely horrible. It's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies. They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly utilized for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering what the meaning of most of the plot was - including the subplots. After watching this movie, I'm back with the impression that the producers hoped to capture some sort of Napoleonic Dynamite-like humor where it's not so much the lines as character and delivery. Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the lines, signs, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
