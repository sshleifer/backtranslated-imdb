Firstly, I apologize for giving a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). The film fails in every department, be it manuscript, direction, characterization or action. <br /> <br /> 1) Initially, the name of the movie is really C class (though the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character, but the weak script combined with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay, Gabbar Singh has 50,000 rewards on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag, the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had only a few men's bikes to commute (with all automatic weapons). To make a Sholay as a movie in Mumbai type setup in modern times does not look convincingly 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone needs to tell her she can't act. Why does Ram Gopal Verma cast again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are amazing actors are wasted in the movie. 7) Legendary role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is cheaply replaced in this movie by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu you must grow up and understand that there must be some intellect in your movie. Plenty of silly characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Shouldn't say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..patient to the greatest extent. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comical translation of the original classic. Don't waste time and money on this movie. I think seeing Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than seeing this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable directions. Thank you, Saurabh
