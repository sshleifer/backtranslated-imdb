Disappointing and unthinkable boring true crime film that has the badly cast character actor Jeremy Renner longed through Jeffrey Dahmer's title role, which was easily one of last century's most recognizable degenerates / serial killers. Posted directly to video back in early 2003, "Dahmer" is a blatant, dull, badly acted, and almost bloodless snoring feast of a sand crime drama that never really kills the bad and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like that had the great potential to do! What it does, however, tries to make for reasons unknown to me evokes some kind of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him as being ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and seriously socially grim homosexual loser which simply looks for love at all the wrong places as opposed to the cold, calculating and depressing sicko and madman that he was! All in all, 2003's "Dahmer" is one that sand crime buffs everywhere can just as well jump because I'm not talking when I say it's one of the worst serial killers ever made! It's even sorrians than other pathetic and exploding straight-to-video waste like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
