Certainly not the animals or Eddie Murphy had anything to say worth saying. This movie is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's movies? Well, if you try to make them take a nap, then maybe. It is only 90 minutes of some eye-catching poor vagabond animation for quips that are not fun. And lip-sync'ing makes the old Godzilla movies look great in comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie kills "Pluto Nash" Murphy with a suppressed undervalued delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently he tries to change his old manic persona, but to what? In short, all the magical and weird in the 1967 original version is lost in this re-show or whatever it is. A city wants to bully some forest animals and accuse them of doing bad things. No really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Thing the chain along with some stale jokes for a dull uninspired conclusion without surprises. Rent '67 movies. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
