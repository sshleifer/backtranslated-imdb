For those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, here's your chance and then come back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who saved the gold in the first movie told Twitch he is being transferred to another prison where wrestling champs hang around and look broody. Twitch plans to leave the prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets shot and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is caught all over, so he and scratches go to find her and Twitch's woman. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the actor is under par, it has a lot of (really annoying) rap music and badly edited combat scenes. On the plus side, it has the Spanish Spanish in what stars in each prison / action / thriller ever made, and he closes a door in this. It is not very eventful, but at least it is harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a massive fan of the original, it's okay. <br /> <br /> If not, you've been warned.
