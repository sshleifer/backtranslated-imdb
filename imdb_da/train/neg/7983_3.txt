Overall, have overlaid and filled with more patches than Swiss cheese holes! The director and co-author say he would mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two are mixed as vinegar and oil. To start, the comedy is not very fun and young. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Freedom is taken with regard to the legal system of committing French citizens to their will and the apparent ease of renouncing drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home and found myself yelling at the movie to move on. Finally towards the end, I quickly jumped to the final long speech, which one of the main characters makes to his ex-law's son. At that time, I was worn by the confusingly confused plot dealing with a dead lover, the charity expert, and a nutty ex-lover. At times, the plot diverts to the families of the two protagonists and returns to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the public, the views of Nora and Ismael are changed, her ex-laws confined themselves to his will at a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, none of which are well developed. The epilogue doesn't really pack many of the subplots and seems to see the viewer that somehow Nora will find happiness, even though, in view of her circumstances, she is in fact equivalent to a snowball chance in hell. The actors do their best and are appealing, but it is not enough to overcome all the sharp errors in poor writing, editing and lack of focus.
