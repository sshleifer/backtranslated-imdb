The scriptwriter was trying hard to recreate the "Exorcist". But put in a blah-blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged. There is no substance at all in this movie. It had the potential to be something special but it blows it by showing a bunch of people going beyond things that nobody cares about. Extremely boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this, but the stupid movie tickets were expensive so I had to resist the sad torture that felt it lasted forever. Nothing on the screen is relevant to what the characters were talking about. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here, instead of betting (as I meant to hate CGI) destroyed the movie even more. Some people say this movie was horrible in cinemas because of how "thought-provoking" and "slow-paced-without-action-because it's an intelligent movie" it was. What is so intelligent or thought-provoking when history is basically about beautiful boy H Eath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and obeys his religion? Seems like an uninspired concept. Oh, and there is some mumbo jumbo about "sin-eater" (the movie was originally titled "sin-eater"). Lame concept, but the film took the bed-eater case too seriously, so the film became pathetic and misleading about how dark and intelligent it was. Yeah, I know there really were sinners in the Middle Ages, but this movie just makes it sound like cheesy. Nothing in the movie was done right, and I forget why I even bothered to watch this movie. If you want horror movies that actually have depth, see Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen or any of the Romero's "Dead Trilogy" movies. Nonsense dialogue does not correspond to intelligence, ordinary movie fans believe that (though the kind of people who think a ridiculous movie like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece). If you want an emotionally boring horror, see the order. This movie makes the church seem like a roller coaster ride.
