The movie trailer was interested in me enough to justify renting the DVD. However, the resulting film is absolutely grim! It is certainly not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it was horrifyingly close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the movie doesn't know what it will be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting as it deals with the pitfalls of mail order brides, but the film is a mess. What begins as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word I use on the most possible terms) then goes completely in the opposite direction and degenerates into a very dark and unpleasant misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only assume did this for the money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in just about every aspect. It's not fun, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just ugly. A movie to be avoided unless you absolutely have to watch Kidman or Chaplin in every movie!
