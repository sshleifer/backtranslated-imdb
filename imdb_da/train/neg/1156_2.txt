Seeing tenants has been an interesting experience for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen where I've been driving fast in parts of (not) action - and I can usually see everything from turgid action movies to serbo-Croatian indie and find them fascinating. <br /> <br /> The bearings are frustratingly sluggish and over-orchestrated. One of the main problems in the script is that there is a small realistic sign dialogue, except the sets of pieces where characters "collide" in a very structured setting (to make this work needed the film to feel more conceptual as it did not ). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; all seem to be two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worse for this is Bill Spears character, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very unpleasant and very unsympathetic. At one point I even stopped the movie because I was so annoyed by the character's aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery, the lack of any other personality stroke, except for the reactionary "on" interrupt (which eventually becomes very predictable) and I so desperately wanted that he should have some redeeming qualities. One reason for this jar, however, may be the film's nebulous time scape (supposedly the 70s, it feels and looks more early noughties). If it had been more secure in the 70s, his character could have been more understandable. <br /> <br /> The lighting of the film was also awkward. Throughout the way, the soundtrack tries to give a certain gritty, jazz-infused atmosphere that just didn't come out, largely because the set was too well lit. The tenants are an incredible movie for me. It does not portray real people or suggest any interesting ways to think of race, identity or the life of an author, whether they are white or black. <br /> <br /> I was weird with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; His creepy, clamorous and obsessive appearance would have lifted both the actors and the manuscript into something quite remarkable.
