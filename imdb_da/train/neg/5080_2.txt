This is a review of the guide, not to be confused with Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The guide is a film from the late 1980s about a serious silent boy's ability to play video games and go throughout the opening point. Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. The Wizard is the guy who attached 100 straps together and had a little child who drinks seaweed out of it. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got it all out of the way, let me say this: There really is no need to watch this movie. It is simply a 100-minute Nintendo advertisement designed to exploit Powerglove, the legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the sensible sense, because it seems that this movie was written over a weekend of a crack team of people who had never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Perhaps if the author and the director sat down and actually played some games together, they would realize that they were going to film total nonsense and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos. <br /> <br /> I hope this has been an enlightening experience for you. It's probably not been for me. In fact, I think I might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you are in the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz, all sitting on the shelf in a beautiful little row, give them all a miss and play Duck Hunt instead.
