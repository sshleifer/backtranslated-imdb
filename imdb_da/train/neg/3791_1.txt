I cannot vote for this because I would not see garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it is my bourgeois duty to help people stay away from this bin. Go to the forum on this movie and read where cast members are trying to act as if they are watching the movie for the first time. A guy even responds to himself with the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (by any means). If this is the company's second film, it must be better than the first. This means that the third movie should be much better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is how to distribute this trash with the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie this weekend is fine ... but don't try to market that garbage bin!
