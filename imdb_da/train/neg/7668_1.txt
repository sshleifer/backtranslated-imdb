The moment the previous one started, I knew we were having trouble! The priest is at best ridiculous. The story was even worse if possible. The act was stiff and the actors gave a sense of inexperience. You expect more from similar of Slater, Reid and Dorff. Lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I'm sorry I like Reid, but she was very incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff picked up a lousy movie to try to put their comebacks up. <br /> <br /> The continuity was throughout the movie. The creatures were not bad, but neither were they good either. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I want the ninety minutes of my life back. They can keep the money, but give me time! What a waste.
