There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie trailer. I try to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local movies, but I can't help but support the backlash against this movie. It is slow, boring and bordering on meaningless. Even the "almost cozy and credible moments" were immediately subjected to painful clich√©s and bad plays. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only dangerous in this movie. It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV soap, then it was carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. The bursts had to come up with an RA rating (rated Awful), but it hasn't changed my belief in local movies. Several good films come as long as more films like these are not made.
