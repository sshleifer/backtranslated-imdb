I almost only made it through an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was stolen and downward, right-circled worthy. The action was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempt to be dramatic, remains most expressive. His eyebrows are indicated by a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could just as easily have played the girl in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical gears in the plot most randomly, petal cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget. But attempts to create excitement and surprise through distracting cinematography are added to the unfairness. I get the feeling that the ending was witty and surprising, but it was paralyzed and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I were to compare the overall quality to something else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on par with NBC's Hercules.
