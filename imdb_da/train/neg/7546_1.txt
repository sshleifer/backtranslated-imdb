I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage, and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to see it at least once ... but believe me it is. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the old movie. .but why would they like to resume a movie like this. The very basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is that it should either have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This movie does not fall under any of them and remains just silly. I just kept watching the movie hoping it would be interesting at some point, but it never does. <br /> <br /> So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for Cage fans. You could probably do it on television.
