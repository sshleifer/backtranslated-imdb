Snow White, which just came out in Locarno, where I had the chance to see it, naturally refers to the world-famous adventure. And it also refers to cola. Finally, the true snow of the Swiss Alps also plays its part. <br /> <br /> Thus, all three aspects of the title are dealt with in this movie. There is a lot of dope on stage and there is also a bright, dark-haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all sorts of problems to get to her. <br /> <br /> But: It's not an adventure. It must be a realistic drama in Zurich, Switzerland (according to Tagline). Technically, the film is close to perfect. Unfortunately, a faint plot, predictable dialogues, a virtually unreal landscape and the mixed play add up to create authenticity. Then I was untouched as a spectator. <br /> <br /> And then there were clich√©s that drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled high class daughter - of course, the parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were so busy continually. Her best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steel worker and a housewife) live in a small flat, poor and happy - and unaware of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) From the French-speaking part of Switzerland (as is considered the economically less successful but emotionally better fraction of the country). He's having trouble with his parents. They are migrants from Spain who do not seem to accept his wild way of life - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And then, the drug dealer is obviously brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, even though a woman (!) only has her career in mind when exposing Snow White to artistic pornographic images on a show. <br /> <br /> This review does not need a spoiler to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot. As I like other movies by Samir, for example. "Forget Baghdad" I was very disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.
