"Cut" is a film about some movie students making a movie. It's a lot in the "Scream" form, an ironic, self-reflecting horror flip that at least falls down, because for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror movie, the same as the movies that refer to. But it wasn't without its charm. Well, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was great as the spoiled bitchy American actress who hates every minute of working with the amateur Australian movie crew. She was so convincing that it was tempting to believe it was not an act, even though everyone involved in "Cut" says she was lovely to work with. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. However, everyone else has waved between being ok and being terribly wood. Anyway, "Cut" has some laughs, a pair of gore pants (some of it surprisingly cruel), and ultimately ... just another bad horror movie.
