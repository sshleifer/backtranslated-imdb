I would first say that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand how it is to work on a film of its own length, so props to the filmmakers in that respect. I am too positive, uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world, and that things do not always pull out ... even for followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such overwhelmingly positive responses to the manifest Christian message; for me it was just that the performance was where the film fell on the face. A movie lives and dies on its history, and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, exposure aplenty and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least. I think a movie doesn't have to lap you over the head with its message to get the point across. I'm sure Kendrick's brittle. will improve over time and their storytelling methods will also. Maybe they could lead others' plays as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies aren't exactly my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Dreamsfelt, etc.) can inspire in many ways. If you would be interested in a PG-rated movie that inspires, Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill' gives a look. All the truth is the truth of God ...
