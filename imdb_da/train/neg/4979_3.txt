Why oh why can't anyone make a decent movie out of a legendary story? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf", I have been disappointed for a year. But I have to say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel" starring Gerald Butler) was far better than this one. One was a little disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What bugged me the most? Were they the useless plate elements they added without any particular reason (Human sacrifice? Senseless love interest?), Or the bad CGI, or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired play? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so terrible !!! And let's not even talk about the ridiculous armbue? <br /> <br /> And why they reminded us that Beowulf had 30 men's strength, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the film. He was thrown around by both monsters, he fought and stood on his sidekicks to save his bacon. Even when he beat the arrogant prince, he didn't knock him out. He was too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like that. This was certainly not the magical Beowulf in the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this positively, but I can't really think of an offhand. All I can say is, if you've ever read "Beowulf," you will be infinitely disappointed with this gloomy, inaccurate excuse for a fit!
