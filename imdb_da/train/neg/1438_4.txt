Well! What can you say? First, this adaptation is too long in 4 hours for the complexity (or lack thereof) of the plot. The actors really try hard to make any of this movie, but there is too little content available. The Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. Having seen Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The Extraordinary Gentlemen's League", Swayzee really doesn't make the character. This winchester-repeating rifle chap has no strength, stature, subtlety or humor needed for that part, and is upstaged by everyone, including witch doctor, who, incidentally, seems to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the prospects are pleasant, but there are stupid mistakes in cinematography. E.g. When the happy team arrives at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis and are just waiting for them to enter them. Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through, etc. I waited for Doug McClure to come at any time. In some ways I would wish he had. <br /> <br /> The Russian leader, who pursues Quatermain, is a shrewdly created stereotypical character who just shoots everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee does quite well as the sad father, returning to London, who is unable to get his son's custody. Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing. He is not able to wear the brave gentleman with a strong heart, experience of life and sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Hardly
