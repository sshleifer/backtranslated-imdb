I can't believe that such oblique, jingoistic material is passed on to the Americans as artificial material. Early on, from such narrative lines as "we want to make sure they play for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows the true face. The annoying way in which Irish Catholics appear to be hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and dull, is so poor a rendition of history as former American Westerners depicting the battle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of history is distorted by the stereotypes of Irish Catholics and complete vilification in history; a corruption granted by the filmmakers themselves! It is boring that today people still think they can win morally weak by making a movie so easily recognized for the obvious purpose, so far from trying art. This movie has no business anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.
