To be honest, I haven't seen so many Western films, but I've seen enough to know what a good is. This is by far the worst western on the planet today. First there are black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought this could be a cooling off of the wall film that everyone would love was a little, no no, totally retarded! Second, in that day and age, women were especially black women not inclined to wear and or use weapons. Third time with the Asian chick speaks perfect English? If the setting is western, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the evil gay chick was too much, the movie was just shit from the beginning. Now don't understand me, I'm not racist or white, nor get ticked after reading this, but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
