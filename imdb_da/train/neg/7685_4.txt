Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark leads up on a nice, exclusive rural nervous asylum, where his loose wife fights with self-proclaimed Queen Bee Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself gets the hideous eye for the beginner, novice Lauren Bacall, who puts her life back together after the death of her husband and children. Facetious and muddled, set in a discriminating time and place, and with a "David and Lisa" love story tucked into the sumptuous morass. Widmark and Bacall have a good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. In just one hour, most of the dialogue is about the curtains hanging in the library (this thread is not used as symbolism, but it is a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture is hoping to show the loggerheads that different people come to work in the same profession, and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the route where Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative, informative nor entertaining. ** from ****
