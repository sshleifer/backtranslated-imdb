SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror fulfilling supernatural film. A group of thugs draw a paramilitary-like robbery of the salary at Camp Pendleton, California. The high-jack a cargo plane kidnaps the pilot and his daughter, claiming to be flown to Mexico. Along the way, a greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a corn field watched by strange-looking scarecrows. These are not just some of the most well-known bird criminals ... they can kill. The action is no better than the terrible dialogue. And the attempt at humor is not fun. Very low budget and shot completely in the dark. The game includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
