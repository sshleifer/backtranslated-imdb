The people of Disney have a lot to explain. First of all, why did anyone think this less-sitcom material would ever make a half-decent movie. In Koky 60's telecom game, the unique idea of ​​the martians among us has not yet been given the sophisticated X-Files treatment. Picturesque visions of small green men have long been displaced by people like ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> Any charm the property had was mainly due to the inviting relationship created between late Bill Bixby and Tim and Ray Walston as the unworldly visitor. The notion that the martians have antennae seemed drowsy then. Now it seems positively idiotic. Nevertheless, Christopher Lloyd's uncle Martin practices the metallic pendants. In an early shot, the antenna on a sign for the TV station Tim is working on, should make us think "martian"! When is the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, eh? <br /> <br /> Disney does not rely on picturesque or relationships and crams this flick with teen-wooing special effects that include a talking space tree named Zoot! Yes, you read it correctly - Uncle Martin's silver-space noise speaks. He must be a really fun cut! Figure again. I have stretch socks that are more fun than Zoot. When the action does (and it does constantly), computer graphics are put into play to experience things. Tim is played here by the gracious Jeff Daniels who can't (or doesn't) do anything to save this fiery mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor's lady role. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully drawn into the procedures - all in vain. This foreign visitor is dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> Constant talk of sitcoms turning to the screen only makes me hope that the DREAM OF JEANNIE movie doesn't want a speech harem outfit. I ask that Samantha's cat in the movie BEWITCHED does not have lines. I live in fear that I love LUCY - THE MOVIE will proudly have a CG Conga Drum called Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - Take me to your manager.
