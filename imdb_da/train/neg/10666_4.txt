I am a big 1930s movie fan and want to see most things that I see on Turner Classic Movies that is new to me. So I gave this a shot, despite it being the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent movie comedian. I've seen much less of Lloyd's silent movies than of Chaplins, but I have to say I'm a much larger Chaplin fan. Yet this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his audio career was so limited that he didn't get very good material to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy doing boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in seeing Adolphe Menjou when I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory, but his role here didn't matter to me. Maybe they should have come into the box before, because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed like that) is before he comes in a ring. I can tell that there are many Lloyd fans here, and it won't be a popular review, but I have to judge this from what was out there at that time, 4 out of 10. Don't look at this with anyone You are trying to get old movies because they may not see another with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or looking for lesser known comedies in general, I recommend "Kelly The Second" made a few years earlier, another not becoming a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supportive role of Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
