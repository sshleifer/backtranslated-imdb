It is uneven the mind how this film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's scary, or because the creative held public credentials behind it really should deserve them, but because in each category they were nominated, Prizzi's Honor drawers. Some would argue that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it at this point in his career, but I didn't buy it. Only the previous year he signed the amazing UNDER VOLCANO, a dark character study in Mexico, which is among the finest he has ever done. Prizzi's Honor, on the other hand, shows a film filled with stellar power, good intentions and a proper script, a big downpour. <br /> <br /> The overall tone and plot of a gangster falls in love with a female hit-man who prefers the peculiar warfare that captured Hollywood by storm in the early 90s, but the manuscript is too terrible for its own guilty, the motivations are off, and on the whole the story seems uncertain of what it really is to be: a romantic comedy, a criminal drama, a gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (makes a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro, But sounds convincing comes from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles seems to be in paycheck, just going through the movements almost sleepwalking their way through some parts. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, goes better, but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivation: she starts the victim of her bigot's father's contempt, turns out to be supportive of her former husband, and then becomes a scornful bitch who wants her head a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film have a rinsed quality as it was made in the early 70s, and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as anything else. There is a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director who is hungry to be recognized, it could have been morphed into something better, but what remains is like a movie, nobody was really interested in making.
