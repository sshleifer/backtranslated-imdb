After reading through many of the reviews I do not know what movie some people looked at, but it was clearly not the same thing I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. The action, primarily Moores, is just awful. The woman can't act. Beautiful breasts, but she just can't act. In no time did she come across as the actual character. Instead, the spoiled Hollywood actress went to the beach to play make-believe with the boys. <br /> <br /> And that's what this movie is in the end - Hollywood make-believe. The training sequences are over the top. The policy - over the top. The political correctness - over the top. Battle scenes - you guessed it over the top. Your mission is to come in and get out without being discovered. So what are you doing? Why shoot from so many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can always be my friend. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets it, we end up with Top Gun with breasts. <br /> <br /> What more can you expect from commercial American films? Not much I guess.
