This low-budget B-horror plot comes with all the comforts - mad scientist complete with sidekick, malicious corporate greed in the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology .... can't leave it. <br /> <Start with the odd order of the beautiful, named sailors who stupidly decide to take a dip in the waters near an uncharted island and end up swimming hammerhead sharks ..... Cut to weak back history implies The stockpile of a generic pharma company that motivates its evil Shakespeare cites CEO to entertain an unsolicited offer made by a former employee / scientist who was jilted out of his job as a research director and who also happens to be a nut ... of course ( total Herbert West wannabe). He offers a new stem cell technology that can earn tons o 'cash ... or so it seems ... It is lured in several employees to his Moreau-ish Island (must have been quite an impressive exit from the business when he was deleted to afford an island) to validate its scientific results, including the CEO and, incidentally, the ancestor of the mad scientist's son is now morphing sharkuman (how practical). <br /> <plan is to revive lost love between former wives while demanding revenge on former colleagues for his termination. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter? He has his own freckle island after all ...). <br /> <br /> Soon everyone is on the run (from endless supply of security guards to heavy weapons, from mutant plants? can there be an uncharted island without human plants? from the sharky son's appetite for carnage, from the quartz father's breeding plans and from the lack of cell phone signal) ... and they must all learn to work together to get out of the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will anyone escape? Will a new species be created? See it and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some entertainment value in this movie, but don't expect much ... for the real Combs fan, so don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Don't say I don't warn you.
