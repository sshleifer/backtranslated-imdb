I wondered why John Wood didn't play Dr. Falcon, before I saw the movie. BAD plot, poor science, bad acting and generally a bad movie. Please don't watch this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I didn't like bending the plot to beat the terror threat idea either. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because Russia had thousands of warheads pointed to the United States. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill the terrorist in training before being a threat. Politics aside, one of the good things about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could understand the idea of ​​endless war in the end. No such insight is offered in this movie.
