I'm grown up with Scooby Doo all my life, my dad grew up with Scooby Doo. We just saw the first episode of the travesty that calls itself Shaggy and Scooby gets a little. Which planet is Warner Bros letting these shambles fly. The characters could have been better drawn by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins ​​(there are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are just not !!!!! if anyone than Casey Kasem makes the voice of Shaggy it just won't work people !! trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was shameful. What's New Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format. Pack this piece of waste and go back to the true Scooby
