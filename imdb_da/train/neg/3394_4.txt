This movie features Ben Chaplin as a boring bank worker in England who orders a mail order brand from Russia, receives Nicole Kidman in the post and gets more than he negotiated when she surprises, she's not what she seems to be. The story is pretty predictable, and Chaplin supports too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoyant. Kidman is actually pretty good at this role, making her character the only thing in this movie that is interesting. GRADE: C
