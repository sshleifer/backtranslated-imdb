I recently purchased the DVD and forgot how much I hated the movie version of "A Chorus Line." Every change made by the director Attenborough to the story failed. <br/> <br /> By making the Director-Cassie relationship so prominent, the entire ensemble premise of the musical sails out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical tracks have sped up and rushed. The song's hit song gets the whole meaning broken when given to Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The overall scene is very self-conscious. The only reason I give it a 2 is because a few of the big numbers can still be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every joy and spontaneity out of it.
