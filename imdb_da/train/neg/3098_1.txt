How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion. This movie is absolutely criminal. Before I watched this movie, I thought Manos: Hands of Fate was the worse piece of shit I have ever seen, but at least the manosas go so slowly that you can fall asleep and thereby save your eyes from the pain it will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this movie is that the old man holding the Hobgoblins "locked up" makes it the last scene. The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
