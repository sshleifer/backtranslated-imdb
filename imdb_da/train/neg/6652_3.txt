This was a strange kind of movie about Lively Life in New York City and centered on a protagonist (the title name, played by Brad Pitt), who believes he is a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent. <br /> <br /> It is fun to see until a profane, hard-wearing New York City-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over. It ruined the movie for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays hard and rubbish bins. <br /> <br /> The haircut of Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to watch. I can see that Johnny Depp plays this role better. One final note: It's strange to hear a movie made in 1992 (except Woody Allens) with just mono sound.
