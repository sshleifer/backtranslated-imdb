Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shining Oscars from Avatar just because the politicians wanted another war movie to increase acceptance (support?) For wars the US is still fighting today. I don't really want to go into politics here, but come on, it's more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker doesn't really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel in the 50s in Hungary when the party told the people what they liked and what they didn't like. The same propaganda films were produced at that time, only with the exception that they were black and white. Although we consider this title a fair piece of the "American War is cool" genre, you probably have much better movies to choose from.
