Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) has Hough-directed bust a little to go by. <br /> <br /> Although not lacking in gruesome violence, it lacks narrative sensibility and "signs". <br /> <br /> The title "Incubus" is a demon equipped with a mammoth penis that shoots red semen into vagins during intercourse - or to be more precise, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, moon shadows from his successful instructor career, is convincing as a physician questioning the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> Terrible opportunities for victims who favor demonic offspring are not considered - and neither is the public's tolerance for slow-moving waste. <br /> <br /> The scripture's reluctance to explore the dramatic consequences of a fruitful performance exemplifies the major problems with this weak Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
