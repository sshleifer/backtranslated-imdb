Soon after watching this movie you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead, this is a common theme in Hollywood, ripping off previous great movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie's plot jumped everywhere as a ping pong ball, and character development was non-existent. I felt seriously as if I was watching a comedy on some points in the movie, because the play was so bad. P Diddy has to stop emptying movies with his horrible acting, he has actually made me laugh every time. The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie and actually enjoyed watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a great Carlito's Way fan, I recommend you not to see this. If you decide to watch it anyway, treat this movie as if it ripped out of the original, because that's exactly what it did.
