I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this movie was spied on), but this one failed me miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow, and I quickly lost interest. I'm so sorry John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff to get involved in this movie. I will remain a fan of them all, but only time can heal my feelings about it. The only thing I can say positive about the movie is that Hillary played Yonica's character so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary; It took me a couple of scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through the Red Box; had i paid to see it on the big screen, i would really fuming !!
