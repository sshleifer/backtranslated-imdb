When I found out, there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof! But I had a hard fall after seeing this lame movie and I still have a blue mark. First of all, the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment) was just awful. He treated his family as a crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I couldn't get close to or sympathize with any of the characters, and I'm not prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary, or they might have been toned down. Wynona and Antonio's characters could have been developed much more, and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what about Meryl's character and her "mysterious powers"? Why didn't they go into this more? This movie had many dead ends and the bottom is that this is a really miserable movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.
