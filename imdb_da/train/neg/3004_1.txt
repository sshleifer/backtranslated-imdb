What a horrible movie. The action was poor, the pacing was poor, the cinematography was poor, the control was poor, the "special" effects were poor. You expect some degree of badness in a slasher, but even the killings were bad. First of all, the last event that put the motif into slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of it and explained what happened well enough. <br /> <br /> Then, the victims were invited to "reunification" in an abandoned school that still had all utilities lit. One of the victims thought it was a little strange, but they dismissed it and decided to break in anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the killings were so fake that they could hardly be packed. <br /> <br /> There is no need to watch this movie unless you want to see some breasts and not very good breasts there. This movie makes Showgirls almost inseparable from Citizen Kane.
