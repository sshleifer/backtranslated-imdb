Loved the original story, had very high expectations for the movie (especially since Barker rages it in interviews), finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The management is everywhere, the actor was horrible, the flashy images and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what about the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward moonsons? It was stylishly yes but not necessary in this movie and cheaper vibe in some silly MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video). While some of the killings are pretty tough and brutal, some are just ridiculously ridiculous (the first killing of the Japanese girl was fun and Ted Raimi's death was just stupid fun). It just rushes all over the place with zero voltage and excitement, completely away from the original story and then goes back to the one in the final, which at that time just feels dressed to destroy it even more. No explanations were given at all, I think I knew what happened only when I wanted to read the story, but for people who didn't, it was even more confusing than at times, even though I didn't know where it went And what it was trying to do - it went on a crazy key all the time. God, I really wanted to like this movie as I am a big fan of Barker's work and loved the story as it has huge potential hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's movies as a fun drum, but this movie just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish - I didn't care for anyone or anything, the whole was rushed and severely cut from the actual source, making it something completely different. Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a great badass, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. purified
