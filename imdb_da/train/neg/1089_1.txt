What about Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Does he save on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a law office where everyone is working on candles? <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. In fact, don't waste your time with anything Altman does: It's all a pretentious waste of movies.
