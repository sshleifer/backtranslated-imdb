Having seen "Bodyguard" last night, I felt I had to write a review of it. <br /> <br /> This could have been a pretty decent movie if it hadn't been for the horrible camera work. It was beyond annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the battle sequences. The close-ups were even horrible. The story has Sonny Chiba hiring as a bodyguard for anyone who is willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite equal to Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug shelter is deeper than Chiba believed, as Mob and another gang of bullies are after her. The story was decent, and despite horrible duplication, this could have been a good movie. Considering better direction and editing, I'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. Like it is more like another cheesy 70s action movie. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a quote known for "Pulp Fiction" fans, and then proceeds to a karate school in Times Square that is by no means related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
