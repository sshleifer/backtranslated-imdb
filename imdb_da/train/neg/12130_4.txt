Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Cemetery) and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talent, you would believe that this movie would have been a real gore party. This couldn't be further away from it. Massacre falls straight on the face as one of the most boring slasher movies I've seen coming out of Italian cinema. I actually struggled to stay awake during the movie, and I never had that problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre starts with a hook being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in Fulci's Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene, and it raises your expectations of the movie as a winning slaughter. Unfortuanitly, the next hour in the movie is so boring. The movie goes on to a set of horror movies being filmed, and there is a lot of character development in all these scenes, but the characters in the movie are so boring and poorly behaved, your interest begins to leak away. The last 30 minutes of the movie is not that bad, but it could still have been much better. Gore in the movie was pathetic, and when Fulci used most of the performing scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here. The end of the film left a good twist, but it was still very unanswered and continuity fell right through the floor. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but for a real Italian horror freak like myself) this movie is a must, as it is very rare. 4/10 stars
