Well done Al Gore! You've become the first person to make $ 1 billion of global warming bulbs! Like every other man made fable in the world, this is up there with the best lies to have sucked in so many people. Safe polution is not a good thing and I will love that all the tree continues to grow, but global warming is a business! It employs thousands of people who are all very misleading. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are just many things that just do not fill up, but well, Al, you failed as a politician, but continued to earn a lot of money in the world. <br /> <br /> What's next? Santa Claus is genuine?
