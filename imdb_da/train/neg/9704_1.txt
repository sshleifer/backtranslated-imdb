Okay, if you have a few hours to waste, or if you just hate your life, I'd say watch this movie. If that's something, it's good for a couple of laughs. Not only do you have overweight, topless natives, but also special effects so bad that they are probably banned in most states. Seriously, the assessment of 'PG' is also quite humorous when one sees the native porn requirement. I wouldn't give this movie to my late nephew. You couldn't even show it to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The foundation is sketchy, and clich√©, and stupid and stupid. The play is terrible and the end is so painful to see that I actually started pouring salt into my eye just to think about the idiocy that fills my TV screen.
