This is yet another depressing and boring movie about AIDS and tragedy. It begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the film. I was waiting to pick up, but unfortunately it never did. The action is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you're looking for nudity, don't waste your time with these not so hot actors. Because of the poor sound quality and missing captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five gay movies or recently been gay, you might find this movie interesting, or it's your low budget low budget movie. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
