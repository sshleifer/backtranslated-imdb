I watched this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience of being ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was great, but I found out later that it had every explosion or "special effect" throughout the movie (about 4) and even some that were not in the movie. There was some kind of plot related to foreigners, but foreigners were never shown in the movie as far as I remember. It was obviously a case that someone made a buck of a cheap movie designed to scam people. I think my world of innocence ended the day when I found out there were bad people out there making bad bad movies.
