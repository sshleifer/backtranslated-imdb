Positively horrible George Sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to a policeman. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was an outstanding character actor, he was definitely no leading man and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It's totally beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart gave some comic relief until a moment of anger gave him the shot of his gun with tragedies. <br /> <br /> Sadly, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis have committed suicide in real life. After making a movie as regrettable as this, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here.
