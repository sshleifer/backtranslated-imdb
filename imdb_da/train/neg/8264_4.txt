This is a movie where the actors are all fine, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie where each of the three couples encounters a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story going. In other words, it feels like they are favorite movie scenes, not like real life. Although women working on peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers, it doesn't seem to be realistic in the same way as it is written in this movie. When one of the characters meets the obese woman in the movie, it also feels artificial how they look at each other seconds after argument. Again, the actors are all good, and moments in this movie are good, but generally another indie that could have used some rewrites before production rolled.
