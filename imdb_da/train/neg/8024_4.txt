Sitting down to see the 14th season of Bachelor ("On the Wings of Love") I knew I would be in for an "interesting" time. I had seen some of the previous seasons of Bachelor in passing; see an episode or two and missing the next three or so. I find that the bachelor is often appealing and exciting, even though quality and morality are lacking. <br /> <br /> "On the Wings of Love" describes the journey taken by Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, which truly is a love that can be found in a season long reality drama dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He starts to know them a little, but it's mostly superficial; how well can you get to know someone in a couple of 5 minutes conversation? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the beginning, at least to the audience. He noted that he not only wants love or good time, but he wants a fianc√© or wife. We can only assume that he has made it clear to the women in the competition too. If that is the case, it may in part explain some of the actions of women. The women are super competitive. Although they do not know Jake at all, they are still able to win it no matter what the cost. Not only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty. Threats, backstabbing and "Watch out!" everyone shows that these women were not good either. Jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal, but looking for "a connection." However, the girls drew all the stops to try to impress Jake with the aforementioned sex appeal. They arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses ?? either low or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to keep their sense of decorum, others missed the memo altogether. A girl, Channy, noted that Jake was a "good guy" to whom she could be a "naughty girl." She continued to say that Jake could land on his "runway at any time." She got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement that showed their take on these situations. <br /> <br /> So a reality dating show couldn't be that bad, could it? In addition to the obvious question of sex-driven attraction, there are other problems that are marring this seemingly harmless show. Is it the right way to find a future mate? vow for a person's attention by flaunting themselves to extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, what America has reduced to these days: joy and sex without commitment and some happiness on the side. Another problem is the premature emotional attachment, where many of the girls are bound to Jake. A few girls seemed particularly attached. A girl said "If I don't get the first impression the rose it'll kill me!" As mentioned earlier, they don't even know him, and she talked about a particular rose, not just one of the 15 roses that had to be eliminated. <br /> <br /> In particular, it seemed that Michelle had some issues related to Jake. The other girls also noticed it. After a certain Michelle outbreak, Vienna claimed that Michelle had a "mental breakdown and we have only been here for an hour." Michelle got the last praise of the evening on the first show ?? narrowly missing elimination ?? and was extremely emotional about it. The other girls thought it was simply ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It began with Survivor, and from there it just took off? reality TV. It shows our entertainment interests as a country; If we didn't watch the shows and rated them well, the network wouldn't continue to run them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is affiliated. One thing is clear: America (generally) loves real-life television and its subsequent stairs. <br /> <br /> This asks me to ask: Why is it that we like reality TV ourselves? What is it about what draws us to it? Is it because we see the similarities to our own life, or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever it is that draws us to it, we should be careful about the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad; However, I say that we should evaluate each one. <br /> <br /> Episodes of Criticism: Season Premier and Episode 2.
