WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed like Black Chicks, oh yes, they would not look any different. Can anyone give me a Wayan movie where they haven't dressed like ladies? Don't be a match doesn't count, Jack White and Michael Costanza ghost wrote it (the other Norton Trio members served as directors). In White Chicks there are never really any jokes. It's just Wayans, who acts as girls for 2 hours. There are no setups, no punchlines and no laughs. There are a lot of "I think I should play a little time crisis 3." At least for me there were 5 times to be precise. <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. The only thing that hurts the O-Zone team. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * out of ****
