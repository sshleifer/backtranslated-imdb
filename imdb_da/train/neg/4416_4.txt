A less than subtle poke on the faith and doctrine of the Catholic Church is given a darker death screen near the end of the show. Through the show, dark humor plays a medium through which several often heard rhetorical questions are posed, especially "If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is Excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (although some may disagree) by the stereotypical religious teachers spitting the "brand name" and condemning half the world to burning in hell . To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas day. <br /> <br /> But when the Quartet "updates" their game to parody Sister Maria's "false" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge and sends the story spirally into a chain of unhappy events. The end finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go see the game instead.
