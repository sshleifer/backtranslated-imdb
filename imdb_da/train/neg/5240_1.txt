As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of its producers, I have to say that it does not fall into any known movie category, it deserves a whole new name for itself! It's a "neurological drama"! It mourns and depresses each neuron inside a person's brain. <br /> <br /> It's the closest one ever gets to a stroke without suffering one. It drove you speechless, all your members become stupid, your mouth falls open and stays so, and the most weird symptom of everything is that you make yourself blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> No small experience for such a kind of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind is just to end my trial is EXIT !!!!!!
