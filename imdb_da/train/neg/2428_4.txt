The thing the viewers will remember most is the bad headache film has given them because of the overly flashy camera work and the fast, confusing cut. I'm not against the kind of stylistic units if they're done just like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh evidence with most of their movies, but in this case there was too much. It seems like the cuts and light bottles that accompanied each flight over Mexico City, and all the important scenes were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin, and everything was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily find out how the whole thing will end. For a film pretending to be violent, ruthless, and morally corrupt, it is unthinkable that its history has been told so many times and with much more depth and character development. It's another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to see one over the top action, I do not need any justification, but this film attempted to justify the killed spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed to deliver any credible beliefs. The first half hour or nothing happens, except that stupid archetypes and clich√©s are portrayed, and when the action machine begins to roll, it is cut so fast that you don't know what's really going on. So the movie doesn't work at the level of a credible drama / thriller, nor as a pure action movie. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the most puzzled blockbusters in recent years, but I absolutely can't understand why so many people claim that this movie is something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is far too long, and for a movie it has too little substance.
