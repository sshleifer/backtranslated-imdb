I couldn't believe how horrible this movie was; I rarely see commercial television, but thought "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth seeing". I am corrected. Everyone involved should hang their heads in shame. I realize that there are not many good roles for women of a certain age, but the manuscript for this was so unfortunate, clich√© and amazing that I am surprised that it ever came into development or that Mrs Keaton believed that she could make a silk bag out of this sauce ear. None of the characters had a bunch of credibility and were so incredibly unlikeable. The play looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open mouth prison through most of this wondering "What did they think?" Very, very sorry that this has come to this. Do not waste your time.
