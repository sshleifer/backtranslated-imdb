.. IT IS THIS! Very nice premise, just outside the bats. <br /> <br /> Having an excellent first scene should give credit where credit is due. <br /> <br /> Have solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: When the ghosts appeared that I really liked the way; how it was done, how it looked ... the only thing was the ghost's relationship. Because of the way things went down in the first scene, you would think their dynamics would be different. Things dropped a little too much in the middle I felt, and the crab / spider scene was just not good. BUT then the end is actually very good! Sure, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens, but no samurai's, and that was what I liked about this movie relatively. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a temperate style re-records this movie. <Br /> <br /> Fans of 'Silent Rage' would absolutely love this movie.
