There are not enough gay movies and there is not enough "coming out" movies. Each one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the movie `looks' good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks really good in a pair of jeans), that is bad. It is a period: homosexual life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) a life that works 40 years behind the west. In a way, we see our own story; what it could have been for gays in the 40s and 50s here (it often reminded me of the last exit to the Brooklyn: book not the movie). But it is tirelessly depressing and slow in a constructed way that evoked an old SCTV broadcast by Ingmar Bergman. It's so bluntly edited I wonder if the director just didn't hack randomly. Yes, it's a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, the life behind the 'curtain' was difficult for homosexuals. A good instructor could have shown everything without confusing the audience. A good director would have made me mark this as one of the great upcoming movies and not one of the misses.
