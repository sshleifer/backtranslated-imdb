If this is a person's favorite movie, they need a serious help. There is nothing funny or wise in this crapfest. I have not seen the original movie, this is the remake of (some 1950s movies), but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization. A great one gets kicked out of the military to be a fringe element and winds up teaching kids at a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the protagonist Daman Wayans is ... so the kids are in for a world of annoying, humorous asylum. Can Wayan whip these losers in shape? Can they make him a little more human? The movie bombs like most Wayans movies, with only a few shining moments. William Hickey gets approx. one minute of screen time, just too little. This charming old man, known to me as a "Tales from the Crypt" actor, known as you as Uncle Louis from "Christmas Vacation", shines every moment he is on the screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also looks like a biker that fits him perfectly. I didn't mind a little more Bam Bam, but I think he wore the role of "biker" as far as it could be worn for a military movie. <br /> <br /> And then there is the attractive teacher who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert to someone you want to spend time with. She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which (although it seems "stupid" since the movie makes it clear she's coming out of the house often enough). <br /> <br /> Wayans had a shining moment: a dance sequence in which he performs a series of movements (including a very nice "robot") and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. This scene was entertaining but hardly created for anything else that made this movie dog crisp. <br /> <br /> Seriously avoid this movie. If you want to watch a movie about a loser who helps lose, children become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he is a lovable loser, and actually fun. Perhaps if Major Payne had fought a badger, I would feel better, but he didn't. Forget Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do so much better.
