Flat, ordinary thriller about a connected woman who deceives all those she probably loves to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the fraudulent Tracey, married to Doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old schoolgirl of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) emerges as a resident surgeon, problems are not far behind him. <br /> <br /> Script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise for an effective, exciting thriller, and the serious lack of character motivation, background and development leaves the whole show to reach. None of the casts are able to interest their low-key, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicable inquisitive Andy is impossible to believe. Poor leader, Harold Becker, tries to revive an impossible dead project and cannot make entertainment from any of them. At that time, the plot's "secret" is revealed, you just don't care. <br /> <br /> At least Massachusetts's cinematography has good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
