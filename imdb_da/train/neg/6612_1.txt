I downloaded this movie yesterday through a site, the quality was pretty good! I watched the movie with high expectations (though I knew it was a flop), especially when the movie has superstar Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a villain. I though at least actors like him would have done something for their roles. Unfortunately, Mr Bachchan failed to impress as a crook, it turned out that no one can compete with AMJAD KHAN's magical Rgv's attempt to resume the royal past! Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian film with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that is still a hit with contemporary generations. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's talents is wasted and his performance was average. Prashant Raj, a newcomer does not know what is acting. Nisha Kothari turned out to be one of the worst actresses we have, I don't know how she is still in the RGV crew Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song without excitement and passion. Mohanlal tried her best and Susmitha Sens's work was good, I liked her work in this movie It was a total carnage of the original Sholay
