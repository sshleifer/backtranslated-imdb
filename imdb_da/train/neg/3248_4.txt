Why did I go to watch this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it, and in the past he made funny movies that made me cry with laughter, so do you really owe me to expect it again? The prerequisite, the fun trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston's involvement and the fact that it was a massive hit stateside, encouraged me. <br /> <br /> But as my "One Line Summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It wasn't fun. In a 2-hour movie I laughed for approx. 5-10 minutes. All of the time I sat and thought, "I really should have been ice cream." I admit it might be wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes pearls like 'The Truman Show', 'Liar Liar', 'Me, Myself and Irene', 'Dumb and Dumber, 'The Mask' and 'Ace Ventura' movies produce such a mediocre movie in Bruce Nolan's own words? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally granted. I mean hi! She has been in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this movie she gets about four lines to say. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: One word - Clich√© Reason 4: A leisurely spread of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps the week' - is a clue that the film is especially homemade appeal. "A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education - it's a miracle! Will you soon see a miracle? Be that miracle!" God tells Bruce, a heavily survived sentiment that seems to have fallen into a treat in the United States, but may face harder resistance in markets that maintain a flair for subtlety. In addition, I still go to school, and this statement suggests me and my friend are miracles ... or maybe it just means we have brains? <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are enough fun Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total accident, but you are advised to start revising your expectations down.
