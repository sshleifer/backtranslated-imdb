Usually I am a bit of a fan of the bad eighties and the early 1990s now have prayers ... but this movie is so incredibly awful that it was a real endurance test to sit through. Boys who clap like girls have been killed - but never so pathetic. Corey Haim's performance was immense as usual, Nicole Eggert wasn't much better. This has no redeeming qualities, even if you are the number 1 fan of an actor / actress in this piece of waste - stay away!
