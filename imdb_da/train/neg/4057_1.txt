This is a very boring movie. If you grew up in Vietnam Was, as I did, you have seen and heard all the film recordings and arguments here a hundred times now. But what really makes this movie boring is the story of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film is shot with Sherwood, speaking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, you won 'I find something new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent movie Going Upriver! Proud honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job at John Kerry, but it failed mistakenly in achieving that goal.
