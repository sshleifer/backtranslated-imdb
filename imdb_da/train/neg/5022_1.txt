Oh dear, this movie was bad for various reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this movie and was a little surprised at the over-all score. Grief, but to judge this much as many have, is a joke! When you pass one shot / black and white movie gimmick, which was a good idea, the movie pulls on even at a maturity of only 66 minutes. The credit sequence in the beginning was also so annoying! In the habit of the guys, a flat tire suffers and changes the wheel, wow, it was necessary in history! How slow were guys chasing and actually coping with Campbell ?? They didn't seem to bother chasing him ... sigh .. I'm just too glad I got this free with a special edition of evil dead !!
