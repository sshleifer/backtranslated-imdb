Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. When she survives a relentless series of disappointments and trauma, she takes out her anger at the closest targets. <br /> <br /> When she sees violence transformed and focused on discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /> <br /> The movie progresses from there, as Diana teaches the usual commercial lessons along with the necessary skills for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the role, especially when communicating a young women's focused anger on all sides and fighting not only personal circumstances but rooted sexism. <br /> <br /> The image could use some subtlety in its direction of all the young actors who are pale to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many breaks in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall silence of the film diverts it by intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture to see once if you can only see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to encompass her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in "see it again and again" category.
