Not the best of the actors' films. The director has concentrated on the projected actor's star rather than giving a good entertainer. Can be quite self, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But it is definitely not worth the neutral audience. The fighting sequences are a total comedy. The movements of the dance in the song sequences are pathetic. The music is average. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the hype that was created over the movie, the movie was unsuccessful. Don't even think about seeing this feature even if you want to kill time. You can see some comics instead. A good film buffer cannot digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.
