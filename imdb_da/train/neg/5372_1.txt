One wonders why this image was made: the plot as such is incredible, if it is not ridiculous, the characters (experienced loner cop versus younger, totally fascinated) quite predictable, the end completely unclear and impossible to understand (perhaps after several impressions But you have to have a masochistic tendency for it, the idea is to read the book to understand fully what it is about) and the play is bad. Was the basic idea to show that French filmmakers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include "seven" and "silence of the lamb"? If so, it's a total failure. However, it was quite successful (and has some kind of cult status as the first French serial killer movie) and it seems to be a good product to export. Strange.
