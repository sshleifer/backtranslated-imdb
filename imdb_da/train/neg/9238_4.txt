One-note comedy that probably puts modern feminist teeth on the edge. The Betsy Drake department store is in love with the idea of ​​babies and marriage, hoping for women's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of elegant bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the movie stretches from one move to the next as the relentless Drake pursues his quarry. I guess the word "perky" just about the sum of Drake's approach to the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of remembering her dentures, I started to overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. However, there is a scene that almost prepares this slim exercise. Drake asks the unfortunate Grant after his lecture to a roomy respectful lady. Here, her naughty way has an undisturbed freshness that is truly remarkable, and if the production had not rubbed our noses in the optimistic laugh for 90 minutes, the film could have been more than a girls' daytime dream around 1948.
