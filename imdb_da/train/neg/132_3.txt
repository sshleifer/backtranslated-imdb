"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared into the Peruvian Amazon. A year later he left the jungle ... naked. It took him 45 years to go back." Presumably, "Keeping the river to your right" is "a modern cannibal tale". In reality, anyone seeking some insight into cannibalism will, unfortunately, be disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of New Ginuea, mainly touting the native art. The second half relies on still images of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but it's really about it. Unless of course you are interested in home videos of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum introduces its former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal story." - NOTE
