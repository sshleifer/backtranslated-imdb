Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was "42nd Street". So I expected all his stuff to be so good. I found out that it wasn't necessarily the case, even here, with my all-time favorite classic-era actor James Cagney. Oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like many of the others and quite tiring. They always seem to involve screaming, unhappy exhibitors. In this movie it is Cagney who wins up shouting out so often that he gives me headaches after a while and his character carries thin .... fast! Even the songs here are everywhere near "42nd Street" class, songs you could hum for years and years - decades I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early Cagney movies - and Berkeley movies - I don't like and was very disappointed while I was watching.
