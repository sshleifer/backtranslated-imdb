Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation? <br /> <br /> There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they clearly complain about the money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks appropriately embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a "watchable" fit of Cartland, Bonham Carter is the one to go after ("A Heart Disease" - what a title !!). Gilbert is the weak link in it, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course it can work, and the rest of the cast plays it to the heel with his tongues stuck in his cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
