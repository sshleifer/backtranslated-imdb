Normally, I would not feel qualified to undergo anything I saw for only half an hour, but I will make an exception for this. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the evil guys' lines: "I smell ... teacher!" "Sorry, teacher! You get a 'F!'" Bad guy and poor girl (just after killing 2 police and stealing a van full of drugs, they get hot and heavy): <br /> He / - "So how are you shooting some innocent spectators?" <br /> <br /> Her- (purrs) "You know how to show a girl a good time ..." A generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone gets to sum up his life and personality in this line - "I'm a CHICKEN-TWIT! (It was the US network version) My old man was right! He left us ..." Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Not really a spoiler) Bad guy (four) screams "Aargh! Fire!"
