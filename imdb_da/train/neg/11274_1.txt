Just because with other movie fans you get the point about this movie, I decided to write a new review. I missed a few things last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, it is. Third, Jesus Christ, what did they think about making a waste like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming properties at all from the beginning to the end, except when Joseph Fiennes finally blows away in a lot unexciting climax !!! <br /> <br /> I can't believe I wasted my money on this as I could have given it to a homeless person or a bush or something! <br /> <br /> Are you getting the picture?
