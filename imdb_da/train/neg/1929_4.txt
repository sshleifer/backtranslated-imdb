Some have praised -Atlantis: -The Lost Empire- as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so - at least not to think adults. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that hit a person like the kind of crap you can't sell to adults anymore. The "explosive staff" of many older fairy-tale movies have been done well before, (think The Dirty Dozen), but -Atlantis - represents one of the worst movies in that motif. The signs are weak. Even the background that each member trusts seems to be stocked and awkward at best. An MD / Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic, whose father always wanted sons, if we haven't seen these before, we have seen mix-and-match quirks before. The story of how an ensign, Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went from flower shops to demolition completely convincing. <br /> <br /> Only the protagonist Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-possessed scholar spoken by Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. Milos search for Atlantis continues with his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee as his grandfather places his pith helmet upside down. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were thin at best, the best part about the country was voice talent. Commander Rourke loses nothing that is expressed by James Garner. Although Rourke is a fairly military type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into signs just at his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highlight. I'm sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy's Dying King is nothing but mandatory. In addition, Don Novello was a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, also known for one or two successful fun lines - but I've always listened to Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. <br /> <br /> Also well done was computer animation. BACKGROUND the animation, ie. Draw the animation does nothing, if not do, already flat characters appear even flatter. Except for landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is little to impress. <br /> <br /> The reason was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any useful reason can be made something new with the right treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the case. And Atlantis clearly lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can't start going into all the logical holes without a spoiler section. The reason was poor. Plot's bridges snap like yarn and the end doesn't make sense. To add to this, the script and animation are whipped by annoying blur. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> In the beginning, when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been mistakenly translated, and "Ireland's coast" should read "Iceland's coast" , we begin to have problems. The writer's writers should know that the British takes for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignores the older, Latin term Hibernia. But more than this, they need to know about the vicar's conspiracy to call the greener island of Iceland and the ecological island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> Making it a misplaced "letter", the authors have condemned a run version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis should have sunk into its underwater hole. And without visible traces and less technology than Milo had made the inscription far less credible. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd's Journal could not be written before Atlantis descending, or it would not know anything about the cave or the crystal lying "in the eye of the king". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology of Milo's expedition, how did he get any of the Leviathan. So how could it know more about something after that? And why would it be written in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. But clairvoyance and astral travel do not require writing in the Atlantic. So it should be a kind of automatic writing. Since no one can read in Atlantis, it must be the spirit of the crystal radiant messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. But could also have been explained in the film: Milo could have herded having discovered that this power had called him his entire life - appeared in dreams, etc. This was to be explored in the film. <br /> <br /> The Atlantic should simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to speak in Europe more than the Romans would understand that hard "c" s or their day became French "ch" s (pronounced "sh" s, no less!) <Br /> <br /> Current Atlantians lived before the disaster - when they * could * read, but now are unable to read what they used to use or operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> Mass Artery points to a critical flaw in the movie. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in the air until Milo can save it. Although life does not seem to be a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to make poetry or write novels, and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantic school systems that go downhill and lack of good fiction that got Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the disaster was stupid - but some of the ** hard ** qualifies her father deification !! Kashakim's folly almost wiped his own hand out of his life. Killed a bunch in the disaster, stopped progress (not much killed here, but he watched a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if they were not cooked in the lava first because the big robots were not there to protect them. A bolt of blue electricity would have crushed Kashakim's resemblance when Kida tried to join her father's image to the circle of great kings in Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read the Atlantic, Rourke and others knew enough to browse a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal - which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or phases of the Sun's chart. <br /> <br /> If Milos grandfather had told Rourke about it, it still doesn't explain how Rourke would have a bit of Milos reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page - which was dog-hair in Rourke's hand, although Milo did not find signs on a torn page in the book apparently - there was only to tip the viewer that "something was not quite right". Unless the word "crystal" would have turned off alarms in Milo's head that someone would try to steal it, Milo would have lost something. It is just thick-headed foreclosure. <br /> <br /> The crew is "double cross" not a sign change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had joined forces with Rourke from the start. But the "heart change" falls flat. It was a change and should be better motivated. Hard to do with signs that were not given anything at first. <br /> <br /> Niggling little that lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area from which we see the sequence. It is fluid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills all lower areas. The final STINKS! - and makes no sense other than appease political correctness. With its restored power source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power that needs coddling. The gigantic robotic guards and the skyscrapers that shoot blue light indicate that they have less to fear for us than they might have. The technology is better than ours, and certainly until the early 20th century. In the end, Milo must teach the Atlantic to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, throwing culture alone, not to send it to hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Lost World plot and the setting of the turn of the century should give me a hint that this is more a tribute to masses. The errors I find with the movie are in line with this idea. But I'm at a loss why I have to pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels also had them. And mass stories are part of "crap they can't sell adults anymore" anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated, and our pulp must also grow up. The Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its density and avoided so much evil. 4 out of 10 - the movie is entertaining, but as I think of the plot, it still looks lower.
