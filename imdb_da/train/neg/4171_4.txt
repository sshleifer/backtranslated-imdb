I had passed this title 15 or 20 times in Blockbuster, looking for something half decent to see. All I can say is that they were all out half way decent movies the night I chose to rent this. <br /> <br /> I want to give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than "Dracula 3000" but in reality it's pretty easy to say, as it didn't have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things that were lacking in spades were: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can't have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... go figure) flew from the mine colony to the mine colony to eradicate all the vampires it could find . The crew consists of: the chin, ne'er-well-well-captain (who dies early), his book, yet inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a style), a wannabe cowboy and a real, real butch Asian command, "hard guy" female ... it almost sounds like cast for MTV's 'The Real World'. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of blood sugar (and, as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy), his first mate takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him .. blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said, the same story was used in about a hundred other "movies" of the genre. The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The Vampire Vampire Hunter (still not a style) was quite warm, but of course, if you wait for her to postpone more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can't say it was the worst movie I've seen when I actually rented 'Starship Troopers 2' but wait for this to come on the Sci-Fi Channel.
