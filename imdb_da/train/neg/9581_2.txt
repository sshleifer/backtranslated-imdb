That's the only thing I can say positively about this movie. Cleveland is the star I have been there and never experienced the city looking good. Beautiful river and cityscape. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving forward at such a pace that they hope you will not notice the lack of real world relevance. People run around and shoot weapons without any consequence. For example, there is a shooting at Rob Lowe's character house - two cars are stolen, and yet the police do not experience much later in the film. Murder for rent never looked so incredible. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of a movie that is countless stray balls. Many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this. I check the date of the movie to make sure it was not written under the author's strike, but unfortunately it was not. This movie is currently in rotation on Universal's HD channel - unless you want to waste over Lowe, there's no need to watch it.
