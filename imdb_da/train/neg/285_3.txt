It's not just about gymnastics; Replace occasional training assembly, and it can just as easily be about archery, microbiology or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead of all the other Rocky / Flashdance derivatives that flooded the 80s market, it's about overcoming adversity with stick-to-it iveness, making all social / personal realities irrelevant to your lonely - with love interest standing of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; So as a piece of cinema it is down to the details. Some of the actors are nice enough to experience things - especially the love interest that is brought to you by no one other than Mr. Keanu Reeves who heats Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abos hateful alie girl and big hair fighters are more interesting than the sick mother or her completely inert bitch nemeses / teammates, one of whom seems to be made of porcelain. It is my instinct to be horrified by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand they are at least in the movie. But D'Abo does not fully convince with his sinister girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus, the lack of interest in gymnastics really means herself; It's just organs that slip around, and not only is the result of the big tournament a previous conclusion, it's all done by a blatant double.
