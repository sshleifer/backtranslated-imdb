I do not like this movie, but then I did not think much about the book, which, although praised by many as a "masterpiece", I found lack of character development and uninhibited and illogical in plot, although it was far more readable than Fante's terrible first action "Road to Los Angeles" was not announced until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated to see what kind of soup Towne would make with such bad ingredients. He has worked hard script-wise to repair the many flaws in the book, but for my money it did not save. There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while ever trying to stay true to the book. I consider this movie Townes folly. <br /> <br /> In a word: Forgettable.
