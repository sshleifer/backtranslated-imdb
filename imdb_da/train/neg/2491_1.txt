The Maiden Voyage is just that. I would like to say straight away that I saw 5 minutes of this before I just couldn't stop it anymore. As already mentioned in another comment, this movie does not fall throughout "so bad, it's good" things, it's just bad. The action is horrible, sfx is poor, and the story is bland and stupid. Even extras suck, "bag guards" and such seems to hold their weapons as pistols. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother to watch this movie, all that's special about it is no matter how low your expectations are, you'll still be disappointed.
