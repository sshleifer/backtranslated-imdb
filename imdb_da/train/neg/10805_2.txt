The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq playing basketball for us now and 2. I've always heard how terrible it was. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were good, just about everything else. My 12-year-old son and I just squirmed and couldn't see the screen when Shaq started rapping and we wondered why Max didn't want Kazzam to fix the front tooth on his! But for all that is terrible, we just couldn't stop seeing it, the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar grave, it was hypnotic. But it was worth the laughs and just to say that we actually saw "Kazzam".
