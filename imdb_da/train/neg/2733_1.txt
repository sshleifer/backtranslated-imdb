I debated whether to cross the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show is probably already seen by a Scrubs supporter, it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Clip shows. Grrr. We all knew that Friends went down the pipe when they started with rock shows ... and five and a half years in Scrubs, they've gone and fallen into that hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if writers just couldn't disturb write that week and said to themselves "let's show the other fun things." It did not work. <br /> <br /> For starters, all the times people have fallen down do not show fun when taken out of context. It is not fun to see Todd dangling at his banana hammock unless we know why he dangled at his banana hammock. Secondly, because what was to be a collection of JD's fantasies was a Turkish dream, another was not his imagination even though I forgot which. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgettable. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? It is not fun. Finally, I must admit two of my favorite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation ... Dr. Cox realized that Ben died ... and JD tells him how proud he is. <br /> <br /> However, even seeing these moments did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> Worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, Don't let your show go like friends, keep it fresh, keep it fun ... or unpack it.
