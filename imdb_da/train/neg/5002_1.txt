How did such a horrible script succeed in attracting this cast? Ridiculous, predictable and incredibly incredible, this is well-behaved and smoothly directed, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the all-time worst thrillers I've seen this year. Incredibly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs even if you are a fan of someone in the casting.
