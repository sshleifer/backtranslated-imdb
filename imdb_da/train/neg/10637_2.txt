I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, more objective image and more coherence. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, with no charm or romance, it's just boredom itself. I find the actors also quite weak. O'Donnell may seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably when he gets older, he loses his childish charm, but does not get any charm from an adult. It is not surprising that it was not shown in many countries and sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
