Listen to how hilarious this movie is, I finally rent it at <br /> <br /> the video store and for 75 minutes I may have to laugh 3 times. This <br /> <br /> movie, a collection of sketches that make fun of TV, is a <br /> <br /> incorrect root. The wit falls flat, humor is about issues from the 1970s that are just no longer relevant, and the jokes are going too long (almost like the new SNL outlines <br /> <br /> over the last few years). Yes, the Chevy Chase is in this but maybe at least about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was very <br /> <br /> raunchy and had nudity galore, but couldn't it be fun? Do yourself a favor and hire Kentucky Fried Movie, which is a far <br /> <br /> superior movie made in
