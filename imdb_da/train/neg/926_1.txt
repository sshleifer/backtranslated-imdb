This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator brought back from the dead to call Tyrannus, a gladiator to be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn after approx. one hour, also called Demonicus. This adds the much needed depth to the manuscript and questions our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus completes his little to-do list (kills some people and says repeated sentences in Latin) by possessing the body of a university fired. He uses a magical mind-control helmet to do this, which the college boy willingly puts on his head, and then on several points in the film, takes it off and sits down again. <br /> <br /> Maria performs oral sex on a poor man's Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to CG fire in an old concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Totally accident. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. See it.
