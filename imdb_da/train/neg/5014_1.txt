The film has the longest, most tortured and agonized ending of any movie I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, it starts right after the opening point. January Jones gives such a wood performance, I was surprised that she didn't come up in flames when she came close to the lights of the movie. I can't really remember her from the other movies she's finished (a blessing I have to believe. I never criticize an actor's performance because in movies there are too many things that can affect it, but in that case bad that it really stands out from the ATROCIOUS script. Granted she has given lines and situations Meryl Streep would have problems with, but I sometimes swear shes reads from a cue map of sets. At other times she might actually think learn the handicapped or slow in some way For real! The reason, dialogue and pacing are just as bad as you will ever see, but there is still no excuse for this performance or for the director who lets it be committed. of the other actors. Terrible intentions / 10 little indian / breakfast club pushed into a proper burrito and then resumed by a class writer instructor, take it back, it has Studio exec crayola over it.
