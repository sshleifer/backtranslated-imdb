This movie was out of faith. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before the start, the theater owner started up and told us how half of the audience had left the theater the night before, which happened to be "world premiere". I don't think anyone in the theater understood just as badly that the movie should be at that time. We all understood at the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a documentary, although it was kind of sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and disgruntled to Bettie Paige, where half of the movie is actually just remakes by old Bettie Paige movies. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the contents of the 90 minutes are below par for the least to say. A scene would start going when someone would say "wow you are so good Bettie, why don't we make another movie." this would be followed by a 5 minute by a Bettie Paige remake, which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring) the normal part of the movie. At the end of the movie, people were laughing every time another Betty Paige movie remake came up. It was so ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in that theater, but people were not laughing at the filmmaker, they laughed at the movie and its poor content and structure. It was easy to tell, as the parts that would make the most laugh were those who were to be serious or revealing. <br /> <br /> I know movies are expensive. I have seen many cheaply made independent films, but somehow film and movie quality put it from everything else I've ever seen. The movie looks like it was made for $ 12. The cuts, the grain and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. This movie does "Dude, where's my car?" looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater as if we had just paid $ 8 to be tortured. The only redeeming part of the experience was that we should laugh about that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. Apparently, the last night, "world premiere" at night, was director / author / producer in the audience and had to see people laughing and going out on their movie. Bettie Paige's films were destroyed. They should also destroy this movie.
