CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most overrated, over-the-top, over-everything clutter I have ever seen coming out of France. There is nothing worse than a French production trying to make films in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror / action / buddy flick. I stopped almost halfway through because I knew it wouldn't be anything but French guys trying to show. <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising, as a kind of expansive horror movie, but it quickly switches genres, from horror to action to x-files type to buddy flick, that ultimately CR is the whole thing and nothing of the. It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought it was a comedy. The painful dialogue and the silent pause, with fades out and fading right at the right exposure moments, made me moan. I thought only movies made in Hollywood used this hackneyed technique. <br /> <br /> The chase scene, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so exaggerated and over-done that it's almost a thing of beauty. The Climax at the top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation of the killer (s) with Cassel and Reno, who played "friends" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely derived the little credibility the movie had then. <br /> <It is hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also instructed GOTHIKA, who had his share of the problems, not even coming close to the horror of this overcrowded, confused movie.
