I created my own reality by going out of the theater, I was roped in by my boyfriend to go to this boy with his mother. We (my g-friend and I) walked about an hour into it. What a lot of pseudo-scientific jargon. <p> <p> <p> Subatomic particles are thoughts? Tapping labels for bottles of water and blessing it from a Buddhist monk did they grow small beautiful crystals? A drop of 25% in the murder rate in DC happened when a lot of people meditated. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone ate cheerios for four days at the same time. Should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a decline in the killer? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW - It was funded by the Ramtha cult whose leader was one of the "experts" interviewed by the filmmakers. No ulterior motives here, right?
