This film fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross-cultural love story backed by the mid-20th century / pre-World War II India, where the British and their modern ways are bad, and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good. Surely such clich√© pictures of the British are quite passable now. Apart from the drama that burns the second part of the movie, the story is predictable, the actor is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the guide is obvious and imaginative. The story really needed to get rid of and would certainly have enjoyed another half hour of the screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel an investment in. All in all, pretty uninspiring. Oh and Linus Roache just can't do tragedies - crossing the eyes with emotional pain just doesn't work for me!
