DARK REMAINS is a low budget US horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to involve 2 separate threads. First, a woman commits suicide by pushing her wrist while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her neck cut. The mourning couple decides to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later turns out that the cabin and surrounding places are haunted. <br /> <br /> As film continues, the two separate strands of history eventually converge, which one can reasonably expect. However, the execution is random and results in confusion that may only be solved by multiple views. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not tempting enough to attract most viewers to see it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to comment on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The poorly written script introduces to many people without giving them an interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror films such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS have not paid much attention to J-Horrel's style. J-Horror seems so effective because it plays for fear of the unknown. Tensions are created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera approaches it for example) and the reaction of a central character facing it without any warning. There is no humor or heavy-in-kind element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you cannot help to be convinced and fascinated by it. The prehistoric atmospheres set the tension and ensure that the horror has psychological consequences, much unlike the "spring scares" used in Hollywood movies. The DARK REMAINS executives made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The greeting to J-Horror could have been suitable. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the listed "scary" on the screen. The make-up effects of the "ghosts" were not so bad with the low budget, but their actions just rejected logic. I traveled my head a few times during this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't give away the end even though I wanted to. I simply couldn't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What's back? The answer that a reviewer on another website has pointed out is boredom. The film is a task to sit through. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. But most will probably turn off well before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only 2 positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scaring clichés and the absence of the "f-word" in every sentence that one would normally expect to find. This is what the 2 stars are for. Those who like supernatural or psychological scare associated with ghosts and haunting like to stick to movies like LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGING or J- If you think you've seen too many established movies and want to see one fuzzy ultra-low budget "R-rated" horror movie about ghosts, see DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the biggest horror movie ever made, but it is much better than DARK REMAINS and has a few real surprises in the store. I advise everyone to avoid darkness remaining as troubled.
