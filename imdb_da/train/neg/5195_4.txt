I had heard (and read) so many good things about weeds that I was looking forward to joining another great cable series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it was slowly destroyed with every episode I saw from Season One. (didn't make it past the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was unoriginal, constructed, and depicting black embarrassing. The dialogue felt compelled, as the authors try too hard to be clever and hip. It was a rare moment when I actually left an audible laugh. The people never developed enough to break me, they were selfish and unpleasant. I HATE HAT the addition of brother-in-law (who should have been removed to catch a predator) and the removal of Hodes' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and clich√©, May I conclude that the authors tested the viewer's loyalty. <br /> <br /> Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in history. <br /> Add to that I heard that season two was not so good so I lost all motivation to continue watching this play. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suppose this show will be a challenge for you to suffer unless of course you are stoned and then all bets are off.
