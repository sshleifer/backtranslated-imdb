I'm a MAJOR fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really "good" bad horror flicks. But these movies have nothing to guarantee it looks !! I don't want to spend much time talking about everything that's wrong with it. <br /> <br /> Scripture is horrible. The action is horrible. FX is not even worth discussing. "Set" is an absolute JOKE !! The sad thing is that I think there may be some real potential in a few actors, but this vehicle left them nothing to work with !!! <br /> <br /> It was enough to say I saw it "free" & feel I was robbed !! The time you would watch this would be better spent flossing your cat.
