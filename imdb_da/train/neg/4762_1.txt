I saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand. The reason was horrible as there was a great lack of information. The movie did not feel "The Fight of Wits" feel to me. The actors just spat out the nonsense, and at times I caused my teeth to rub in pain when they drank again and again. The plot was predictable except for the gummy homo erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic, but made me physically ill in my stomach), even the ending was predictable. And you could tell the detective that Jude Law was in a costume, everything from the fake accent, horrible dental care, costume shop facial hair, all pointed out that it was a disguise. The whole movie just felt like a waste of time out of my life. This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine popping and the house as the window to watch the show, and that was really my view.
