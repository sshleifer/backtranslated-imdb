I honestly had some high expectations when I first started watching this movie, but it probably turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the pace is incredibly slow so it works much longer than it is (and it's not short) .I'm sure that when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long , filled it with description and did not intend people to read in a day, or it can pull and lose that appeal, which "Emma" certainly did. Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this error at a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> That brings me to error # 2, of course that actor. Although I am not able to watch just about anyone involved in this movie, I am sure they are capable of good work, but I did not see much in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be "overclass", too hard to be British (yes some of them), so they all just came out as a bunch of actors and not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, seemed only actors, and not actually the people they played. Maybe it's good because the people they played really weren't so nice. Why did everyone look like Emma for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, beautiful people in front of them, but she was a terrible gossip behind her back. If her friends were "ugly", she didn't even stand behind her back. So why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to make her laugh?" Of course, the snob could not even do the right thing. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" didn't change my mind. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see that I didn't care about this one. I'm sure it's a nice book and all, but some books aren't really meant to be made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
