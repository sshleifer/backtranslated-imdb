Student Seduction finds hidden by Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley across the desk and attracts the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. When I speak for myself, I can truly say that no teacher ever saves, did something to me hormonally when I was a student. It was a Mrs. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay child, I could see what she was doing for the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had that could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley in any way. <br /> <br /> Corey is the hotty he is, also accustomed to having his own way with women, whether they agree or not. That he comes from rich parents strengthens this belief. He flunks chemistry, which is what Berkley teaches and holds up his GPA, she agrees to guide, but no longer believes. <br /> <br /> So when he tries a rape and refuses an answer, it is detrimental to his ego. When Berkley leaves the channel and reports the crime to the police, police remembers the case of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just not here. Sevier's parents aim to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy. <br /> <br /> Student Seduction, which is a misnomer of a title if ever there is one, is waste all the way. By the way Berkley took for Showgirls, this television movie was not an upward career movement.
