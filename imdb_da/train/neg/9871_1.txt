and shot in Vancouver with the 'mountains' in the low country South Carolina visible in the background. For heaven's sake, they must have reset the location. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period. <br /> <br /> Lame visual. They should have been beautiful. And the story lurks together. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand why it was a hit like a book, although I have to admit it's one I haven't read yet. Usually I read the book and give the film a miss. There was nothing in this movie that made me buy the book, or even borrow it from the library. Rating: The mermaid chair seemed rather shallow.
