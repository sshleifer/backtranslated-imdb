Scary Movie 3 is such a stink party, it's hard to put it into words. It makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material, let's just say it. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was fun, one of the better 90's ghost movies that come from a good team that has previously rocked our world with no threat to Southeast as you drink your juice in the cap. But what the hell happened?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought the cast-and-crew change would help, but it was even worse. In 20 minutes I had the smile twice. Not a laugh, the jokes were reused, and originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that at this point in writing most people on this site voted it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill. When there are big flicks like the School of Rock out that actually have jokes that are * gasp * fun, wasting some money on tripe like this, their head should be investigated. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
