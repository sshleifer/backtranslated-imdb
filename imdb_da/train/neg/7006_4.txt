Mark Hamill should have felt much embarrassed with CORVET SUMMER! This time he uses a new kind of "force" to regain the possession of his dream machine, a bright red "Vette". It looks like another sour teen age flick the first half hour and makes a U-turn toward the wrong direction. Writing and management jobs are terribly complete, with a few scenes that you can hardly take. You expect this to happen anyway, and you also sniff the scent of the 70's hodgepodge. Only a former newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from repo creeps! Her impractical but lovely personality sticks to your interest for good, and this is the best chance to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I think Force wasn't with you this time.
