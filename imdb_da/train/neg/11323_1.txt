This movie will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It's amazing that someone would think that this movie deserved time and investment. I've seen "B" movies before, but the "C" movie has just been invented. I didn't think I'd ever enjoy the Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching, but I found myself looking for videos fifteen minutes in "Knights." High school productions are better than this, and the actors involved should delete this from their CV. Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate who loves these types of movies knocked it off himself. Now it really has to tell you something. If you see this movie and like it, I'll pray for you.
