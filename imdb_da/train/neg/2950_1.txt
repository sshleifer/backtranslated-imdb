I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I saw it to the end is because I teach video production, and I wanted to make sure my students never did so badly ... but it took all my intestinal strength to sit through it. It's like watching your best grandmother flirt with a 15 year old boy ... terribly painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the actual movie, it dipped in paint thinner, so watch it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S-Mart, back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.
