Really, I can't believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had moments ... I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off, but it was about it. All in all, I think it would be more fun to slide down a razor blade slide on my naked nutsack in a vinegar jar, then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boobs, but I had to see the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see it. Buyer beware ... unless you are in masochism.
