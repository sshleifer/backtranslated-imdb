That is good. That's bad. And then their The Sentinel, a bottom-barrel political "thriller" that is among the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is a good, but never a movie with so much potential so completely slaughtered. Directed with skin-handed "edginess" by Clark Johnson, all actors in this movie seem to work with autopilot. Even the big Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I have never seen another movie with so many sharp plot holes throughout my life. The twist is predictable from square 1, and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a disaster of a movie without redeeming value.
