I went to see this a couple of days ago and it's hard to forget that movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie should be fun, it's not a single laugh in the theater (maybe for josé garcia and gérard depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. It was even hard to understand what they were saying. They just talk too fast and don't open their enough to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times, I made myself say after a line that should be fun "what, what did he say" and I am French. I hate to say this, considering that I think good movies are made here, but I apologize in advance for all foreigners who want to watch the movie (if ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are deeply saddened by the cr @ p 2/10
