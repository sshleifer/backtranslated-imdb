No, not the administration of GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove." Lifetime must have realized what a dog was, because the series was burned by two episodes at a time, most of them emitted between. 11 Friday night and 1:00 Saturday morning. As for why I saw it all, I can only request weekly sudden seizures of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most of the casts are unknown, which are likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn into the only decent performances (Jones doesn't make it through the whole series - lucky woman). Ward, by the way, gets older quite well since her "Thorn Birds" days. <br /> <br /> One main thread to the plot - which murdered the heroes' father, who was mistakenly convicted of father's murder but was released after six years in the slam - is stretched out so long and concluded so quickly that you will not be particularly interested in who down it. There are a lot of "steaming" sex, more murders and all kinds of rude behavior - virtually none of them are either interesting or credible. Most of the cast is not very attractive and absolutely not talented. The script and direction are on a par with the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stick to the end, the postcard is a (very small) hoot. <br /> <br /> Consider yourself!
