Blame executive producer Wes Craven and fund Weinsteins for this big budget debacle: a thrash-metal update of "Dracula" with a disappointing verbal jab at Bram Stoker (which probably won't have its name on this thing anyway) and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore. Christopher Plummer looks like Van Helsing in the present - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing; he stays with rents from Count Dracula's body, excavated from his coffin after being stolen from the Van Helsing's vault and flown to New Orleans. This is just what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well-produced, but without a single original idea (except for multiple race victims), is both repulsive and lazy, and after approx. one hour you start repeating yourself. * from ****
