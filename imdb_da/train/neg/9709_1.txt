30 seconds in the opening credits I had this feeling that this would be a bad movie, but I didn't know just as bad. Then the actor, who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend, and I decide that to survive this movie, we must turn down the volume, make our own dialogue and double the speed of the DVD. But it did not help. About halfway we knocked it off. Now I have lived through some very bad movies before, both with and without help from the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only some movies that I doubt, even though Bots can save. The biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized to believe they were zombies, had rotting green skin. I suppose they were all hypnotized in death and then hypnotized to tear themselves. Stick to the real B-movie cult classics like "Plan Nine From Outer Space."
