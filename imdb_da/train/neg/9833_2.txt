False accused John Wayne (like John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change the identities to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is supposed to be "Rev. Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". None of them are as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; Although Wayne may be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career wise. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (like Anne), an adult from her days in "Our Gang", is a great interest in Wayne. She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of low-budget John Wayne movies from the 1930s, this movie won't make you one.
