When you have two tower houses of artists facing each other, the least you can expect is the amazing companionship, and this is the case in this movie where we have a 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan romance a 34-year-old Tabu. Wait! In fact, everyone in the plot's name instead of "cheeni" is the content that is "Kum" in this Adman, transformed into Writer Director R. Balki's virgin effort. <br /> <br /> Trust two leading actors to bring the house down with their clever cracks and bittersweet moments when love happened in this unconventional couple, and that's all you find in slow but refreshing first half. London's sites caught in the rainy season are captivating. At the end of the first half, romance was completed and mission achieved. There is not much left to be said. Therefore, in the second half comes a strange resistance in the form of the girl's father to the extent that he goes to a Satyagrah, really is a test of patience. There is an odd climax about how he gives. The result, the other half is dry, flat without energy. There is a subplot with a girl who dies of cancer and has little influence. Nevertheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performances.
