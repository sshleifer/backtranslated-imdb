A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear research in the fifties and that he now has the power to ... burst into flames! <br /> <br /> I was really geared towards this movie, how to be directed by the great Toby Hooper and staring wildly short Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the average film of violent powers. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much. However, the special effects are not bad and help to carry the film to the final. <br /> <br /> Cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, no classic, but neither is it the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
