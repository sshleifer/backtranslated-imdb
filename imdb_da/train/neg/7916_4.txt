Where to start? What about the erroneous synopsis: "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epic violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the vicious Weapon X program." <Br /> <br /> His epic violent past turns out to be exceptionally non-violent. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so glamorous that it's hard to understand how they have any connection whatsoever. We are thrown from a time in the opening scene, which shows them as children on the run, to a montage of war scenes that they have fought throughout their long life, and finally to the present where they are part of a hardcore government team of assassins. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to show their relationship as brothers at all. No complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We are thrown into a romance so quickly that it is over before you can blink your eye. After just introducing the character, Silverfox is turned off about fifteen minutes later. We wonder why we should worry about this. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> For a crucial element of this faint-hearted story, romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed in simply because it was necessary. Strangely, when Wolverine finds out that his love is dead, she leaves her in the woods to rot when he goes out to find Sabertooth. Being the romantic, that he is, was not necessary for him to serve the plot by drawing a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> With regard to the weapon X program, let's just say after painful crippling procedure Wolverine is underway. Eventually he comes home to a comfortable old, but overwhelming loving couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not alarmed when they find a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it strange what fate awaits them? In the earlier films and comics, the main reason why Wolverine's amnesia plagued him, is partly hampered by the fact that he was said to be maliciously vicious and coldblooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing this was the case ... would he really remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle to fight the world's villains with his teammates? <br /> <br /> As suggested by X2: X-men United, when Stryker discloses some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known the evil works they committed together. This movie creates the team pretty well, but they do not really do much of anything. No disturbing violence, no ruthless acts, they only harass a few natives in foreign countries for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not at all an evil man under Stryker. Instead, he constantly tried to tie his brother Sabertooth, which was the violent agent we all thought was Wolverine. Eventually he just leaves everything. <br /> <br /> No conflict about duality here at all. <br /> <br /> Idiotic removes the character conflict between good and evil. DULLED the story immensely. They might as well have given him rubber gloves. <br /> <br /> There were lots of other flaws in this movie, which opposed the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the paralyzed Deus Ex Machinas who ever hit a script. <br /> <br /> Magic memory deletion bullets. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> It is apparently the only thing to bring down Wolverine. Nevertheless, this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would certainly not work on him. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants that didn't do anything for nothing at all. Interesting characters were just window dressing and did nothing to the story. Most were in the movie for 5-10 minutes max, and yet you think you want us to see more of them and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (Blob but not the comic version) can beat a launched tank missile with little or no physical damage to him, but a simple headbutt from Wolverine's metal noggin is enough to fool him? <br /> <br /> Cyclops optical beams (which instead of being concussion force are now more akin to lasers) can burn through buildings, but when fired directly on Sabertooth, he simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging His clothes. Adamantium trench coat anyone? <br /> <br /> The (gravity defying) mutant Gambit, instead of exploiting his signature card, is made into a kind of crazy acrobat. In a poorly edited scene, he is unknowingly beaten by Wolverine ... so surprisingly a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running to Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran away a few blocks, climbed a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratch fight is a mystery yet to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some have apologized for this movie's weakness by claiming it was made of a cartoon and therefore should be weak in character and heavy on flash. The idea that this movie is a cartoon movie is thin and superficial because of the fact that it is wrong. The comic book material, the real origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. It does not suck its past or treat the reader as mindless CGI junkies. It's a well-crafted story, and although it was resumed and adjusted over time, we started with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie must be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have the magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
