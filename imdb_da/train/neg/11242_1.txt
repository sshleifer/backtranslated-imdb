I watched this movie last month on a free sneak preview and I went out. It was pretty terrible. In the process of trying too hard, they acted and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed when I felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past, so this couldn't be so far off the mark - but I was wrong. I hoped they would give a survey at the end of the movie so I could tell them they wouldn't release this movie. I was enticed by the free aspect of the previve, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I am usually very easily amused. It tried to be innovative and creative with the shots, ideas and film, but because they combined so many ideas at once, it failed. I'm usually not fussy about movies, and I don't usually feel the need to show my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to see it. I'm registered on IMDb just to tell you all
