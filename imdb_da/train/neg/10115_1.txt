I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this movie. I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I claimed they were making false advertising. It is not enough that the film itself is a p.o.s., but cover art is what sold me. I have made better make-up effects on my kids on Halloween than what the film actually portrays in terms of cover art. Can you say "raccoon eyes?" I don't want to waste more of my time going into the details, but come on, the movie's protagonist is a LA policeman who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent!?! It's beyond insult.
