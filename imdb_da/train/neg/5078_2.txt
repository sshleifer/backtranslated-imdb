If 1977's "Exorcist II: The Heretic" did not give him any favors, it is hard to imagine which thespian extraordinary Richard Burton saw in this killing of non-excitement. You've seen it all before: Burton plays an author who discovered at an early age that he has the power to move lifeless objects through the power of his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no influence on Hollywood!). Although a novel by Peter Van Greenaway has been adapted, "Medusa" plays as a recycling product, although the special effects of the cathedral finale are solid (if they are typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the support support is extremely weak. Burton is hammy but tired ... not even telekinesis could save him at this time. * 1/2 from ****
