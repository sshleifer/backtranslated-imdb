Director Ron Atkins is certified insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also wrote), an emergency job that receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch friend. He begins to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts out as a ball-to-wall utilization film stays as good, but it gets very repetitive very quickly. I lean more towards the certified insanity. It's hard to forget when you've seen it. Just as if Tom Green ever made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell becomes completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows breasts and bush <br /> <br /> ANTI-eye candy: seeing John naked repeatedly
