This movie has received a lot of games during the day on either HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested in comparing it to Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks captain of the same name. The only reason to see it is the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I have to say that Matt was more than a little long in the tooth to play a high schooler. If he were a woman, they would have made him play the mother of the mother's school! (Is it just me, or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teen highjinx played by adults.
