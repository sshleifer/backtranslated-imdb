When the little mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was a kid, I was curious about her successor. The little mermaid (a) is a classic animated feature with top quality everything, a magnificent music score and targeting a general audience. In contrast, the little mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at young children because it is spontaneous, reflecting a child's self-esteem, the music is bouncing and less dramatic, and the ending feels like a recess. <br /> <br /> The little Mermaid 2 starts out when baby Melody is presented to Ariel's side of the family. Abruptly without any visual signs to help the drama, a huge tentacle takes hold of the child. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not fun, the baby gets attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in the broad daylight and her spontaneity removes the potential drama since it happened so quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout the feature, Melody looks superhuman, which I am defending is how most children imagine. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought to the end when she fights Morgana without an inch of fear for her face. As the first movie, Melody has many Ariel issues, except vice versa. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father limiting her from the sea, while King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and the melody rebel against their parent. <br /> <br /> The music is more emotional at first. This sequel has a lot of songs, but not so much orchestral work went into it. It's good for the little ones because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first movie was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a jump song and everyone plays in the water. It is definitely more targeted at children, because instead of the end is solemn and leaves you blown away, this end leaves you thinking: "It's time for recess!" In the end, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them have fun.
