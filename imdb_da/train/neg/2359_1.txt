It should be the last Freddy movie (and it was for over 10 years) - you'd think they would have tried to get a good movie done. But they turned out to give us the worst of the series (and that says a lot). The plot had no meaning (I can't remember it), all the protagonists were idiots (you really wanted them dead) and Freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual. The only good bit about this was a short (and fun) como by Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare" movie was his first). Also I originally saw it in a theater where the last section (reaccounting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well - 3-D was miserable - faded colors and the picture goes in and out of focus. Also, the three flying skulls that should be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYONE broke down laughing. Looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Meaningless and stupid - very boring too. Skip this one and see "Freddy vs Jason" again.
