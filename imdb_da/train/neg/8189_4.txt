It is always hard to have a sibling that does better in their lives than you, always a struggle to get out under the shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. So imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how hard it should be. That's the premise here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the title of Fred, an exasperated loser who spends much of his energy and keeps people from walking around expecting good things to hang with them or giving his brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for simply being the rampant, famous, hungry, slightly creepy guy that Fred wanted to portray him as. Then you would not know that Fred needs a financial advantage, and then you have to do it by helping his brother head for Christmas. And hilarity and life education follow. <br /> <br /> Now it should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie with a few good moments of Vaughn's patented fast talk time, a ridiculous musical moment that is not nearby. Kevin Spacey plays an accountant to close Santa's operation (and he is one of the weakest evils I've seen for a while), not enough of the beautiful Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas suit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit (to be fair, he is a highlight about) and a movie that also swims in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet for schmaltzy in the last half to feel like a fun poke on all the bad things about commercialism of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is together for the ride as well, as it is Kathy Bates, but it's really just a movie for Vaughn, and if you like his style, you'll find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is little else to recommend this seasonal stink. Outside of Vaughn's rantings, the manuscript just changes somewhat, except for a particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin's direction is as mediocre and staid as a 20p Christmas card that you send your aunt you haven't seen in 10 years, and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken, will ensure a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get a burnt, bland lump with too much sugar on top. Forget about it and keep the greeting Elf on again if you want a great, modern Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, Santa Clause 3: Escape Clause.
