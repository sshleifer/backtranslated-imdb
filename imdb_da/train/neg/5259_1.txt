After I finished watching this movie I was so sorry that I had wasted 2 hours in my life. It's 2 hours, I never come back. Ugh. When you start this, you might think "Wow, it's really good!" But be sure that first impressions mean nothing. I was so excited about this movie until the stupid end I've ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The action is bland, the story is anything but original, and there is nothing special about this, except that it is the WORST MOVIE EVER !!! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! WARNING!! DUMBEST FILM, WHEN YOU WILL NEVER BE SORRY, PAY 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS !!! 1.10
