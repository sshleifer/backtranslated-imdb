The action in the movie is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting, everything goes slowly to a big stop. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a good job, so did the other actors I mentioned, but man ... this is one of the worst drawn movies I've ever seen. Now perhaps in a short film form, this movie would be good, but apart from that, avoid it. This film has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never go to movies but watch this at home with the family I went out. Yes, it was so boring. Apparently, my comment doesn't have enough lines to write, so here are some more stuff. I think I was inspired by the movie I was just watching.
