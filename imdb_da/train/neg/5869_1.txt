It has been almost 30 years and I honor ALL everyone involved in this movie. It's still the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I saw this, I never thought of rivers in one way or another. After watching this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally watch her on TV. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to this - against my better judgment - by peer pressure. But there came out of the theater, they swore friends an oath, which never again overrides my choice of film. Almost thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from this movie. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my advances will be the time I wasted and hope this movie might get better. It never did. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a choice, you'd rather put your own eyes out to sit at this movie. <br /> <br /> I signed up for IMDb comments just in hopes that I might warn others against seeing this movie. If I can only save a person from seeing this, my existence on this earth would have been justified.
