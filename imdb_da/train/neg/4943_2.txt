I have seen 3 episodes of Caveman and I have no idea why I continue except maybe waiting for it to get better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is just pumping itself away from the advertisements, without real humor. When we sat around watching these shows, we all wondered what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> The section of women's cave woman with an attitude was actually a great, yes, right for us. She is raw in a theater and works hard for strangers, and the truth is told, she needs a blow <br /> <br /> I consider myself a pretty good reviewer and take everything, but I have to say that Cavemen is comparable to old shows, my mother, the car. I give it a 2, only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it.
