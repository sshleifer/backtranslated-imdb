I bought this on tower records after seeing info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to seeing this. My god where did I go wrong? Now before I give my review, let me just say that I'm a person who can pretty much find good in any movie, hell, I own over 1,500 DVDs! That being said, the underground comedy film ranks up there with the worst movie I've ever seen. I tried to give it a try, but it wasn't just fun. It had no meaning, did not offend anything and was quite stupid. God, who in their right mind believed these pieces of shed were fun? this goes straight to the bottom of the box ...
