I didn't know if I would laugh or cry to see this. Only dependent fans of danni filth could get a taste for this. This must be a horror movie, but there is only bad in this. The most cool scene is the car accident, with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. Just watch this for studies of how bad can be a movie ................
