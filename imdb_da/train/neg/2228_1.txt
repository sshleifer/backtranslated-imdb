This movie is weak, the Box cover says East LA's toughest gang, and it's really Santa Ana's, James Cahill seems like a closet queen taking all the hard guys down the hard Chlo gang. It's fake, boring, pointless and whack, I tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad. It was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video box proclaims. James Cahill was to act in Gay Porn. James is in every scene, he can't act to save his life. The movie has Eva Longoria, which is hot, but James can't even score with her !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt that I was watching Gay Porn and was beaten by the whole movie. James will clearly be with men, but rather then submit to his homosexual desires, he will beat up gang members again and again. His martial arts skills are at best minimal, some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and tear him a new one.
