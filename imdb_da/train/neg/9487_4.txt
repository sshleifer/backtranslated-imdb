They threw though nothing special, everyone does an OK job, the story seems to be a good idea, the manuscript is tolerable and the end has a pretty good twist; So what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> For a start, the special effects are really bad (if it was made in the 60s), it may look good, but in 2003 there is just no excuse for pictures as poor as this. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims very proudly 'from the Jeepers Creepers' special effects creates. Second, the direction is weak, this movie just doesn't take the core of the story, a doctor feeding the hospital's deployed souls to the devil (or demon type creature) should be tense or frightening; It is simply not. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty bad movie, and although it's tolerable and sometimes mildly entertaining, it's still best alone. <br /> <br /> A pretty sad 4/10
