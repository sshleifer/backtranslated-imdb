When I was 11, fat 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerful addictive experience. My sister and I wanted to see it, rewind it and see it again and again and again, until we passed or became too confused and hostile to each other. So if you are an 11-year-old girl and you have been through this movie as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original fat", you have your young adolescent hormones to blame and you can be sure that this relentless If you are not a little girl, however, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that fat 2 was anything but a creepy, unclear, shameless embarrassment for everyone who participated in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism I will dignify the movie now by explaining why it is blowing ?? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical music, the songs should promote the narrative or develop the characters. In Fat 2, with some debatable exceptions, the music is indecently meaningless. Most songs seem to relate to a sex act in an excessive and general way ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin") without making a concrete statement on anyone of the film's characters or themes. Furthermore, the whole music is uncomfortably stupid, and no one in the casting demonstrates even the worst form of ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat sympathetic, but instead each is an annoying vassy dufus loser. Eventually, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird sack and launches him into the band, Michael must kick it to the ground, spit on it, and pounce to throw wildly a part of his body affected by it. But of course he accepts it as being gold, because despite being a bunch of bumbling meat heads, there is no greater honor than being one with the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is handsome, smart, kind, inventive and above average in all contexts (his musical impotence), it is possible that Stephanie would eventually embrace him as he reveals to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie on the other hand is a dull, slap-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, graceless rude and trashy dingbat. So, apart from being beautiful (I think), she has no sympathetic qualities, and so the audience gets no ground for the depth of Michael's attraction for her. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I didn't want to mention the rough inferiority to its predecessor, as there are so many cranks out there that seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. However, I would say to those of you who believe that you will visit this root of old age: Fat 2 is an experience that is consistent with reliving your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kiss a snot-nosed 13-year-old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left to feel dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
