I want to give this movie two stars because it comes with beautiful photography. Otherwise, it is mainly due to clich√©s and stereotypes: Mountain people are either stupid white waste of fanatical religious or rapist racist sorts or wise white Indians. Native Americans are magic people who move around without sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds over long distances. Etc. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I wondered what the meaning of the movie was (except showing me beautiful pictures of mountains, log cabins, forests, an assortment of animals, spirited mountain dwellers, and freaky people in the church). <br /> <br /> The reason was a lot of issues but explored none of them in depth. Nor was it a story of growing up during the depression, nor about being orphans or a struggle for identity. It tried to be all these things and more, which made it shallow and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is about Little Tree's education, we learn almost nothing about it. He received a brief summary of his people's history (which was brave and stoic) and a distillation demonstration; tried his hand to chop wood (where he failed) and whiskey races (literally); learned to read (and perhaps write) using grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently, he didn't learn much during his fate in the boarding school because he was in the attic. <br /> <br /> But Grandma and Grandpa and Graham Greene characters made sure Little Tree eventually became a very spiritual person whose main goal was adult - after, and I switch here, "riding with Navajos" and "to get caught in a couple of wars "- should" catch up "with grandma and grandfather and Graham Greene character in heaven (instead of saying dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense). <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I have to say that I found the grandfather's trade offensive. Why would everything still be a whiskey? To counteract the stereotype of the "drunk Indian"?
