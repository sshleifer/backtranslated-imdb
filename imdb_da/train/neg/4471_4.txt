The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was mildly fun at times and that it was an appropriate time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is also so annoying that I wanted to turn these characters around. This is the kind of movie that is so cute, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but it becomes terribly tedious when the dialogue is so nauseating. When the two leaders are not on the screen, it is not bad at all, but be afraid of the frequent moments when the loving couple start talking to each other.
