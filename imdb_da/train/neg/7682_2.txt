Exhibited in 1955, COBWEB is an all star cast from silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to Actors Studio's offspring SUSAN STRASBERG. Put on an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about you, wondering ..... high drama? Doctor and patient relationships? Shock therapy treatment? No, it's about who exactly is going to pick up the drapes for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm making fun? You won't believe in your eyes as you see this incredible story that turned into a movie! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants all the hospital's patients involved in the design, selection and execution of the necessary new drapes. McIver's wife is played by marble mouth GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get her 2 cents on this monumental task too. It also does a long time employee Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by the VINCENT MINELLI, you ask a little about whether he really became this too involved in small details because of his marriage of concern was Judge Gearland. Talented actors such as LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story. What did they think?
