I think everyone was very disappointed with this sci-fi flick. First, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing is a remake of what should be a classic. I found it boring, rough and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone at Imdb says it's crap and boy, they are right! If you don't, avoid it. It's a string. 1 out of 10
