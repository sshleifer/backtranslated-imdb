<br /> <br /> I recently considered this cruelty in my movie program, and I thought it was terrible as I said in my tagline, it was pretentious, tired, petty, and phenomenally self-meaning. <br /> I consider myself a fan of movies and all the things that movies have to offer. If I want to see a documentary at the Cannes Festival, I will see A&E .... and they would probably be much more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend, period. <br /> <br />
