Another American Pie movie has been pushed down into our throats and this is the worst of them all. It does not deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie feels like a stupid porn movie, which they titled American Pie. When I saw this I felt like I saw another series. It doesn't fall like the American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes, so the other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it ever. In fact, I do not recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just stick to the lovely original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
