It may not be the worst movie Peter Sellers has ever done (I think the laurel goes to "The Fanger of Zenda"), but it's probably the most depressing one. Sellers, especially Sans Makeup like Nayland Smith, seem to have just undergone chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, he hardly looks and uses most of the movie (except for the strangely disturbing scenes where he is hit by electric currents) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of the makeup. The supporting players also look tired and down, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (A bright spot: This would be one of the last times a big movie would portray Asians as insulting ... or for that matter star a non-Asian as one!). The movie seems surprisingly inexpensive, with soupy photography and killing sets - though the whiz-bang Elvis number at the end looks cut-rate. Only the amazing Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous guy who gets his pants wet, adds some sparks of life to this sad affair. All in all, this film gives an eerie sensation of a great cartoon death and an even more honest evidence of his death.
