Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women." It's annoying episodic script with three story lines patched together is ridiculously bad due to predictable writing, horrible plays and even bad music. I found the anorexic protagonist disturbing to see every time she was on the screen. She needs fast food. Use the 90 minutes you want for this turkey, do something more exciting ... like trimming your toenails. You will have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing about this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. It is just as impotent as the older guy she dishes in the movie. <br /> <br /> VIEWER SAFE!
