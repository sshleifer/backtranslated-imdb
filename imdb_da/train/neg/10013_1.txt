A worn plot by a man taking rap to a woman in a killer + the just worn plot of an outsider on the inside, which is eventually closed. <br /> <br /> With such a unique case, one would think that the film would rise above its chopped origin. But scene after scene drones past without intensity, no character arches and inexplicable behavior. The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary - or on the other hand completely unexplored. It seemed to be included only to titrate the viewers. When will Hollywood learn to have gay characters not automatically make a more compelling image? <br /> <br /> An unfortunately horrible movie. When does Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected her and Kristin Scott Thomas better. This is definitely one to miss.
