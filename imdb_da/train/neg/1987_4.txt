This was an excellent idea, and the landscape was beautiful, but this is where it ends. It looked like an alarmless Set It Off meets the West. The reason had hardly any meaning. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There might also be unnecessary things that did not relate to the plot or did it help to further the story. There were also long blind moments where the plot could have been explored, but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the director. I had a big question mark on my head and looked at this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you are just looking for the eye candy then it's the movie for you.
