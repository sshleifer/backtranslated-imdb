This is one of the cheaply made television films where the characters seem to lose all sense. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son of the boy's father, is very good. But the story just seems to be begging faith. When the mother is advised not to do anything, you know well she must. It is a bit far fetched and not worth looking at.
