I suppose any novel that is as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find a great benefit of depression era audiences who had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie is a prequel to the main story we know, not that much of it was held to the movie. We first meet Ahab Creely (he has a surname and a brother) as a happy, lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett, the grandmother's daughter. The brother Derek played by Lloyd Hughes will also marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in one of the best performances. Barrymore hadn't really mastered the sound of the cinema, and he released with all the silent histrionics plus a scene voice that would have shaken the barriers of any movie theater this movie played in. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab Losing his legs to the big whale Moby Dick, and I have to say that the amputation scene was pretty cruel. Of course, that was all before the Code. Still, I am sure that the 1930s crowd shaking. <br /> <br /> Then tell the story of Ahab's hunt for the whale, which he thinks he has something ugly in Joan Bennett's eyes. It's not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was invest the crew on Ahab's ship Pequod with personalities. Other than Queequeg the cannibal harpoon names are there but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs may as well be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
