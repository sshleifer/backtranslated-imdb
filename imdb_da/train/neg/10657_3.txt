I had many hopes for this movie and saw it with many expectations; basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is a wonderful actor who has marked his footsteps in the time of the sand forever. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, the brutality and violence of tenebra and clockwork look far better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very bold police officer. Who is assigned a study of brutal serial killer. Raghavan effectively finds the connection yarn in this case and is close to solving the murders and putting the psycho-killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but they avoid and re-enter a killing. Finally, Raghavan kills them both after saving many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> Those two psycho-killers are the ones to keep the audience from going to theaters. The murders and sexual harassment and rape appear very explicitly, which the film could have survived without. <br /> <br /> For yourself to imagine that teens and children should watch this movie in the theater and the kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds, is certainly not beautiful. Director Gautham realizes that he also has a certain commitment to society and his audience. I never go to the cinema and look like Gautham's name on the production list.
