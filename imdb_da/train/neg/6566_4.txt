I saw this movie after having had so much trouble downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say it didn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so hyped that I was really looking forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of the films that fails to meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he came from America. The direction lacked quality many times, except for some intermediate scenes. Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure they'll make a thought blower movie out of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It just wasn't good enough.
