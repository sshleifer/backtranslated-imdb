East Palace, West Palace reminded me of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of policeman, and William Windom is the boy. It is a progressive film for China, but it also continues myths about gay men's femininity: it is made very much by Chinese myths where men take female roles. The film focuses on a successful man who desperately wants to be dominated and wounded by a macho guy. He crosses the park without fear - he hopes to be taken to the station house by the officer. And that actually happens. Then he tells the officer all his life story while being exposed to mild torture: made to fuck at a time, handcuffed, beaten. That is what the gay man wants, and implicitly the homosexual man challenges the policeman's self-image as a male man. The story of gay life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerable, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It is a shame of shame for China's homos, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.
