The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agencies in the world should watch this movie for information on how to spy on people. (as MST3k comments it ... "Sanata has dirt on everyone! Santa's Tentacles reach far and wide! There is no hide from the Klaus Organization") From telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA doesn't have Santa on pay. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is fun. Pitch ... he's so useless. The cheese factor in this movie is huge. Very low budget but so fun to see. I recommend looking at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even more laughs. <br /> <br /> You even get a laugh at the good children's accident. <br /> <br /> I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
