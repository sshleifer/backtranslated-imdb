I rented this flick for a reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but it was a real disappointment, I had terrible clich√©s, half of the movie were naked women, so-called "fallen angels," running around trying to act scary, oh and so there was occasionally "Blair Witch" black and white movement sicken camera scents. Tom's character was really horrible, horrible script. And you must love these lines they use. "Is there anyone out there, it's not funny" No, but your play was. I wish I could give this flick a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they left Anthony, The Breakfast Club reunited in the woods of unforgiving plays.
