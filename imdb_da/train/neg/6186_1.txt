Misstatement happens. Susannah Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. Edward Rochester must be 35. White-haired George C. Scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80. Jane's late uncle is in better shape! He smashes and spins, uncomfortable and gloomy. He looks like an ax killer who sent his ax out to be sharpened; We are not surprised that he is holding a wife caged in the ceiling! The great love story resembles a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is probably darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when he chooses to be. He has a fine voice and singing voice, a good mind and a conscience that he tries to stifle without success.
