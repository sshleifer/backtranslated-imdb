While I totally disagree with a reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny, he is definitely in this movie. It's a shame as I suppose the other reviewer must have seen only a few Charley Chase duds and assumed that the guy wasn't fun. Movies that are VERY SIMPLE AND WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good Chase movies, so he could be really fun with good material. Unfortunately, in this film, he has given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil is no help because the basic premise (boy will marry the girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame as I would really love this movie, but couldn't. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who used to look for Charley from the mid-1920s, you will be beautifully surprised as Chase sports no glasses or mustaches - and looks very little like you would expect.
