I noticed with little entertainment that at the end credits, detroit PD is thanks for their participation. The police chief even has a talking line that plays himself (and boy, can you tell that he can't act). The reason for the amusement is that in this film the police shoots first and asks questions later. Not the kind of PR I would think a police force would have. Apart from that, this is your standard police and robbers movie dressed up to the 70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco has a reassuring role as a lifeguard policeman who cannot move on and is left with a mentally ill wife. He clarifies this by hanging out at the local headquarters. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner who has a groovy wardrobe and likes to hunt for suspects while wearing a trench coat. The movie moves on to the penultimate shootout that gives absolutely no meaning (why do people who are only guilty of robbery a whole police?). Not only do we see a shootout, but since there are four bad ones, we see four. Then there is a twist ending that should leave a guess what would really have happened, but only left me thinking how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind Braindead's "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I shouldn't have wondered.
