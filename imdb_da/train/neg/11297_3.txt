Jenny Neumann (from the sexploitation girl MISTRESS OF THE APES, the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who plays a leading role in an Australian stage production. She is a virgin, because as a little girl she saw her mother sex and accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. In the meantime, a sweaty murderer snarls around the theater, which strikes people up with glass cuts. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The murderer is, of course, Helen (she speaks in her dead mother's voice, washes blood from her hands after the murders and is seen killing a nanny with a broken bottle like a little girl!) but this has free pov-breathing POV camera work and hides the identity of the killer until the end, which should be a great surprise. The whole cast seems to be obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even harassing their way to getting laid. There is a little nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, the photography is creepy, and editing (by Colin Eggleston, who is also scripted and produced) is terrible. The theater setting for a slasher film takes place at Soavi's movie with the same name and Argentos OPERA (both are better than this) with five years, and Neumann is pretty hot.
