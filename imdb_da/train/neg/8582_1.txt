Image as a sort of sequel to The Full Monty, about vacant men in Sheffield, this film is a fake. As someone born in Sheffield and still with connections to the city, I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Someone said it could have been put in Oklahoma, and it sums it up for me. This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the American market. Probably many Americans - and many southern English people - do not understand that Sheffield is a city of about half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture. In Amongst Giants, it was portrayed as a boring blind town in the small village where everyone in Sheffield seemed to be drinking in the same old-fashioned pub, and where people's idea of ​​a party was line-dancing in a village similar. This was a small close community, not a big city. <br /> <br /> The working class Sheffield men were quite unequal to their real colleagues, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks. They do not speak and they certainly do not sing in choir. <br /> <br /> Even the rural settings, apparently in the Peak District, saw me strangers. I recognized a couple of places where I used to go hiking, but some of the pylons' air photographers extend beyond a gloomy landscape reminding me more about Wales. In fact in the credits at the end I found a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is in summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars. It lies between two big cities. It's not a kind of desert. <br /> <br /> Regarding the idea that a young woman could fall in love with, and desire, Pete Postlethwaite, it was ridiculous and could only have been a male dream. Her reasons for becoming his lover were never highlighted. None of the men were shown as a partner or family; they existed in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone wishing to watch a movie about unemployed Sheffielders would have been diverted. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of middle class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a giant fake! <br /> <br />
