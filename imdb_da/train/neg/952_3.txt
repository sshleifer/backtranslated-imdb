Happy Go Lovely is a waste of everyone's time and talent, including the audience. The ease of the old hue of wrong identity and faux scandal plot lines is extremely forgiving. Very few people saw these movies for their plots. But they usually had some interesting minor signs involved in partial plates - not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dance and captivating songs. Not happy, go nice. And Vera-Ellen as the female leader played the whole movie like another banana that desperately saw a star playing it - and instead she was encouraged to wear the movie and couldn't do it. The Scottish locality was wasted. Normally automatic ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent. The photograph was pedestrian. The musical figures were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance and chews up the landscape as no one else has participated in the type of production role often performed by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is just fine, and no one could make David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you love Niven as I do, it's enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
