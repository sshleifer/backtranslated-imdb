Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES were fun, but this low budget regulation makes me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (the poor man's Kevin Bacon) runs around Mexico with a surfboard house a hidden room that holds his vampire killing all the Antonio Banderas guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up some lame "hunters" along the way (including an annoying feminist-infected girl taking pills to stay away from being a vampire), and they go out to stop some female master vampires who don't get any backgrounds, and then we could take less care of her or her quest (to go in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to let her do it). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this and done a lot better. John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he's past his primary and unable to make another horror classic. The only decent movie he has made since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap right up to the incredibly cheap looks and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this is a waste of celluloid. Where are several greats like INJURY on PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THING? <br /> <br /> Carpenter crony Wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper script wrapped with yawns, moans and recycle grids from the original. Did I say I hated any character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character throughout the film. How does that happen? This movie has nothing to recommend it. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> By contrast, Jason X: "Friday the 13th place" was a masterpiece. Now it's how you make a sequel and (energize) a franchise, ladies and bacteria, and create an exciting DVD menu.
