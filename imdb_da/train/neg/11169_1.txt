Are you kidding me?! A show that highlights a person who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented should you be to do this? She may be able to cook, but it is NOT portrayed in this half-hour gastric ulcer painful production. I know she has a Martha-Stewart esquire empire. Warren Buffett also does, but I don't see him with fake knockers that open creams of cream grain and Alpo. <br /> <br /> She has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about a name that's stupid. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "table-scapes" than actual cooking. Who has that kind of time?! Silicone must be on your spatula, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
