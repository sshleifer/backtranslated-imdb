I had high expectations for this indie, who has reviewed the many thumbs up reviews. So .... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional 'two cents' for the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Location: Morgan is "stuck" in a dusty little town where he meets lovely Scarlet who works in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help raise the lovely Scarlet from her trailer's garbage game? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? DOES NOT. How about shopping in Target. First, Freeman at the Target interior looks like he was entering Harrods. Then he is thrown onto a T-shirt rack that confirms that he has never been to any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as pleasing in his ignorance of all and everything in Scarlet's life. One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and ex-hubby battle scene where her survival, a car in this case, requires that she physically attack her ex hubbie. Running freeman for her defense .... naw ... he is cubing in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a dumb aspect of her very real, boring mass in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that a car wash and a new, highly revealing, tight-fitting blouse is the key to Scarlets job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'scene talk', where every aspect of Scarlet's reality is reduced to some stage related Freeman experience was annoying. <br /> <br /> Freeman has the right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then ignores the brick she faces vis: uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, very poor, no family support and a lifetime of low self-esteem. Scarlet teaches such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse can open doors instead of her lack of education and white collar skills. In the end, Freeman Scarlet offers a little more than strange diversion with a 'star' and doesn't even pay for gas for Scarlet's death day returning to its unchanged life in a city that Freeman doesn't care to know.
