Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I didn't like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very poor music, even worse actors (apart from SRK of course, even though he himself can't manage to save the movie), and not much sense. The director makes it all look very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make it look very surreal and yet credible. Now he doesn't manage either. <br /> <br /> Even if you have few hours to lose, don't watch this movie, thank you! (Say this to your own welfare!) Continue searching, find something else to see!
