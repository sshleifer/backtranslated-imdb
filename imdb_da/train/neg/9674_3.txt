This flick reminds me of some really bad science-fiction films from the 50s and 60s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, cheesy and stupid. Special effects are ridiculous, all actors are ridiculous and the end is simply horrible. waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey quite entertaining because of its stupidity).
