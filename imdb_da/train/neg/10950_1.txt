If I had known that this movie was filmed in the enchanting and quease-inducing Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took a dramamine for seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before I gave up. It's just boring, pretentious twaddle. The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was also pretty gloomy, but at least the camera was stable and not breathed into the throat of the characters all the time. I am amazed at the continued popularity of Dogma 95 abroad - it will catch in America at the same time as the next major outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95, because it's the average number of times the actors have encountered in the eye of the camera.) <br /> <br />
