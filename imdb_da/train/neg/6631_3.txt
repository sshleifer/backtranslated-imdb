Ram Gopal Verma has proven to be a very innovative and competent director. He had made a remake / rework of godfather with sarco and succeeded enormously. Dito for Lolita, which he made as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay has been the movie he has repeatedly inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake. <br /> <br /> The play ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan as appropriate scary as the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were terrible and forgettable. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came out as another set of music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the pacings and dialogues - which were forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching movies in a theater, I found myself waiting for the break, and then to the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the film's duration. Ultimately, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma.
