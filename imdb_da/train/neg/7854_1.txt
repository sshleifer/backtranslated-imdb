wow this is the worst movie ever. The only reason I signed up for IMDb was that I could complain about this movie. I've never gone out of a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped this one (and I should have). but I saw all the way to the end just to come down again with a completely horrible ending. wow if this is all that is required can produce its time is long. I have never seen the first one and never want to see this. its terrible action with a terrible plot. hi see someone shining a mirror with us let's check it out. And the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD, it was completely checked out on blockbuster forever. so i feel bad for all the people who saw this junk.
