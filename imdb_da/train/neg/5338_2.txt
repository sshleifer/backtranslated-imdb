Elvis Presley plays a "half-race" Native American ("Native American") to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons. Everyone likes to be full, fight and make children. Combating, wrestling and "punching" each other replaces the stereotypically enforced expression "How"? Although he has make-up, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he appeared in previous films; Perhaps he was ready for his famous "comeback". It couldn't have been because this movie script was something to be excited about. Joan Blondell tries to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in "War Paint" must be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "Green Sleeves" with various texts). The most embarrassing song is Elvis' love song for the bull "Dominic". There are some surrealistic scenes, but it never gets trippy enough to succeed in that genre; Although "Stay Away, Joe" might give something laugh if you are in the right "mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
