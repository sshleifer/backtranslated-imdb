Spoilers will be in this. The movie could have been better if they had just had another script, director and CGI provider. Not much right? The movie has a man who starts his own amusement park ... er ... zoo on a desert island where people can see dinosaurs ... er ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I don't care about rip-offs because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies, but one just beats you in the face with it. R e p e r t e l y. There is even "the shadow of creation on the design" thing. The Sabretooths that are not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park (Just Old Killing Cats) is pretty rude, but the fighting performance is the one I call "Sloggy". Because after a disposition of a big cat is a hero, relax a little because there is only one left. Enter the weird feeding guy who says, Nah, we made three, the third is a monster pulling around with its feet. Big, groovy. A group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt that is tested to get into their clich√©s frat or black (Always thought there was a short nickname). Out of those who live, only one has completed their task, so I got a kick out of it. Oh yeah, the obligatory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" Clique is in force with not one, but two of them! Mr. Primal Park's death is the most ridiculous thing you want to see in one of these movies, as a Sabretooth statue is barrel-loose (Courtesy of Sloggy), shrinks a few sizes and blames the man through the neck. If I had just gone away so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
