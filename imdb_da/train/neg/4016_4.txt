There is a DVD released in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, not ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inner edge. <br /> <br /> Probably a straight transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is not much point commenting on an adult movie. But this one contains a minimal plot and the characters are credible. It was shown in the US in normal cinemas. <br /> <br /> I've seen it in Pensylvannia right back in 1975. As such, it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a VHS tape as the source
