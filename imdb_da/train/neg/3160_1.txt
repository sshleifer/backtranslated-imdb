You know you are having trouble seeing a comedy when the only entertaining parts in it are from the treasure. It's a shame when parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support and not the other way around, as the people in it were pretty scary all the way through. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what kind of name is it), Jason, & Lindsay, I would forget about this actor and do something else as everyone is as funny as watching paint dry and horrible actors to start. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the movie is one of the characters shouting, I'm not Gay, which is fun as if you weren't the one you can change if you had to set up with the three bossy, boring and dry say very ordinary women in the movie. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen this year, and hopefully I never saw that bad again, even though I didn't expect it.
