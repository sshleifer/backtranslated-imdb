"Giant" is one of the most boring, far too long Hollywood contraptions ever. Many scenes work completely fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. A central notion of this movie that a ranch would ever resist drilling oil on his land is absurd and I know because I'm from Houston. A few scenes, especially Dean serving Taylor coffee, redeem this otherwise boring movie. For a much more accurate and interesting idea of ​​how modernism changed the ranches in Texas, see "Skin" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show".
