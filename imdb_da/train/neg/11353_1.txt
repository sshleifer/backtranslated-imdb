Today I visited an Athenian cinema with my two children (6 and 8 years), paid 3 x 12 euros (about 45 US $ in total) not to mention gas, popcorn and sodas, were asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and "forced" to see what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece, but only proved to be a sick "war war as" propaganda film that no one I've seen in the last 20 years ... AND IT'S SUPPOSED To be a movie for children ... in the name of heaven! PS 1: The average Greek does not work more than 850 euros a month (about US $ 1050) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My kids liked it ... but then again they are no more than babies> on Greek: mora, morons> like the one who wrote the script and the others who made this "3d disgrace". <br /> <br /> PS 3 3D animation is great, but who gives one ....!
