It may well be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie is not even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then it is completely downhill. We have Hitler's father cursed his own bad luck on the "fact" that he had married his niece! They were actually other cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called his father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois had been adopted and brought up by Klar's grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara, and so as a child she used to call Alois, uncle. <br /> <br /> The scene in trenches where Hitler mocks his with soldiers and decides to put it on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to all viewers' intelligence. We see Hitler chasing the dog through the shooter as he tackles the poor thing he continues to thrash it to obey him. In the distance we see and hear that his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the feuded little man, but then a shell comes directly to his persecutors, and every one we are told is killed directly. How did Hitler tell the scene about the only person who survived the scene? Has Hitler himself "boasted" about it? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Next up, Hitler bullies and scares a poor, stressed and belligerent Jewish officer to give him an iron cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a farmer's dealer before he fought for the fatherland and had wisely brought some pledged medals from his shop, for I am sure iron crosses were not disclosed as shown in this comic dad. <br /> <br /> All the grotesque clich√©s are here, not least the soothing and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on hand. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" would probably float Fuhrer's boat than any "Flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's gun! <br /> <br /> Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he ever be forgiven for his terrible taste in music? <br /> <br /> I could go on but I would stay in it for hours. Give it a miss.
