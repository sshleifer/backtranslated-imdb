Before I comment on this movie, I just looked at YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked out was to look at something I first looked at the TV ads in 1980: Barbara Bach's split. And when the film got an R-rating, I expected to see her naked. Alas, no dice to her or the other beautiful actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager, but was actually 20 when she did this. Seeing her in a bra and panties and later in a belly dancer was just as waking as Mrs Bach. They give some of the scattered laughs this movie gives. In fact, I do not claim Ron Leibman to get his name removed from the credits, as his role as the tight-fisted Liceman is rather embarrassing, although I liked the "seduction" scene he did with Mrs. Nelkin. This also happens as the debut of Ralph Macchio, who is the single family among the mishaps sent to an academic school. The others are a black child who really loves his grandmother and Mrs. Bach, an Arabian who carries engine oil, and a politician son who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin's character) so much, he risks sneaking in the middle of the night watching her in the girls' academy. Among the supporters, Tom Poston plays a swishy character named Sisson, which I found partially amusing. With a play by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and direction of Robert Downey Sr. (If son Robert Downey Jr. has a como early in a football scene), Up Academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor, but unless you are really offended by the scatological and sexual content, this is actually a rather harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and its trademark cover boy-Alfred E. Newman - should not be ashamed even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture. .PS Another of the "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my birthplace of Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
