I own this movie. Not by choice, I do. I was really bored the other day and the box fascinated me. So I popped it into the old VCR and spent the next one and a half hours of my life crying "why God why?". The story was not as bad as a player I could appreciate. I think maybe if you are in super geeky-cheese romantic scenes you will enjoy this movie. "I've always thought of myself as a Vulcan, you know like Dr.Spock ... unable to love." There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really awful. But if you are really making movies, this is for you !!! However, the real story is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I were to sum up this movie in a word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
