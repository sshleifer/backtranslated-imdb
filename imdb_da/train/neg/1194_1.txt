I have seen many movies in my life, but not many as bad as this. It's a movie that makes fun of cool people, has no real story, has bad actors, is not fun and much more. Is it a movie you want to watch? I don't guess! <br /> <br /> I guess the filmmakers were trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was made by a 12-year-old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all. The so-called fun parts are as fun as soaking in people's faces or by breaking the wind. If that's the kind of humor you like, then it's the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie!
