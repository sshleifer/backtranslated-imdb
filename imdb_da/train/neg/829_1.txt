I heard about this movie and knew it wasn't really good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and was interested. This could be a really big, dark black satire on today's morality in the media. The little featurettes on each contestent were good. It builds something I will not miss. But when the so-called show starts, everything becomes impossible, cheap and pretty stupid. Here's where the author should have added something that would make people think. But instead it is wrapped up and assumed that people are stupid. The end is so bad, I give it a 1. Although the movie starts promising.
