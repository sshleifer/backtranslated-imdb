If you really want to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be a boy. But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio. Having seen such a good movie as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they come up with again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but nobody seriously looks to work on Indonesia's image in the entertainment world. The fact that it is a "global" world does not seem to be in the minds of those who make film in Indonesia. And as the Indonesian public turns off everything presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with a taste of the West, they get away with it. <br /> <br /> Okay, the story is nice to begin with. And it could have turned into a nice flip. But did the instructor never think that a musical first and foremost needs live music or at least good play, and secondly, good choreography? In this movie, playback is so bad that it makes you cry right there in the cinema. Each and every word you hear follows later on by the actor or the one who blames the playback, and it is extremely annoying as you watch the movie. The choreography is as if they were planning to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but ultimately thought it would be nice to make it a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. It's almost not dancing you see, they are jumping here and there, throwing their legs up in the air, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> At least there's a happy end ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a good candlelight dinner is much more romantic, do it!
