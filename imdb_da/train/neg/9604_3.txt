First thing I noticed in this movie of course was the unnecessary amount of nudity. It does not give nudity or anything, but much that was not necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman who believes in her families, ghost stories, that her ancestor, who honestly looks like her, was a werewolf and thinks their destiny is destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was supposed to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man, you should never look for extra buck or two. I find this concept for someone who is not really a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately, it's not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead we know shes not a werewolf from the start, so there is no excitement or twist, and they also try to make the movie seem like this really happened scenario. They also fail to add one or two parts of the film that refer to this as reality. First, I was excited to read the description of the movie. But I realized slowly that it was a cover so that they could only expose the protagonist's breasts as often as possible. Annik Borel is either a decent actor who plays a great psychotic role or a really bad actor plays a psychotic role. When the character Danniele does not have brains and is just a nut running around crazy and spinning and snapping like a wolf, it takes a little skill to play. She has moments where her performance breaks through for a scary moment, but is quickly destroyed by the poor camera work and light. The idea is great, but hidden throughout the film. 3.10
