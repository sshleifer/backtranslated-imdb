I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movie that others are raving about - or I write the review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this movie almost unmanageable, and it was unusual for me to speed up not only through boring, clichéd dialogue, but even boring clichéd music tracks. Regardless of originality, in this movie - unusual home-setting for a musical, lots of imagination, some animations - is more than offset by a script that doesn't have an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Gardens and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but cannot carry a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. They are both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is beautiful one-note. The best part of the movie, for me, is June gardens beautiful costumes and big body.
