Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic game about a man who has to visit his dear husband and make everything go side by side. The original film played Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has the Olivier role in this version and he is mated to Jude Law. Here is the film directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The action is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles. I really like chemistry and the collapse of personalities. It's wonderful and enough of a reason to see when the script's direction goes haywire. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter dialogue is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the game (which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like). The problem is, how the script moves the characters around is terrible. Michale Caine goes through her strange modern house with sliding doors and panels without any good reason. Conversations occur repeatedly in different locations. I know that Pinter has done it in his acting, but in this case it becomes boring. Why should we get the couple to go over and over again and over that law sleeps with Caines wife? It would be okay if the law at one time said enough that we have done this, but he does not pretend every time is the first time. The scripture also does not move Caine well through his manipulation of law. Initially, he is blindly angry to start, so he has no chance of turning around and scaring us. (Forget it too late in the game's revelation, which makes you wonder why he was bothering). In the original we never lost what was up. Here we do and while it does make an edge, it also feels somehow false, as it is so clear that we are forced to wonder why Milo's law does not see him being created. There are a few other cases, but to say more would give away too much. <br /> <br /> Thinking of the film in thought I think it's a movie of missed opportunities and mistakes. The options that are wasted are the chance to get better fireworks between Caine and Law. Misconceptions know that choosing a garish setting and odd shift in plot take away from the creation of a thrill and a credible thriller. Instead, we get a smart dialogue and good performances in a movie that doesn't make them right. <br /> <br /> Despite some amazing performances and witty dialogue, this is only 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work
