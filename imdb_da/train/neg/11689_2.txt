I have never seen any of Spike Lee's previous films since their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen and admire Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work and have several of their DVDs. However, I was totally disappointed with this movie. If this movie is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to "get a job" and stop wasting time and talent with others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators saw the same movie I had seen. I can only say from their sappy lovelorn that their worship of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this work. I paid only $ 2.50 in a "Second Run" theater, and I still felt I had wasted my money. The IMDb "Trivia" page says it all ....... <br /> <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How to Expect a Big Budget "Blockbuster" (as Media Hype Promised) in such a short time? No wonder there was so poor performance for everyone. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard was first to lead the movie ..." - Perhaps he has done this project a little justice, given more time to do so of course. Although the writing was horrible, the premise had some benefits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. Pardon! This movie was so abundant with pitiful clich√©s, incredible scenes and miserable characterizations that even he couldn't have done much of it. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed his part in three weeks." - And it showed! Her depiction of a "Fixer" that makes people's problems go away was as incredible as the script she got. Would she even be there? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would generate to get to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were robbing the bank, and he would rather stay away. .. or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) enters the bank to check that there is no equal, how many bank robbers without a gun would have "led" a policeman much less "let "a policeman" back out to the front door so the police officer could go behind him? <br /> <br /> * That. Frazier later claimed to have given the robber "every reason to shoot me". Why didn't he try to expose the robber's face in a short fight? It might have got the answer he was looking for ... a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (the accomplice of the robber) so long to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda and didn't want anyone hurt. But the police had no reason to believe they wouldn't. For them, it was a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys went out to "pick up the pizzas", they were not taken down. (First of all, how many robbers would have come without using hostages as a shield? Is this Spike Lee's version of NY City or SNL?). Taking them down would have reduced the number of evil guys, screwed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would probably have given up. If not, at least there would be fewer villains inside. (Give SWAT something to do or send it home!) Which police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just roll right into the bank and discuss a question with the robbers that she would not pass them on first? She had no authority, no government credentials; and secondly, was it still a "guessing situation" that added another? <br /> <br /> * Why didn't the bank manager (Christopher Plummer) just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds he could have sold. <br /> <br /> * Who was the "schmuck" (the character, not the actor), with the Jersey accent who conveniently, voluntarily and said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian", but yet he himself could not speak it ..... SIR! Put your hand down! And his ex-wife! What a "schlump" she was !!! Both were amazing. <br /> <br /> * When questioning suspects, why did it. Frazier has always harassed the individuals who apparently were not part of the hoist? (Ie to tell the older woman she could go, and then she could not, then could not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that hostages put on bounce suites, could not derive their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * At the end of the movie, a fake wall was built in the supply room, behind Clive Owens hid from "a week" .... where did the materials come from? (drywall and studs). It should also be assumed that they cut the sewer so that he could relieve himself. The bank's employees hadn't complained about the smell all week long? Hi! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; Since the documents "had" fallen into the hands of the robber, what kind of "references" was Mrs. White, who expects to come from the banker, as he should now be a target for blackmail because of her failure? <br /> <br /> * And last, but certainly not least, what about "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? How stupid! Was it supposed to indicate his "release" to bring these guys to justice? Rather, he looked like a man jumping on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than the mediocre plot; miserable script; bad acting; and overall miserable conducting ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will provide enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />.
