The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different story lines do not feel like a complete piece, making this comedy a very incoherent and just getting annoying at times. It may sound faint and clich√©, but it is true; You're better off seeing the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It is more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. I am sure both the cast and the crew had a lot of fun making this movie, but the film does not give us much pleasure. For a comedy, it's simply not fun enough, and Steve and Terri Irwin are just not good actors, not even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make a whole movie around, and their scene feels long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times. The film had the right potential, I think Steve Irwin is a sign it is strangely interesting and fun to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about the 'crocodile hunter', my first reaction was; brilliant! However, the movie suffers greatly from its weak history and the incoherent story lines of uninteresting and unfunny characters. The movie has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie appear for at least once, but I certainly do not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie as a waste of time. Still, this movie can only be seen once when it comes on TV, on a rainy afternoon. It has some good moments, but the story lines really ruin the movie and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
