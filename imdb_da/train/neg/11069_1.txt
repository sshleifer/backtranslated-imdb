I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I was watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I don't understand what they were thinking when they did this. It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer's murderer and it has no end. It almost felt like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a television episode of the soprano. It suddenly ends, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. It also felt like I was just looking at part 1 for a two-part movie. There are many opportunities for what went wrong here; They were lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story they wanted to make a Dahmer 2. After watching this movie, they all sound very accurate. I saw Jeffrey Dahmer through the woods. Suddenly I hear this music playing, so writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer earned 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by an innate and killed at the age of 34. Wow, he walks in the woods for his death in prison . How about showing how he got there. How about showing Dahmer's attempts. How about showing more details. I can't even explain what happened in this movie because it ran everywhere. I actually found myself in disbelief, "That's what it is the end?" I would like to conclude this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made. For the filmmakers I would like to say if you have to do it, do it right.
