This must make me one of the worst vampires ever seen by men. How can one make such a fascinating topic a totally uninspiring story? Apparently not such a difficult task ... First of all, a conditio sine qua non from any vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this lacks all these things .. Too much light - the spots! Oh my God, why was it in the name of Christ / Judah? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula came, he was consumed by light (in the manuscript to keep him weak, for the record: Just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth seeing near The film's ending (beautiful dances with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first, the Judas twist was defintely original, but this one is just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third will cary the vampire signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even the interview with the vampire.
