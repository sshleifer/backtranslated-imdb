I don't envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black to make this movie. It's in a word boring. Perhaps it is too predictable that the more than exploited Ben Stiller's losing role or the non-in-all fun scenes makes this movie just something to forget. Even Christopher Walk's appearance ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's play. I loved it in most of his films, the last I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and wasn't that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, except for High Fidelity, I've never seen him do anything good. What about the Rock of Rock? Ooops, scary.
