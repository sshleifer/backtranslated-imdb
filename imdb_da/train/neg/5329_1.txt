As a true Elvis fan, this movie is a general embarrassment and the script is a disaster. The film opens with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and the Grand Canyon scene gives viewers hope for something special. Elvis comes on the picture and his talent is wasted much time, especially on the remaining songs. I sat through this movie twice to make sure it's a piece of junk !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
