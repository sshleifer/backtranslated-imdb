This is the only movie I've ever seen that has asked me to write a criticism on any site, and it's an important statement from someone who likes "Monolith Monster Attack." This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an unofficial movie. It is eg. Without sex and violence. I think this movie is safe for kids of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged or stimulated in any way. Adults could easily catch up with their sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie. But don't be surprised if you wake up to find the kids, you've turned on the television and started a board game. As an adult enjoying being entertained, who enjoys everything from the secular to the amazing in realism, drama, comedy and action, all the adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to offer.
