Enough is enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is far dead. The first Tremors movie was great. The other was ridiculous. The third was nauseating. The TV series was depressingly horrible. And this movie just runs the stick deeper. Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppet shows, now we have the series in the wild west of the 19th century and they are struggling with grassroots. As a rehash of the first, they must learn to beat them again. Less entertaining I assume. Otherwise, this straight-to-video release, like Tremors 2 and 3, just goes too far. Oh, and I continue to wonder how there is never an overview of these events taking place ... did they just forget to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be history making, so our friends in the first movie would not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this that destroy the original just make me crazy. Avoid this waste.
