This movie is pretty boring. There are excerpts of naked meat thrown around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake, but they do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she does a masterful job that handles her character, but Day-Lewis rolls most of his lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The inconvenience of jumping between households / marriage problems and political crises is poorly adapted. Character attitudes change without explanation all the way through. Poorly disjointed.
