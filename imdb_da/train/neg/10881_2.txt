My friend's mother used to work on a video store and had to watch movies before they came out, so when she came home The Convent, a horror movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Considering that it has to be scary, but it is actually fun, I can say that I somehow like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the play is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so funny! "WHAT DO YOU TAKE CA-RACK?!" i didn't know this movie was ever released ... i figured it was too bad ... yeah so ... in general the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit so much to at least) but i promise you you will get a good laugh out of it. <br /> <br /> * This movie is a little cute, but it's good to laugh ... especially the guy who holds the "dagger of despair" .. THE DAY OF DESPAAAAAAAIR!
