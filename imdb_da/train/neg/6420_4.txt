OK, I will admit it started very pleasantly and well, but then it just fell downhill, I can't believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could have even finished reading the script after approx. 5 minutes in the movie, the only reason I actually put through the whole movie, I would watch the twist down, and to my surprise, good people I can't even tell you if there was one because the end just leaves you confused, and So the credit role was I like what hell? This did not deserve a theater race, I apologize, but that did not mean it was terrible, the only reaso I gave it a 4 is because it had some jumping parts ... that's it! you can see, i'm not telling you, hey you can even like it or even love it! But if you hate it, don't say I didn't warn you!
