I passed this one on the shelf a couple of times and looked at the countless great positive quotes (with small names) on the front page and wondered if I was missing something. The second night it was on one of the movie channels and I voted in. I missed nothing. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only looked the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie will be the next comedy gold. Considering the slow, burgeoning pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt. <br /> <br /> The protagonist starts the movie in classic "I don't know how to start my movie" style, with a long, tiring monologue on how he doesn't want to be sued. It is not fun. It's not even extremely fun. Others have commented on the "San Franclisco" piece; Ok, a little chuckle the first time he says it. Then he laughs it in the ground, smiles at the camera, as it is the funniest thing ever written. Get over yourself. In fact, I think talking to the camera bit was the reason why I immediately disliked the movie. Don't get to know your audience. Knowledge is definitely like respect. From there you have pretty much a fat, whiny guy who speaks in a very simple way about his boring life as a temp. I didn't realize he was Jewish; It is a discredit of Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor." It's just unfunny humor. Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you have a good chance of the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job with self-analytical humor than this guy, so of course it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I had seen had worked, I could get stuck. But some schlub continues with how much he loves the names of the women he works with and notes them for five long minutes, doesn't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Don't be a victim of target marketing. Just say no to "Haiku Tunnel".
