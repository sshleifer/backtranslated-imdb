This show seemed pretty good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like politics, but somewhere in the production this program went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the authors should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time !!!!! It makes it boring. The protagonist is incredibly annoying and it is not credible in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean stupid and a bad boss. The crimes are uninteresting and bland, and it's just paralyzed all the way. As mentioned above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a big disappointment and very bad ...
