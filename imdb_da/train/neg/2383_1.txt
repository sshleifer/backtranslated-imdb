This is a candidate for the most disappointing movie experience of my life. Cold title, excellent instructor (I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before this), and hi - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that's a question that struck my temples for hours after I saw this turkey. <br /> <br /> The inconsistency and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a death zone for a movie that should be avoided for any price. Its critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one of the rare movies that does not contain a single redemption quality. Zero out of ****.
