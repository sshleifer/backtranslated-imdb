The main problem with "Power" is that it also contains too much meaningless characters and subplots that do not add absolutely anything to the movie. It gets boring after a while, sitting around waiting through scenes that do not connect to find something that drives the movie forward. You can probably surpass it all as character development, but all are either reused from previous scenes in the movie, or are simply just plain and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the offending blossoms bloom. He should have cut a few of the characters (hackman, wife) and concentrated harder on others (Billings). It could have been a big, hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of ​​bad writing and action, a fact that surprised me considering the cast. Even the Gene Hackman performance was not up to each other. Denzel Washington is the only real actress here. Gere and the others have all made much better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet has to go back to the fierce man he showed in the seventies (ie Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe ". It hasn't worked yet Sidney and it probably will never. Leave the ensemble lines to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
