Not a `women's movie 'but movies for the band. One of the worst movies ever made by a male instructor about woman. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman. Tops of bad taste, American Pie humor style, raw history, no sense, futile story, rejected characters. Vulgar fantasies came to life on the screen. Insulting and definitely not fun. I wonder how three good actresses agreed to participate in it.
