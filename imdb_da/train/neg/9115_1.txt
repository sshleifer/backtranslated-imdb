If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G. She's a real, naughty, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she's just a little fool hanging around. She's nothing! People don't love her! Second, Sebastian was sweet and warm in the first movie, now he is "baby face". The story is not so good and I do not understand. Why did they first make this first, that is the beginning. Loosy actors, nothing with history. This is not cruel, this one plays. The first one has better actors, better story and its average. I think the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. It is not the worst movie I saw, but in comparison with the first one is the big, big, big nothing.
