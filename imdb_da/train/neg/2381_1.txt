I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is something to pass by. I had expected something better from Uma Thurman, which was why I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. A horrible movie with only the music as a redeeming quality. It's just a shame that we're not able to give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
