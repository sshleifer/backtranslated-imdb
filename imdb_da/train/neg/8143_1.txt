I had the particular dissatisfaction with watching this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I've been to this festival for over 5 years, and I've probably seen some bad movies at times. But 'First Bite' has reached a completely new low film. In spite of being shot in beautiful places, with occasional, exquisite close-up of fabulous food, the movie tells an excessive amount of plot and styled characters until I almost prayed for it to end. <br /> <br /> The main actor David La Haye failed to show any character development throughout the film and depicted a pompous cook from start to finish. Additional sub-plots, such as eating disorders, were developed so poorly and completely did not fit in any context that the film had shown up to then. <br /> <br /> A mysterious theme was used as a bad attempt to hide a movie that does not achieve anything, goes nowhere and completely disappoints.
