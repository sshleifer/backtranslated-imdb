I haven't seen this movie in ages, but figured I would comment it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intensively is burned into my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was no price to begin with, but at least the distinctions had to be 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Highlighted Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens 3) Be a relatively painless way to blow in a hour and half of the time. In comparison, the 1994 edition comes across so little more than a vanity piece for the then red, warm Alec Baldwin, and his soon to be divorced wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split shortly after their version of the movie was made, and you can see the image Baldwins at their marriage councilors and explain who is the stupid idea of ​​making this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's just get it said out of the way - Alec Baldwin was never and will never be close to Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this recovery irritated me so much is The perceived arrogance on Baldwin's side assumes challenging our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. As another points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the movie was a satire piece designed for the sort of parody, action / adventure hoist genre. Unlike Baldwin, Bassinger & Company seems to try to produce a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsen's and James Woods' slimy unconventional scoundrels coming out like real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also definitely a means of spiritual and unlikeable at a basic level that is difficult to put into words. A view was more than enough, not just because it had nothing new to offer, but because of how it was made artificially. In fact, Peckinpah's film was a stylish little entertainment that had an optimistic mood, with this version being a hit that takes too long to correspond to little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency for its existence, and some of the more unpleasant scenes are so unpleasant that they make the movie difficult to enjoy. <br /> <br /> So, I don't know, it was probably one of those movies that helped initiate the wave of senseless, artistic, rapid budget remakes propped up around a then-name brand actor / actress who in itself is not a really good thing. I would always prefer to see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie and fall flat with something original. This movie just got me pulling my eyebrows out, and it reveals that over the next 15 years since it's released, Mr. Baldwin became known as one of the greatest jerks in Hollywood. Thank God for "Team America" ​​to put him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
