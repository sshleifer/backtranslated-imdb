someone needed to make a car payment ... this is really awful ... makes jean Claude's cyborg look like the wind ... it's an hour i wish i could sue to come back ... luckily it produced seriously somnolence ... from which I fell asleep. how can actors of this caliber create this dog? I'd rather spend time watching algae grow on the side of an aquarium than part of this horrible collection of more genres. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 by walmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really need to, wait until they throw them out after they have carried them in the store for years and are frustrated that they would not sell. For love for God, let this movie die of turmoil.
