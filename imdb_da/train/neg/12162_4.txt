This is not horror as the first part was: This is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. As in so many successors, the action starts immediately without explanation. But there are breasts so I don't complain. And real breasts are there. If I understand correctly, they are quite rare today among teenage girls in the US of A. It is my opinion that the main role here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> This can't be thought without the first movie, so I'm comparing it to that. Again, for small clothes (mainly pants) and fun hair, it's not hard to tell which decade this movie is made in. Again, there are really strange signs, this time even more visibly "pathological". Specially tenant's staff. It's like a mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older: Most of the players must be at least 25, but I think they should be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. In fact, this movie doesn't have much in common with the first part, and it's worse than that in every way.
