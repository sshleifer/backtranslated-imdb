there is no excitement in this series! When an episode ends, the actors are so light, the effects are so bad, and the manuscript is so terrible that the last thing in mind is how Batman and Robin save the day. No, the last thing is to see the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't see how it was ever made, let alone released on DVD! Of course, the effects are not up to the current Batman movies, but even the script is terrible. An incoherent babblende mess on some evil professors and a jet gun or something like that, I'm not quite sure because it's too terrible to follow. See the 60s version, or 90s versions, or even Batman Begins, just about this version!
