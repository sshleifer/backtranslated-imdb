I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) The host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: "I saw the keepers helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo "and" I'd better not mention the gay mafia if I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) Surprising winners: Nobody had Adrien Brody down for best actor (True Applause ) or Roman Polanski for best instructor (Genuine jeers and angry), but they won <br /> <br /> Last year's prize ceremony was not that bad, but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING celebrates the award, although it was not the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what made the BBC cover down was Jonathan Ross, who got some of his sycophantic feeds and pretended they were funny when they were something though. So when I heard Sky making coverage on British television, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make the connections, but instead we joined Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh gawd if British television is desperate for film critics (of course they are) I am sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers <br /> <br / > Chris Rock wasn't that bad, but he's no Steve Martin, while the location seemed to look like a sports hall with seats set in! Not much of a glittering arena in my opinion. The main problem with the ceremony was the format of the "smaller" Oscars handed out to the winners sitting in their seats! There is nothing like a "smaller" Oscar, and just because the prize is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design, they are just as deserving as best picture or best director. All winners must be allowed to march up to the podium. What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy will be, and I totally agree with the comments that this format is shameful, and if it wasn't for the surprises, this might have been the worst ceremony in history. Regarding the prices themselves <br /> <br /> Best Entertaining Actress - Cate Blanchett. No big surprise for a competitive category <br /> <br /> Best Support Actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints, as Freeman is one of America's largest live character actors. Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. Most predictable price for the night. Grass <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. Great surprise when everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win right down to the academy policy, but Swank deserved it and gave the best speech at night. Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Great surprise when everyone thought Scorsese would get the prize simply because he had never won one. In fact, I'm happy about it, because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR. Best Movie - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Again another big surprise since everyone believed that the Academy would split the prizes to best director and best picture, while I thought Hollywood's friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB's controversial topic would have much of voters <br /> <br /> What these prices might illustrate is that voters this year have decided to ignore Oscar politics and really give out awards to people who deserve what they haven't done before, I mean A GREATEST MINIMUM BUT THE CALL FOR GIFTS! And long, the academy must vote with their heads instead of their hearts
