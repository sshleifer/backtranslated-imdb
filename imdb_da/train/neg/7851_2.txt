As has been said countless times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is NOT a remake of the (generally ignored) mid-80s successor to Wes Craven's 1977 original. But if he wants to give this postmodern sequel-to-one remake the official stamp of Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (a double threat with his son, Jonathan) has decided to pen a movie of the same quality - in pure English, AWFUL. Former music video director Martin Weisz takes the clothes from Alexandre Aja and is clearly heading over his head - but one wonders how one could have created a cool movie from Craven's Writing 101 shading. Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of Goofball National Guards men sent to investigate turbulent hills in the original remake) completely unpleasant and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls (the game without a lick of irony, remember you), but they constantly breaking jokes that are not funny. Having seen their total infinity during a training exercise, their destiny against the repulsive, roaming cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this timeout - as in the original 80's successor - is the script so simplified (almost non-existent) that any potential subtitle is jettisoned in favor of ante ante in repulsive shock (we are treated with a combination birth-kill during the opening circles plus a free rape for those who did not broadcast the DVD at the midpoint!). Even the mutants in this outing are personality-free freaks without memorable stature - the sticky, gummy makeup FX seems like the rest of the movie trying to hide its face from embarrassment. I really moaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja's otherwise excellent movie, and the producers literally go at the end of "Hills 2", which sets the stage - very lamely sets the stage - for a third installment. but Cravens and Weisz have created a movie that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions work that they would be hard pressed to find an audience after this abusive face flap.
