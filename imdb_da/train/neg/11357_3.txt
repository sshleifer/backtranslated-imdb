1. The good news 3-D is spectacularly well done and they do not go to gotcha gimmicks. The film is based on the true story of the pinnacle of human history and even contains one of the actual participants in that story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now meat in the case: It's about FLIES, for crises! Flying with large, googical human eyes, true but flying anyway. Remember when I looked like the "Underworld" movie for rats vs cockroaches? It was not meant to praise, and I never dreamed that anyone would take it literally. This has even less empathy to go after it. Baby maggots? Ugh. In one of the weird mixes of Hollywood groupthink, this tab was obviously on the drawing boards at the same time as "Space Chimps", also about critters in space. <br /> <br /> Hire a "Apollo 13" and see a 9-rated film about the REAL space program (RIP).
