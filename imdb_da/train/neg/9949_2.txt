This movie could have been so much better with a script rewriting. Not that I expect much plausibility in movies, but you think even the homeless and resident Jack Mason would question why a group of experienced hunters wants to hire him as a hunting guide. And after reaching the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T plays its role as if he actually leads these men through forest, he has never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie was based on Richard Connell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". Some years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after reading the story. I reedited the movie, screamed out all the pointless scenes and the whole profanity. It ended up being 43 minutes long.
