Redundant, eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you find in this movie. In other words, it seemed to me technically. The musical bits are amateur-directed (no synchronization in the dance, poor post-synchronized, poor and overt improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The movie is long and boring. Eventually, it does a few points and even less sensible. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good ideas. Some of the comic elements are actually effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse so it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand at the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, it's not true for the movie. That is, the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off.
