Williamson's accent is hard to wade through. He speaks incredibly fast, as if he's in a hurry to get through the lines. During the soliloquies, he seems as if he is talking to someone as he is supposed to talk to himself. All that and his bald spot just irritated me. He was just too old for this role. By reading other accounts of Williamson, he might have this role because he was angry and the director decided to do some life-imitation art or forced method-making. When the actors declare Hamlet angry, you think so! Marianne Faithful is a wonderful beauty and can tie Ophelia's role and still get a passport. The set is dark and preventative, but it looks like shot in a real castle, especially the scenes in the tunnels / corridors, where the dead king shines like a big light in the sky.
