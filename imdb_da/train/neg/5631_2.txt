The shooting on the DVD is so dark, I thought the screen was dead. I think I missed seeing half of the movie. Still, it was poorly designed and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but I was not involved enough to look after the first couple of frames. I rented the movie specifically for Willem Dafoe and was sorry it wasted his talent. I do not think that Giada Colagrande has studied film enough to develop a large film picture. She is attractive and can develop into an actor, but she did too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationship did not seem credible. I do not understand why the other characters were even introduced to the plot.
