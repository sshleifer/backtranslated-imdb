This is a mildly interesting late 80's gore party with some unpleasant snails with a taste for human blood. If you can get past the ridiculous of it all, you can actually get a little less enjoyment out of this. The action is horrible, and the plot is simply there to keep the film together between gory slug attacks, but the movie is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are actually pretty good and gore is well done. It reminded me of the reconstruction of the Blob, probably because of the slenderness of it all. All in all, you can definitely do worse with an hour and a half, but I don't suggest seeing this movie unless you have a strong stomach and are in this kind of thing.
