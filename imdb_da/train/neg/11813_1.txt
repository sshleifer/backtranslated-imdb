Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the biggest comedy team, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a number of cheapies, many of which were parodies of great Hollywood features. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rock's smaller (and more intimate) production company. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's parody films were only mildly fun at that time and even less fun. for modern audiences who have not seen the original film that Laurel is parodying. 'West of Hot Dog' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot 'em-ups. It is marginally a particular parody of 'West of the Pecos', an oater released two years earlier without major actors. As "West of the Pecos" was never a great success, it's hard to see why Stan's movie unit chose this movie as a target for their lamp architecture, much less why they waited so long for the release to parody it. And where did they get the title 'The West of Hot Dog'? Possibly it is under the fact that "Hotdog!" was a sexual interjection favored by American lechers in the 1920s. (As in the opening scene of the stage game 'Machinal'.) <br /> <br /> The 'West of Hot Dog' was produced and co-registered by Joe Rock. Among his many other achievements, Rock Laurel introduced Lois Neilson, and he was subsequently the best man at their wedding. Full Revelation: In the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him. Nearly ninety years old, Rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he didn't remember anything about the 'West of Hot Dog', and I can't blame him. This movie is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The leading lady character is called Little Mustard: If it's supposed to be a parody of something in the "West of Pecos", I don't get it. There are a few "impossible" gags here, including Laurel's horse mounting method. In a moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke into a race. 'The West of Hot Dog' is vaguely similar in the subject and tone of Keaton's short comedy 'The Frozen North', but Keaton's version is much more fun. The plot of this movie anticipates a situation in the Keaton's function 'Our Hospitality' but (again) compares: Here, two fierce warmth brethren expect to inherit the last chance room, but the former owner has brought it to weak budfoot Stan. But the brothers become the legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, though: is such a body legal? As soon as Stan holds the property, any further ownership or inheritance issues become his decision, not the previous owner's decision. I had plenty of time to consider such points of law while I was looking at this boring comedy. At one point, a gag involves some green animation that is drawn directly onto the film layer. It looks cheap and is not fun. <br /> <br /> This 'Hot Dog' is no waving and no winner: it's just a whiner. My rating: a point out of 10. Hang on, Stan: In a few years you'll be half of a comedy legend.
