That's the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves. I will not bother to note the basic errors in this movie as they are so obvious they go without saying. Little things like this are "Laurel and Hardy's all new adventures" despite the stars having died for over thirty years when it was made. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons, just called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it is, it could have worked. For a really bad idea, try to cast two actors to make up the duo. Okay, they can claim to be nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be fun. Okay, forget it, his wacky alien "Cousin Larry" schtick in Perfect Strangers, and look at him in True Romance. Here he stinks. It is probably not all his fault, and just as the instructor and the support - all better than the material - was probably just desperate for money. There are those who claim the Americans have difficulty mastering an effective English accent. This cause is not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stan's trademark yelp he comes close, but since the yelp is exaggerated for tedium, there is nothing to write home about. Gailard Sartain does a little better than Ollie, even though it's like saying what's worse - getting into the dog's dirt or kicking the knuckles? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with their split-second timing, intuitive teamwork and innate love? Well, it's completely absent, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes, so suspect you could park a bus through the holes. Where the originals had plots that could be summed up in a few panels, one has some long-lasting Mummy hokum (and what a miserable title!) Mixed with the boys' fraternity scenario. I can't claim to have seen every one of Laurel and Hardy's 108 movies, but I think it's a safe game that even their nadir were leagues in front of this. Perhaps the biggest problem is that originals were kind of playing themselves, or at least using their own accents. It at least felt natural and undisturbed, unlike the rugged caricatures Pinchot and Sartain are given. And since then did Stan malapropism, and so many in it? "I would give you a standing cremation"; "I want to marinate my friend." Stop it! <br /> <br /> Only remarkable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L&H cartoon. Of course, Harmon bought the name copyright (how confusing to see a Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty. <br /> <br /> Issues abound. Would Stan and Ollie make speed if they lived today? Would they have glass mummies with broken bottles? Did Stan taste in the genitals with a spear and end up on a big CGI finale? Let's not hope. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think it was just in disbelief at how terrible it is. Why was this movie made in the first place? Who thought the decision makers liked it? Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute disgust, I got sick to look for just the first five minutes. If just as fun as having your head caught in a thread while a red-hot poker and prickly sneeze is heavily inserted into the back.
