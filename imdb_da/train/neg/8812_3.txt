Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes. Where's Blade When You Need Him? While it's as gloomy as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as a nightmare as a BOISE MOI, DEATH CREATURES are almost as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak films. While the gratuitous cannibalism could make Jefferson Dalmer's heartbeat race a little faster, it was almost not as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it as interesting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might endure this, otherwise for none. I was really surprised that this was not made by the people of brain damage, as it was the quality of the dead beings.
