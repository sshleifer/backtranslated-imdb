A trooper is on the side of the road and ensures that every1 complies with the speed limit (doing his job); he then pulls over a woman who appears to be a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he tells her what's wrong and BAM ... they are killed. Okay, this is the start of what I personally thought would have been a good movie. When I watched this movie in the theater, I was with some friends. This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and watch a good movie. We all decided to see a thrill / thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. I'm not just wasting $ 7.oo on a movie, but I had to torture my brain. This movie started with mystery and excitement and I seriously thought "it can't be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it doesn't make sense; Though you can get past the bad play, the "not so scary" story, and all that horrible mess this movie was, you will still be confused. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, because no-one with a brain can understand what this stupid movie is about. Right now you can think "Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it is as bad as this person says it is". GET THAT TAKEN FROM YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW !!! I'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you it's so bad that there's no point in considering it. Please people don't make the same mistake, I thought this movie has potential ... it doesn't. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero, I would) and I do not recommend anyone to watch this movie, you will save yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. The freaking movie is all about.
