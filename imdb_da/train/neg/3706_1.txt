I figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guys acting like Chris Rock and then watching Chris Rock respond to people's reactions. Instead, you just see that Chris Rock is himself and people who don't understand him. There are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick. This should have been much better.
