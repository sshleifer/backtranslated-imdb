This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I actually expected a bad movie, but I was surprised to believe it or not. History is the traditional, all clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half-dead actors try to make it sound right. The picture is not too good, the music is so wrong, it has actually made me angry, the actors do not even try, even though the script makes it almost impossible, you can expect more from people who have acted for 30 years and the so-called action scenes actually manage to lack the actual "action". <br /> <br /> I don't understand why these types of bad movies continue, who finances this shit? Where is the screening? And why on earth do the actors make this impossible script? <br /> <br /> There is a million Hollywood movies in this genre without even wanting to reach theaters, but even those Straight To Video things actually look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything positive about this except for the title that explains everything I feel robbed of 2 hours in my life.
