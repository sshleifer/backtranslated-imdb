I rented this movie yesterday mainly because of the great art and the summary on the back of the jacket. After breathing it into my DVD player, I re-examined the jackets cover, and even though I removed the cover from the plastic screen, I still couldn't read any of the production details about the movie. This movie has the title Evil on the Jacket and had to find it by going to Faith Film's website to find out that there is some connection to it here on IMDb. The movie and the special effects that were made in the movie looked pretty good ... You spoke a line reader actress. Oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like a pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt was made to go beyond reading the lines of the script. First I thought I got a bad disk out of audio synchronization, so had to persuade it was a foreign movie when I couldn't read the jacket ... English dialog called. If they had thrown the right person to translate the dialogue, this movie could be decent. I gave it a chance at approx. 20 minutes before the draft when I discovered that the bad line reader would not be turned off, but remained as the constant main luminaire. Yes, it's so bad! The jacket covers art and the art in the film is great, so gave one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rat dialogue. I do not recommend this one!
