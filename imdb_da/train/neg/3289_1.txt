I want to tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all fans would feel if they made a remake of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, taking out all the music and making it a drama. Do you think they would like to! This movie does not have the same feelings as the original. Sure, the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they were in trouble because they were always set up to get in trouble, and their main goal was to help people who passed through the city. None of that was true for the people who made this movie, they may never have seen the original show all the way through. My big question is, what will they destroy next?
