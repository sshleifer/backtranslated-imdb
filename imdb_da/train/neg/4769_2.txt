Unfortunately, it was misunderstood. This movie stunk from start to finish. It was hard to see because I used to see Clarissa explaining it all every day at Nickelodeon. I LOVED her. So the next thing I found she spread in Maxim and she was beautiful! I haven't really heard anything about her until I saw this movie by accident. I couldn't believe she would even leave something like this seen with her name over it. Everything about it was wrong, but it looked like someone somewhere in the team was really trying to save a submerged ship. Too bad .. I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie.
