This is the most elementary kind of traditional ghost story, not even increased to any degree by using Irish places. If the great Mr. James had ever had a story so thin - James doesn't have a story called "Thin Ghost"? - He wouldn't have bothered to have it published. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles appears in the limbs as an advantage for a band of old friends, the film's producers. His presence and the one film industry in-joke would have earned this will-o'-the-wisp's Oscar nomination. This is even more evidence if more is needed, the Academy Awards have never been a guarantee of profit.
