I was not familiar with American television stations when I pondered this on my in-laws cable, first I thought it was just a low-cost sci-fi movie, and after a few minutes I began to think it could be a smart satire on the worst profits of Christian fundamentalists, and then it started on me - good sadness, these people are serious! It's been a while since I saw something so unintentional fun. I hesitated to write a review of this for fear of violent believers, but then I saw other reviews and thought, hi, they can take it. Tough philosophical assault: How do you make a film that criticizes movies without actually showing what you're criticizing? Answer: Do it in such a way that the only people who will appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movie you criticize. I suppose some liberals (nasty! Saliva when you say it!) May be offended by the filmmakers' contempt for those in the audience who are not obsessed with the J **** C ***** myth, but I didn't do it was not so much fun!
