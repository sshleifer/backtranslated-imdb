Okay, just by reading the title you would think would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well, but became so boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> It tells a story of a mother so desperate that her daughter becomes a cheerleader that she wants to go for some length to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way. She always wins the competitions and therefore pushes the mother further to "eliminate" her. After talking to a "hitman", the mother determines that the girl needs to be incubated a little. So actions are taken, but she eventually gets caught. <br /> <br /> The casting is horrible and the film pulls too long for nothing to happen. Don't waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
