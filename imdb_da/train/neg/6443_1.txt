I was one of the few non-liberals who turned out to see Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... in propaganda film creation and boredom. I hoped the movie could be a real documentary from Michael Moore's visit to my local school, the UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to slam conservative and the local religious community. It seems to be self-service for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising is to see all the '10' voices his homeys submitted here. See even the video? Golly gives Batman, it must vote with all the president's men! Their reviews are as obvious as bias in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, like stacking the voices on IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my voice will help balance this.
