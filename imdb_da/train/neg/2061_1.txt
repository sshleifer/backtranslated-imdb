The only movie I've ever gone on. Great when I paid for myself and my date, and I'm really cheap. But my brain couldn't stand more of the kill that was stacked on, especially since I could have written more fun material while you were bunching and gagged. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this film insults. Worse, it's not fun. It wasn't fun then, and it's probably not fun now. But even worse is that this movie represents the beginning of the end of really smart, sophisticated comedy. It's juvenile, really sophomoric script and ideas began an era (which continues to this day) how cheaply laughs, and sexual induendo dominates comedy culture in movies. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? Which high school kid didn't think about it? The beginning of the end.
