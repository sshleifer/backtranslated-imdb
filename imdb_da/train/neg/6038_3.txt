I had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes and that was exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course it's campy, of course part of the dialogue wasn't perfect, of course "special effects" were a bit hokey. That's why I enjoyed so much in the movie. It's a perfect fit for this genre of a 70's Horror classic. The talent must start something where it goes to the actors and the crew, and what better piece of material to sharpen your abilities than this. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another movie from these producers and directors.
