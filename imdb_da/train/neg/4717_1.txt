And how it made it into production confuses me. The main character is an unpleasant show, who is not the least fun. I can't stand the character at all. He's a stupid ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst comic to the surface in the last 10 years, no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are just as bad as those at Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I didn't like this show any more, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse. It's as if this show is written by a couple of 15-year-olds who based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lacking in creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go away long and fast!
