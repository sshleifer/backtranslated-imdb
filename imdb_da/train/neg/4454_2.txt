First little background I am English and have lived in London all my life. I've been to many games at 'The Den' and most other London clubs. I am familiar with the type of person who comes into hooliganism, and I just know how they act and how they speak. Must say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie with embarrassment. I felt I was writing a mini-review because I felt I had to point out a few things. <br /> <br /> People do not speak like this in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole snake stuff too far and made it blatantly silly. Unfortunately, hooligan types exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately succeeded as English or Cockney as Osama Bin Laden. He's from the north north of Newcastle, and I'm just amazed at some of the other actors who could keep up with him - how to take him seriously. Why they just didn't get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done a bang up job myself, hehe. c) Mr frodo I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicks robbed of people, twice his size, and who is really ugly hooligans. He would be dead. Simple as that. Honestly (like a Brit) it was hard to see this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will bomb here in England. It can do a little better in the states because the Americans just don't know (or usually) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these companies exist, but they are all very underground and hush hush, and on a much smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually, they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and do not expect us to notice.
