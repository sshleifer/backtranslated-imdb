I had to sign up for IMDb just to comment on how horrible this movie is ... my cats and a ball of string have a better story than this. Not the worst play I've ever seen, but when you wipe almost the entire movie of the movie within 5 minutes, it's a bit to be desired. There was not a single 'scary' moment in the movie, except when they watched the movie 'Halloween' on the TV. Everywhere it seems that it could have been a good story, rolling the credits and that Chasey Lain was in it, was a bit of a loss when I didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could I have said 'oh yes, there she is'. I am so glad I saw this at a hotel and didn't pay for it as I would be really crossed if I had paid a cent to see this. I can usually or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even fun as well, it's bad .... it's simply bad.
