This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It is not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot description. This movie is agonizingly slow and I'm bored for almost every 98 minutes. While the play is, at best, mediocre, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and plodding without any direction. Occasionally, a creepy mood is only set to be broken by an unusable line or event. I'm not surprised that the whole cast was sick and shed between shots, they should try to digest a terrible script. As a big fan of good horror movies, I'm always annoyed that something bad is being done. Save yourself 98 minutes, you will never come back.
