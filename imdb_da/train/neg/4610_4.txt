I saw this movie because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the throw. I have long had a theory about her that she is a talented actress but never seems to prove it because she is always in this kind of low budget B movie. She is still beautiful and she is still trying to deal with the unfortunate material I always see her in. It is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it does not do well. George Wendt played against type and it was so cruel that he got recognition for his role. Another note about Mrs Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk significantly since I saw her last. Perhaps reduction surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. This is not a bad thing. She still looks good. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
