Imagine the worst sketches of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90 minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in the bad sketches is removed and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Got it? Okay, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie. The vision you've just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the only worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs ... very few. But it was lame. Although the purpose of the movie was to be paralyzed, it was too shameful to be fun. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry to waste my time seeing this was someone I know bought it. He wasted his money. Vince Offer has not written or directed anything else, and it is not surprising why.
