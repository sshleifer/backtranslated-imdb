... or more precisely, so bad that you want the time of your life laughing your ass out when you see it! James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker" from 1983 is certainly one of the most horrible productions the Sword & Sorcery subgenre has brought together, but it is very entertaining. The action is horrible, the plot is purely crap, and the effects and photography could not be more amateurish. But that's the bad play, the cheesy effects and the many mistakes that make this movie so much fun. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely powerful and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch performs him to unite the chaos and the three forces of creation, a sword, an amulet, and a caliber to free the land from its brutal ruler, the evil king, and the magician monks. Obtaining the sword is quite easy, but the amulet and limestone are in Munker's possession. Fortunately, the evil king has arranged a tournament where the county's most talented warriors are fighting each other to death. The winner is then to take the king's place. Of course, the King does not want anyone to take his place, and therefore he has planned to kill the winner (instead of just arranging the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker is not only attaining the three powers of creation, but also saving the old good wife's beautiful daughter (Barbi Benton) from the evil monks claws. Fortunately, he is not bored on his way to the tournament when he is now allowed to breathe the beautiful female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) ... <br /> <br /> The movie has many great, amazing stupid and fun scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker has a bad guy with his sword. However, the falling head is not the guy's head. The falling head has a red goatee, while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and not beard. <br /> <br /> - When the woman's warrior Kaira's character (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is first seen in a black cloak, hiding her face and body. Deathstalkers traveler's companion Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights her, and under her sword, her cloak (under which she is of course topless) is fighting and spreading her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see from Lana Clarkson just before her face. - The last warrior Deathstalker must fight in the tournament, is a huge guy with a man and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> - Evil Monks have a nasty little creature locked in a chest. He gives birth to the little creature human eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> There are many other unintentional fun, fun and great scenes. The action is horrible, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eye-candy, and although I described this movie as "accidental fun," I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were quite aware of the crazy movie. There are a lot of things to do and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor want the time of their lives!
