Under average movie with bad music is considering a movie based on music ??? Ordinary Script & Direction full of blunders. Salman Khan was at his usual acting. Ajay's performance deteriorated over time as his appearance, especially his styles as a Rock Star was pathetic. Asin was only a showpiece. Overall, I felt like wasting my money in the cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie, all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The main song to impress the British music sponsor was most unimpressive. "Khanabadosh" can easily be understood by an English music sponsor. The second movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid" which was a simple slow love story with good direction and action despite average music
