Apparently, most viewers know nothing about Europe's history, including Germany, Hungary and all of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Hitler and Stalin times. Nuremberg (and many forgotten trials throughout Europe) was a vengeance and injustice for the winners. What do you think was why, after World War II, were no US, British, French, or Soviet prosecutors? There were no US, British, etc. War crimes? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg, justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (It was also a book title in America, 1941). And first and foremost: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why wasn't the Nuremberg process enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin gets envious of it ...
