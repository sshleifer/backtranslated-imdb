Now I want to be the first to admit it when I say something that can be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting on how much I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> It also summarizes it. I didn't like this movie. To be more specific, I didn't like the concept of this movie. The kinematics were good. The atmosphere was weird. And the play was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> But history is fierce, unacceptable and misleading. It's also offensive. I am a quarter Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel offended at a personal level of the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all he is a black guy. And it's not a racist remark I swear. The idea of ​​a white, Latin American, or even Indian, swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that katana represents. Katana represents the soul of a samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors, who govern and protect the Samurai. For Ghost Dog to use his weapons instead of Katana is also an insult to the magazine and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway? It must be one of those replicas that offends the Samurai caste even more. <br /> <br /> Also Ghost Dog showed no honor. At the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then kills a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain. Not only is this a cowards way of killing an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent assassin; a group that samurais denies exists but hates no less. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is a baddie. Do you know what a true samurai does when he teaches his master, is it proven to be evil or dishonest? He kills himself to prove that he would rather die and lower himself to the level of his doggish master. <br /> <br /> Everything about the character was a huge contradiction to the real code that the whole samurai sticks to: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So, we have great filmography, good mood and so-so-acting that include a satirical plot and performance (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it), making it an unsatisfactory overall movie and an insult to everything a glorious bushi (samurai) loved ones. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
