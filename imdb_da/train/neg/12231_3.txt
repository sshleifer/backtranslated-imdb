I watched this movie, and at times I was not convinced to believe this movie "saw me". Munchie sullies 'farce' in the years to come. Look again at Star Wars, Don't-watch Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I'm talking to those who are parents now), I (you) wouldn't let my child ever participate in this pseudo-occult video festival. Insinuating Munchie is satanic, for a fellow player, is probably illegal a chilled 'duh'. He is hostile, alien, rodential and utterly vicious - just as the Bogey man made meat, invisible to adult, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without income made possible by many years of self-denial and prudent management). He is a peddler of light answers and false ideals. He is all that the morally conscious seer is not. He's the devil's own Ron Popeil. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean this literally and figuratively, with emphasis on the past) that this movie hasn't made the format for DVD. It is my hope that this type of "yellow film production" died an untouched death in the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention it. It comes up a lot.
