This must be one of the films where the trailer is 50 times better than the film itself. I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked good. Then I always wanted to see it, but could never find it ... ... until today, yes 14 years later. Let's just say I was so disappointed that it was unreal, OK, I knew it wouldn't be an Oscar winner, but still hoped it would be fun no brain movie in the blood sport. Unfortunately it wasn't, it's Pooh, what about all the American rock and roll music and the play was so bad it was pretty scary. The fighting scenes were bad and looks fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD only costs me £ 5 and I think I was overcharged by £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sorry I know I never get that hour and a half back.
