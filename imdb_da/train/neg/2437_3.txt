Now I start to admit that I'm not a John Ford fan. (I saw "The Informer" only because I am trying to work through a list of "greats".) So, if you are, just move together because you will not agree with me. <Br /> <br /> Which overwhelmed and dated piece of silveriness is it! I would say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few movies are about the Irish Revolution), but as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under overblown and inexpensive mood . I suppose it is a bit interesting to watch for a while to see the less-than-seamless transition made from the silents to "talkies" - some of the school's actors have endowed the premature quality to early movies and films can play better with title cards than the speech dialog. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from restoring all feelings six times.) What dialogue is usually, "They are always after me lucky charms!" quality aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are useful to remind us that we are in Ireland because the sets look pretty much like they were pulled in from some German expressionist pieces filmed on the next soundstage. (It feels as if you with an eagle eye can see some villagers out to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) Techniques change. Tastes change. So I don't want to say how crazy it seems that this movie was so recognized in its time. But it is not one of the classics who quit --- more just "fair warning" of the kind of simplified malarkey that Ford should spend his career.
