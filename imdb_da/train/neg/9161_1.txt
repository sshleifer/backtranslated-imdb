... you can pop this into the DVD, play one and a half and half of your life, you never come back and find out. <br /> <br /> Shop? What is shopping? <br /> <br /> Production Values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Don't let me get started. After many years of posting on IMDb I never thought I'd see a movie so bad that I really wanted a lower rating than one. I have always found at least some reason to see profit - if only the intention or effort of the author, director, cast or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, they're "all the same guy (!) who really needs to get hold of that fact, at least as evidenced by this worthless video tape waste that he have no talent. I think it would be a reasonable excuse if it was a junior high school's "production" for his first cinema class, but the referenced "artist" behind this boy was twenty-six at the time of this abortion. <br /> <br /> How was it ever done? Who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this? Also, don't let the box cover fool you: there is not even something like a good sex scene or any good "exposure" of hunk on that cover. <br /> <br /> Two final things: there was a second when this "movie" had redeemed value: the above-mentioned "talent" is rounded off by its lover. I cheered! And I learned one thing from this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it is actually really fun. But not in any comical way; It's just unfortunately humorous. Very sadly humorous.
