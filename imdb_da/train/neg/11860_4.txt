If you haven't figured out what will happen in this movie for the first five minutes, give it a few minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to jump out. She has a teenage daughter who only emphasizes that she doesn't get any younger. While looking at her daughter, she discovers a world she has never dared ... the cabaret where she can belly dance in foamed sequined outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamistic. It's portrayal of men's gloomy. It's quite odd that Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them, not for money, but just for hell of it. When she succeeds in awakening them, it makes her feel like a woman again. She does not want to connect with them, but she is dependent on attention. The other dancers are mostly aging women who look like men in a row and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived. Not enough, I say. She finds romance, but short, with you guessed it .... No surprises here we didn't see. Although the end is good, you realize that it could be completed without any other means. Maybe this movie is not targeted at my demographic-30 man
