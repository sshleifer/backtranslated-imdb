A scientist on an island is deeply saddened by the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: Why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. Well, who wouldn't? It is a little difficult to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul". Also William Forsyth's throw as a MacGyver kick-ass-savetheday-kinda completely lacks credibility. On the other hand, there are a few chickens that make you look on the screen while shark Paul bites someone else to death. In fact, I find bad b-movies totally entertaining. But for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made to say 1 million bucks less. So it could have been fun.
