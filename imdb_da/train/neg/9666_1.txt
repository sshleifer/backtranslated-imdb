Having seen "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this movie is horrible, even measured against the low "standards" of history. It is of course completely finished and harmful. This is what one would expect from the 1930s German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap. It is also so blatantly ridiculous that even modern Germans must have left the theater with their nose. In a genre known for its basic appeal, lack of originality and unapologetic inaccuracy, this film does not even qualify as "bad". It would be necessary to improve significantly to reach that status!
