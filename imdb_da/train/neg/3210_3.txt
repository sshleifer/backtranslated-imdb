There really is no way to turn around the bush by saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture is simply bad. Apart from the fact that the protagonist is a well-developed blonde running around in hell in a leather bikini with occasional splashes of graphic violence, the movie appears to have been made with the mentality of an 1980s cartoon based on a series of action numbers. The bad guy even speaks for himself as a Skeletor wannabe, has the mandatory inappropriate henchman, and lives in a lair that appears to be the pattern of the villains' domain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any other humor than the sometimes haunting bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime story that is better suited to hentai, but there is no sex, no tentacle rape (thank goodness!) And very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. Essentially what we have here is an episode of She-Ra, Power of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more.
