This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify Mary Ann Letourneau's actions. To do this they threw a 19 year old well, probably not "to do this." There was no way they could have thrown a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have broken everyone out (if they had been allowed to do so) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, which made her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophiles does not need to contain many children - all you need is one. I really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility for her students that she didn't live up to. The reason is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medicine. It is understandable that she did not think rationally. One hopes that she now understands her actions. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I ask that she be on her medication and think clearly. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Penelope Ann Miller was completely convincing and perfect for throwing the role.
