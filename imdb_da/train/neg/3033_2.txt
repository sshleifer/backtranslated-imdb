I'm a very big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At that time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong, and he was director of this movie, and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could of her by making this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they no longer make big budget porn movies. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but it is the real world and they cannot act. That's why there are pornstars, if a woman as beautiful as Jenna could trade, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn. Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords when she was a teenager through her 20s, she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth. She made her the low-budget mainstream movie and couldn't act. Where is she now? I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then "Dream Quest". Come on, Jenna, we won't hear you talking as much as we want to see you having sex. Also, you Jenna, would have much more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on film.
