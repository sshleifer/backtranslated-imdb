Considering its popularity, I found this movie a huge disappointment. Maybe I expected too much from this movie. After all, it is one of the most well-known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talked-about movie with occasional action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story doesn't give a sign that I could fight for as the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style and he cannot hide the clear imperfections found in the story. I know this should not be high art, but I found the movie boring. Absolutely not the best example of this very beloved genre. Its cult status escapes me. I advise you to skip it.
