Down to earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and he gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does a few things in Charles's body. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done better than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really fun-incredibly fun. You will laugh yourself and you can giggle, but you will certainly not roll on the floor laughing.
