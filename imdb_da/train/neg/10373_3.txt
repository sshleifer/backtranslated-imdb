This is one of the movies I could only review once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, it was 1933, but it really did. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there are faces about a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just clumped together without context. Much of Lewis Carrol's spirit, humor and continuity are lacking. What a shame! It's such a great book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.
