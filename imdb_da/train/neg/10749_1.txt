This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately happen to me: 1. The forest was more like hills in Los Angeles with a few trees and brushes. Not scary at all. News flash, if you are filming in southern California area, big bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Scripture was definitely the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal, clich√© or just stupid. For example, the camp's name is "camp blood" (lama), the name of the clown is "killer clown" (lame). What makes a clown in a forest anyway? Was it the only mask they could find? 3. The last but definitely the least was the actor. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever gathered. A virtual eclipse of shitty lines and bad plays. The worst part was long when then randomly flashed back to this fat foreign girl to become naked for a photograph. It's a really long scene, and I think she should be sexy, but she wasn't. Also, and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me, this tool was supposed to be "athletic". For example, when he is bored with the movie, he takes a few stones and begins to curl with them. Then he has to run for the clown and it is immediately clear to his very "girl as" runner that he is quite far from athletic. Oh and to the girl who played cat, good gentleman, stop singing. The song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> For some reason, watching this movie, I would at least recommend seeing the special features. The group of jackasses that made this movie talk about it as if it were this truly original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says she lets some of the friends read the manuscript, and none of them can predict the end. Apparently she hangs out with special children.
