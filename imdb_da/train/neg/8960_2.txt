The only thing that often comes into my head while writing this review is, I never get that one and a half hour back !!! to indicate that I am not just blowing air, I compare the movie with the other films in the cube trilogy (cube and hypercube)! The cube wasn't amazing, but it was original and it made up for some technical flaws! hypercube as a successor lost the benefit of originality, but it came out looking pretty sharp and I even liked it better than cube (the story was better)! But cube zero compared to it's predecessors is really not worth it! A complete lack of good eg, a very f * ck * d up script and just plain bad bad play, does not combine well! example: all the time during the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... should happen, and then it would happen so it's not that much original either! my advice: don't lose that hour and a half i lost !!!!!!!! Oh, and I hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
