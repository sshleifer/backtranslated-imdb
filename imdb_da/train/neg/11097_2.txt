This is just the kind of Saturday matinee series I loved during World War II. I was under 10 years old. And it's the audience, this serial number is designed for. When you look at it now, you have to roar at its unpretentiousness and stupidity. The budget must have been almost nothing, given shortcuts and repetitions. The play? Now it is the republic's pictures, 1944. They read the lines .... and no doubt they had been taken to get them convincing. <br/> <br /> One and a half stars.
