I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie might be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... all!" the trailer said. Well ... it offended me because this movie really sucks. It's hardly a comedy when I laughed about two seconds in the whole movie. And what about all gays in this movie? I'm not gay, and I have no problem with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay people into a so-called comedy movie when those scenes aren't quite fun? I think the director is a gay man in denial or such. <br /> <br /> So my advice to you is: If you want to waste good money, rent a good comedy, you've already seen a million times you will be better than seeing this mother of all miserable comedies . It's really total crap.
