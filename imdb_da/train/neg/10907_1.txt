I expected a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. But this dud seemed to last forever. It is one of the flicks that enjoys the sad location of PG-13 while not suitable for children. The jokes are not just eyebrows or jokes, they are red, scary, and many actions cross borders to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to be crooked to get PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could have made a bigger splash like an R-rated movie if the fun was back. (Overstatement? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and ready to give almost anything a shot. In 45 minutes, the film felt it was going to wind down ... and boy were we ready for it. The exit is quaint, but does not save the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a freebie ... would have been sick to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe)
