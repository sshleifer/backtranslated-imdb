First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is like my summary. The biggest Sack of Crap ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who gets stage war on a comedy building called Apollo. On his way home from a concert while riding his bike, he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck. A little later, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up as the music group Outkast while trying to play the scene from the original where he comes out as a jockey. Secondly, he goes back to Apollo and tries to be a comedian, he tried to be in his former body and begins to reject the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my operation? This movie is horrible, it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out like a sack Just take my advice, don't even see this movie.
