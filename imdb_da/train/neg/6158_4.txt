Once in the mid-1990s, I used to write to the DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole fandom kept his breathing about the new American-produced doctor WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the doctor's bowman, the champion was to be played by Eric Roberts, scratched all their heads and exclaimed "Who is Eric Roberts?". I should point out that this was before IMDB came online as all you had to do was write a name on this site for their CV, but a helpful soul wrote to a publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role in which he stared opposite F Murray Abraham, the film is called AF SVEREN and was about a hedge school. In fact, looking back now Roberts is best known for the POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN, but it didn't stop the person who put the boot in both Roberts and BY THE SWORD, and his mind was set up by this American champion with his southern features were going to a debacle. Strangely, most fans were furious about Roberts, who played the champion, but after seeing DOCTOR WHO TVM as many fans (Even among them), Robert's performance believed the best of the disappointing US production. Yes, I'm digressing but the sword was a movie that I would see simply because it was the first time I'd heard the name of Eric Roberts, but I didn't get the chance to watch it this weekend and I was pretty disappointed with it. I know nothing about fences (Everyone else on this page seems to be obliged to mention, whether they fence or not. I am not called), so I do not know how exactly it is, but as mentioned, the film feels somewhat anachronistic, even if you saw it on its release in 1991, the hairstyles seem a couple of years outdated along with its mixed teenage cast make a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it would not have worked much better if it had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in mid-1980s. You might argue that this would have meant that the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard was at the center of most of the movie, but I was not convinced of their love / hate affair, and Abraham and Roberts gave much better ideas before and side of the sword
