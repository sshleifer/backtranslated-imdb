Basically, a dentist man-wife team and their 3 daughters act with adultery. The prerequisite is interesting, the play is good, and the music, although sometimes sudden and without direction, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is plotted. The man's dentist drops his wife from backstage on an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then goes in to give her something but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his anxiety about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear of confronting his wife for not having to "do anything about it "I don't want to tell you the end, but let me say that the movie goes nowhere and the end is like a sputtering ornament. Characters' motivation is missing: Why is she cheating on him? He is a dentist, decent looking, good father. The movie doesn't say. Who is she doing with it? Don't expect any answers to that either. Why does he want to keep the marriage in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose does all the children earn from vomiting? Where does this movie go? Good performances from Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are completely wasted by this stylish nonsense, which does not know whether it will be American beauty or a family movie. A root canal is more interesting. Avoid it.
