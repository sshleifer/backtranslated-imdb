This is a really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just writing this, so some people somewhere go off to see it. If I have stopped a person from wasting some of their precious life watching this movie, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Unutterably boring, though, since it was Al Pacino, I was fooled into thinking it was something interesting at all times. So the credits rolled, and I realized I had been totally fooled into seeing this incredible drive. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie has achieved as high a score as it has on IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the mood). Do you agree with people ironically? <br /> <br /> Please do not see this movie!
