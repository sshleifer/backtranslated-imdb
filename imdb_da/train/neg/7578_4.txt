Nothing less than a movie length version of the 1970s TV hit "Love, American Style", adorned with the glitter of the sights, "Superchick" (1973) is a soft piece of fluff that somehow manages to entertain. And the protagonist here, Tara B. True, is really a kind of superchick. A flight attendant (not a flight attendant) who is so beautiful that even her plane autopilot has made a pass on her (!), And with a hunky girlfriend in each port, this wingin puts 'swingin' crazy "lay" in "layover". What about her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star in L.A., Tara certainly keeps busy. And when she does not drain these guys from all their human energies as the viewer learns, she is responsible for taking karate class, high-club clubs, averting flashers and rapes, joining groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her plane. As I said, fun and safe started off well for an evening when you feel some brain-dead and just want to grill out in front of the tube. Future Astrologer Joyce Jillson brings a bit of beautiful charm to her role as Tara, and the movie looks great to please. Despite being disappointing, the Buxom '70s favor Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still have to do what they do best - show their chest! Although the picture is never laff-out-very fun and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it manages to be consistently entertaining and I suppose it's something. Strange that the final credits must pay attention to Mrs Jillson's body double; don't think I've ever seen it before!
