Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. Movies that previously attempted to redeem on the holiday spirit, especially 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians', were at least entertaining to see because of the camp for it, and the entire stockpile was used ... for some reason that seemed happy me. But this movie only screws Christmas in the butt and screws the joy of all the kids. Santa Claus lives in the room? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa Claus gets help from Merlin Wizard? How random is this? Well, when it was made in Mexico, some of you can understand the way in which the film was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were just crazy at the time. It was an all-out cluster of madness! Although, despite all the problems with the film, it feels like a Christmas movie. God conquers evil, and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts of any good girl or boy in the world, or possibly. Universe, thanks to Santa Claus, overcomes the Martians .. apparently. So I think you should try it, even if it is one of the worst holiday movies all the time ... even if it should put a smile on your face every day.
