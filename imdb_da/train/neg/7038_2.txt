Oh yes the 1980s, a time with Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and a lot of other actions hiding in a distant jungle blowing away dressers. At that time I couldn't believe how movies like RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Make money at the box office, they are turgid action crap fests with a right off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly. TROMA'S WAR is a tongue in the cheek, take on this type of movie, but you have to ask yourself, did they need forgery in the first place? Of course not . TROMA'S WAR lacks any kind of sophistication - although it does point out that there is no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing - and sometimes feels more like a class z film than a send-up. Maybe it is?
