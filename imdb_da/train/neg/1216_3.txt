The genre of excitement really takes a dive in this. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you have to create difficult situations that will cause excitement and the tense feeling of what happens next, but this movie was so predictable and just unbelievable. I find that the more I see this kind of movie, the more I constantly tell things to actors to guide them away from danger. Persistent bad decisions just border on being stupidly stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I could have had it a little. That said, you may be better off staying away from it.
