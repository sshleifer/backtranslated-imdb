I saw this movie for the purpose of not liking it. I did not do it. It is one of the films apparently made exclusively for the Oscar: music in the whole movie in almost every frame, almost no profanity, set for a long time away, sepia-toned imagery, pretentious title, NO SEX and a genius explaining everything he believes and concludes in sfx / cgi, so we (the stupid audience) get it. One thing that amused me is the fact that they spelled NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead, they call the Nobel Prize (named after an actual person called Alfred Nobel) 'the noble prize'. Jesus! How can one make such a mistake in such a large production, supposedly based on a true story. What a shame! What were you and the others thinking about RON?
