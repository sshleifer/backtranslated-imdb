I rented this on DVD yesterday and was not aware that it was a type of "character study" type of movie so I struggled to see in an hour before the hit button Stop. <br /> <br /> Even with a character study theme, I couldn't even get into this movie. Maybe it was my mood in wanting to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but I put it aside, I tried my best to continue looking but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination didn't come together to keep my interest. About the only interesting thing was that the sergeant's gun was stolen, and he rushed to buy another, and the spray painted it black to appear as a police issue. I think this movie should have been justified, "Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?" Scenes were well done, but putting them together I again felt robbed of something coherent to keep me looking. When I hadn't finished watching it, I'd say there is some profit to renting this movie. .. maybe. For me, it was a waste of good viewing efforts and time. I will leave it to you to try it, but it is not one I would highly recommend.
