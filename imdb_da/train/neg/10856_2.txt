Now, I don't want to lie to you, but I've only got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth, leading singer of the still popular death band "Cradle Of Filth" in it. Of course, I expected violence and doing its utmost, as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as between a plot. <br /> <br /> But dear god, I was oh so wrong. This movie bites seriously, great time. Being a low budget movie (haha, wait, make it ZERO BUDGET), this of course lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestral musical scores and Spielberg's special effects. No, it's all a camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. For example, when our star and violent enemy, Mr Filth, kills a pitcher. A grab in the throat, and blood spits out, but oh my, it seems that there is a juice pack filled with false blood in the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> For you Cradle Of Filth fans: You hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera's angles and scary movie recording, they draw the general pleasure of the song DOWN. My last comment: Well away from it. It's blood, gore, breasts and hi, even a creepy story to go with it. So if you like scary violence, almost no voices (yes, there is hardly any word in this movie) then you have to buy it. But if shoddy movies are not your thing, avoid it. Don't waste your money.
