The only thing good about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I didn't expect Citizen Kane, I was waiting for Independence Day, a movie that is pure popcorn fun, but instead I got the horrible Roy Liotta movie called "Turbulence" Yes, it's so bad SOAP. The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the title's title for the movie, it wasn't even a glimpse of "snake" or "fly" 40 minutes in the movie! What a false advertisement! If it wasn't for its title, SOAP would just be another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie. And R rating? It must be the most undeserved R-rated movie of all time! Movie makers' decision makers only add a few words to make this an R, Al violence kept pg-13 level. Do you know what is really rated R? The R-rated superstar Edge! Watch him at Summerslam instead of wasting your money on a snake!
