This mini-series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, that is, building a long history after the family's life for many years. While in 'Queen' the result was masterful, the lack of inspiration was lacking in Mama Flora. Firstly, perhaps in the book itself and certainly in this television production. Too much is too much over the years, so that the unfolded saga is low, superficial, not as authentic as in 'queen'. Full characteristics of the scene in the earlier parts of the film, which were prepared with great care, but as the film's progress seemed to emerge into a kind of dallasian-forsythian unpleasant mix in the last third of its three hours duration. I was hoping for more; but apparently Haley was less inspired by this narrative than his almost biographical "Queen", and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman. Only advisable to those who have an appetite for these long stories of generations growing up.
