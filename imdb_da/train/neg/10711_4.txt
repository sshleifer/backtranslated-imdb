Minion is about ... Well, a minion. A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. He is a kind of demon who possesses people and when the body dies, wants another. Anyone who happens to possess will go on some bersker rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of Templars, whose task is to keep the key away from the minion. The movie begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where a couple of knight temples fly from the minion. Then flash until 1999, when the key is won somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist has the task of studying / digging the place where the key was found. Needless to say, minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long-running hunting scene between minion and Luke and archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The movie is just that, a low budget B movie flick. The film lacks energy, and just in spite of it. You follow chase, but you will never feel involved in the story, intentionally taking ideas from previous movies (especially The Terminator movies). The battle scenes with the minion are cumbersome because you never get the feel of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is. The "skillful" becomes a one-man army when fighting for a temple group, but sucks when it comes to one-on-one. And it must be for a long time. All this shows that any sense of logic is only thrown into the drain for convenience. The whole idea of ​​a secret order of the Templars, a door to hell, and the key is not well explained. We are just accepting that they just exist. The film seems to be made with the feeling that there is not much potential for the story, but only enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren certainly looks like he wants him to be somewhere else. Rating: 2 out of 5 stars.
