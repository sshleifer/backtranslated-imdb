Despite pretty bad reviews, I just had to give this movie a go ?? after all, it makes star HK superbabe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. It's probably worth checking out? Well as the babe-fests go, the Martial Angels are hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks so amazing as always, and the rest of the girls caught Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang especially my rowing eye. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if you have to judge this movie with other possible benefits, it is an absolute stink! The story is weak, the action shoddy and special effects even pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing have given us a kerosene cast and a little bit more. If Shu Qi is the only reason you are considering seeing this, you would rather see Sex and Zen 2 again!
