The film appeals to the public because of Karisma of Ben Stiller and the notoriety of J. Aniston. It seems that here we have a recipe for a successful title, but nothing has succeeded in this movie. Polly is very well played by Aniston without a doubt. This is the kind of character that suits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same cumbersome guy as in "Meet the Parents", but in this movie, the comics are compared to the title mentioned above. Scripture is very poor with nothing special at all. With these two well-paid actors things could get much better - but what can they do when there is such a bad story and script. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
