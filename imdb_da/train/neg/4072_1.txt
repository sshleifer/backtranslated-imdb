I see bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent throughout. <br /> <br /> I'm LAZY. <br /> <br /> Normally, I see a bad movie and curse. This was so bad I made a review to try to save others from the very boring mess I was sacrificed for. <br /> <br /> I'm smashing my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> Using a clean room is too easy. So boring. See 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has some entertainment benefits. This slam looks awful, is terrible, and who made it must feel terrible.
