Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star vehicle that would cross its appeal to white and ordinary black audiences, updates the hit combination "Heaven Can Wait" with an urban agenda. He plays a fighting comedian involved in a car accident that has his soul removed too early from his body - therefore his angels have to find another body to place him in and can only come up with that of a white businessman. Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" shows only that Rock's Eye was at the cashier's office (this was strictly a business movement organized by Hollywood's most mercenary). Why not strive for something higher or more memorable than a stupid reincarnation comedy that culminates in an evening at Apollo? Outstanding eligible (including the normally reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and amazing Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems awkward and insecure by itself all the way. * 1/2 from ****
