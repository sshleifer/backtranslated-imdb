There is no doubt that this movie has an impressive cast, but unfortunately it does not help with the major drawbacks to the movie. I never understand why instructors ask actors / actresses to use accents not their own when it's obvious to everyone they can't convince. Fiennes just can't do Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the acting character will never be convincing. As for the big problem .... the plot .... was there one? I suppose there was some kind of story involved, but it was so full of holes that I just couldn't wait for the movie to end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and not watch this movie!
