The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She doesn't even appear until two-thirds of the movie is over, and then it's in a smaller role. I also do not consider it a supportive role, but rather a "bit" part. The plot also has many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: why does the protagonist reject his eldest son? Why does her youngest son drive into the train? He says it for a "sucker" bet that doesn't explain anything. Of course, one does not know the definition of a sucker effort. This movie is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think it should be seen.
