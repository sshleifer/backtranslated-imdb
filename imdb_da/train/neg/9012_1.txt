Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my boyfriend told me it was the worst movie she's ever seen ... When I thought it was pretty terrible, it made me think - which movie was the worst movie I ever had seen, and that was the only movie that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was a couple of years since I saw it, but I remember the awful mistress Dean Cain as a cocky military man (beautiful boy, Cain doesn't do very well). The strange deal with the CGI helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to hire a chopper than to hire some CGI guys to do so, but my guess is that they found chopper as a free sample for some CGI programs or manufacturers son liked to play with his new computer. And what did it look like? Terrible. And when the dragon runs through the complex's corridors, the same shots are reused again and again - look very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really awful ...
