This may be the worst movie adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring fake. However, I would say that it is almost bad enough to be fun. The hairstyles are remarkably dated. I can't understand for my life what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where "A Chorus Line" plays. Do we have to believe that these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line" that contains the stories of the people who are auditioning? Oh no, the show is collapsing on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and have listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do this?
