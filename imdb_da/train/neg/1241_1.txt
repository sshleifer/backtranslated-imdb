This is the worst movie I've seen for years! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. I thnik when something happens in this movie ,,,, and the play is worse. The end lifts it a little and saves the movie from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this sucks.
