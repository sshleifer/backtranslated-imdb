I was obliged to watch the movie for my work so I didn't pay for it (on the contrary, I was paid), but I still found the movie to suck far more than average. The jokes were lame, the two leading actresses ... yes, to use the "First Wives Club" section of women in Hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" age but more in their "district lawyer" "age. What saddened me most about the movie was the most important plot line that basically completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(where the boys are all jazzed up by some guy offering them money to "make his wife" and Don't realize they are expected to murder her). All in all, a boring piece of crap.
