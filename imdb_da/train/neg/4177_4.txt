Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, This movie was pretty average. It's a bit boring in some parts, but there are some good gore effects, but they're not good though. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have largely taken over the world. V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, who also has their own spaceship and is led by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from a land and team formed by Quintana (played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman are played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.) The V-SAN later meets with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside of Total Recall. He has no plans to live peacefully with people as he is bowed to world domination. <br /> <br /> While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I will be back in the DVD player soon.
