Film School's intellect can throw everything they want about the important (imagined) meaning of this movie, but it's just that: intellectual stuff. This film is creative bankruptcy, and some error is the infinite self-releasing wanking as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Of course, Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad because it could have been good. He captures the birth of this timeless song and instead chooses to cover the music with a guy reading out of a True Detective power or such a crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless images of what resembles 60's librarians spray paint words on people's cars. And then there is the seemingly endless "interview" in which the actor was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual issues. There is some guy in a purple dress reading more crap from a book that continues, oh, only about 20 minutes. And black pawns or something in a foam. <br /> <br /> That sounds almost exciting? But it is not. <br /> <br /> But for the unwashed movie school's hipsters who don't care about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones, bringing sympathy to the devil into the world and would rather hear some English guy reading instead while you staring at the cover of nudie mag's, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard can just blow.
