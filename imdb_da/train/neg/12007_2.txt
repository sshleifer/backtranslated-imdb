It's great to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the release day itself. I mean ..... look at the cast here, the promotion is fantastic, good enough songs and the trailers are fine. This makes it a full house on the first day, but it is only when people go and watch the movie that they realize there is no way their money is refunded. House full the first day, the movie is out next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by 'Love Actually', is what they say, failed to handle it all well. They tried to insert big stars, but ended up not even able to bring even an average performance of anyone. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can't connect with any of them. It's a big disappointment for all those who like big stars or for that matter Nikhil Advani after his great success with 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
