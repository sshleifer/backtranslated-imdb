I have never heard of this movie before playing as part of a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years on the cast list seemed tasty to say the least with seven names - besides topbilled Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not far from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and possibly even better known as the daughter of Theater Set Designer Norman, Walter Brennan, who did not need any introduction, Frank Faylen, the sadistic male nurse in The Lost Weekend and the much nicer little town man in It is a wonderful life, Robert Preston still a decade away from Harold Hill in Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter, who make up the numbers. Alas, most of them wasted their time. I looked in vain for any 'signature scene' as it was Robert Wise at bullhorn. By this time he had made about half a dozen movies and still had to find a style. The story is our old friend's range war, and Mitchum must have thought it was hardly a cut of the Hopalong Cassidy otters where he had cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you don't count the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter for information on his father's plans to move his cattle. This is absolutely true, but how did Mitchum know? We have seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it. In balance not much to say about this.
