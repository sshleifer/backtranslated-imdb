Robin Williams gave a good performance in The Night Listener like the other cast members. However, the film seems premature and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a "must see". I think the problem occurs because there is not a strong enough relationship established between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to spell it that way because IMDb will automatically correct the correct spell to "No") characters. The movie runs a little over 1:30 and within the first 15 minutes, or it seems, Noon begins his search for Pete Logande, the boy's caller. <br /> <br /> This happens after talking to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversation is not too profound, mainly consisting of how do you do it ... I am in the hospital ... why did your girlfriend move out, etc. In the book, the baby almost becomes Noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he is looking for this boy when he has found out that the child is disappearing and thinks he may be a hoax. <br /> <br /> In the film, Noon is obsessed with finding Leaping, but the audience is left wondering why? Since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between dinner and the caller, why bother? Who cares about the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but these calls and the relationship were crucial to getting on the screen because it forms the basis of the rest of the movie. As this does not happen, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City. When it was made for a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
