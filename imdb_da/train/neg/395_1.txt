When I ordered this from the Blockbuster website I had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I had forgotten to take my ADD along on that day. I know that from the moment the cast went up in their station wagon, in their lower 70s style wide collars, bell-bottoms and feather hair, I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was honored to the dumpster. <br /> <br /> The first prediction of how bad things were to be was the story at the beginning and tried to explain which cosmic forces were at stake to pose chaos on the universe, forcing polyester and porn quality music on It would be the viewer. From the opening scene with the poorly executed effects to the "monsters" from another world and then the house, which jumps from universe to universe, is as painful as seeing a primary school production of 'The Vagina Monologues'. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, there were certain signs that were happening when a small ship appeared. The "ship" suspiciously included what looked like old VCRs and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path. Of course, if it moved slower than Bob Barker's impacted bowel, but it had threatening pencil thin fittings and the ability to throw a grim green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through just balsa wood in an hour or two (with a little help). <br /> <br /> Moving on ... As weird and beltbands continue ... We found out they were caught in a "Space Time Warp". How do we discover this little nugget scientific information? Because the oldest male leader tells his son that he is more or less reminiscent of the cuff, how to win the big game over a cup of Joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was Pops a Scientist? No, but he knew about horses and has apparently mixed up as an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theories. <br /> <br /> The recording I saw on DVD was almost bootleg quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot by a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, except that it was really really bad. (There isn't enough 'really' to describe it, really). I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. I have never seen this movie on its original release, but even then I think I would come to the same conclusion: bury it quickly.
