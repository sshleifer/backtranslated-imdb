As a veteran of many many pretentious French films, I thought I had taken the worst that the industry had to offer and could do something. But not this. Spotless, relentless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
