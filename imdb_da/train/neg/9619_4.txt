If you can believe it, * another * group of teenagers returns to * another * lake hut three years after * another * one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of their number. Low and low, a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap papery one on it) turns out to spill them one by one. This mechanical "Friday 13th" button-off has got a little notoriety as one of the first digital-shot features, but this is where the interesting facts end and everything left is a predictable amateur production with sub-parameters and a recurring boom microphone intrusion. A last second twist does a little to lift the spirits, and 'Memorial Day' is something best cast in a lake and forgotten. One for only insane slasher collectors.
