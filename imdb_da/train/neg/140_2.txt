Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought about it: <br /> <br /> Works: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can't act. The other is not much better. History: The story was okay, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to be a good movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name `Paige Prescott 'Recognize Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Can't see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
