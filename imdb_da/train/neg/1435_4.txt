This movie was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and returned the world's eye again to what little of "Wild Western Canada" is left. When Archie began writing his stories to the papers; Today's thinking was to tame the desert and transform / absorb the first peoples. <br /> <br /> The movie sets forth and asks the question; Why would a well-educated, overtly talented Englishman become Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams of becoming something, but understanding the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no matter what it is. It sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw that Archie became my living image of "Cigar Store Indian" a very wooden character and not really at all - very well done by Mr Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and reality of it was not realized until he met and married his wife Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would lead him to lead the Englishman's world stage, not as himself, but Gray Owl a Canadian native of the desert border. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie to the noble wild prototype. <br /> <br /> Mr. Brosnan's interpretation and directors are both well-finished. I've seen documentaries on Gray Owl, and I think it's a great big screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie would meet the Grand Council of Chiefs was a great moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian lake landscape and real "Gray Owl" sites. <br /> <br />
