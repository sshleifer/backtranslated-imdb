It looks like someone can make a movie today. It's just like everything you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script and a little money, and you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and often these kinds of low-budget movies are duds. The video store shelves are filled with these so-called films. It is not even guilty of pleasure, they are just a waste of celluloid that is better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making garbage games, but most of their films are b film gold. But some of the movies they have posted, they had nothing to do with, and some, like 'Nightmare Weekend', didn't deserve any kind of release at all. <br /> <br /> Benefits: The cast members do the best they can with the miserable material. Some unintentional hilarity. Moves at a good pace (Must be 81 minutes). Cons: Terrible writing, which includes cold dialogue and countless plot holes. Poorly lit, especially night scenes and the end, which you can't handle at all. Don't make a feeling. Poorly scored cheap and very dated effects. Overall lack of character development and you don't care about anyone. This should be a horror movie, but it is lacking in that area and is not least scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding. Final Thoughts: I never expected to be a forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be so bad. I don't know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a particular competitor. Troma should have let this movie tear instead of giving it a release. Don't make the same mistake I made and let your curiosity get the best of you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
