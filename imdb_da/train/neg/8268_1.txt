This movie is horrible. Everything in it has been done before. There is nothing original. I can't stand when writers don't come up with their own reasons. <br /> <br /> A girl wants a wish for her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called Big. What's even more annoying is Jennifer Garner's play. She doesn't seem like she's 13 she just seems like she's stupid. <br /> <br /> From that point on, you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it just happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her. Wow, how amazing! But no .... her friend is bad and turns her on and tries to get her job done. But of course she eventually wins when she comes up with a "good" idea. <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the movie that I have seen a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
