I'm embarrassed to write this review. I say that because you read it will know that I was through it all and it is embarrassing to admit to strangers. But I had to warn those who read the viewer's comments on IMDb before seeing a movie, not seeing it. That's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The reason is the fog. The action is amateurish. And steering, camera work, sets, costumes, etc. are all second rate. Let it go.
