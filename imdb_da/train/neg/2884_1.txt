While working on a video store, I found it my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and colleagues about it. During one day with a particularly heated debate about what is the worst movie, my friend made a trip to see B.T.K. Killer, although I could see the whole movie and still claim that my previous choice was the worst movie ever, he would see it. I lost. I think even I did better videos than this at high school, and they were hardly big feats of a young genius. This movie not only lacked what appeared to be production value (it seems that it was shot on a bad video camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wood, hole and pathetic, do not scratch the surface) as well as just generally poor movie feeling. I remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly I was reminded of some bad high schools (I know I often refer to high school here, but this movie seemed very young) both in terms of the set, which seemed too fake but also as if the people read their lines from the manuscript, not quite sure what actually happened. My review doesn't do this movie justice because I can't describe how horrible the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
