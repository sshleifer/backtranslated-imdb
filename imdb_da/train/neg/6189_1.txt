I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she watched on television. But the version that was put on DVD was a disaster. The lighting was poor to nonexistent and the whole scenes were simply carved. In one case, Adele is put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in the middle of the sentence - where it is next night. Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even introduced, so you wonder if they had turned off for a few minutes during the movie. The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp. and even at $ 6.32 it was a gypsum. Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We'll send this back.
