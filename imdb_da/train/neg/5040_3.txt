I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps if the only Chinese films you have seen did not include any dialogue, long drawn-out distant waters and silent gazes, and hack editing, then you are on the spot. <br /> <br /> Complicated story line? Almost. Try young and amateurish. Exquisite moods and joking memories? Almost. Try flat and boring. <br /> <br /> This was terrible. I couldn't wait to be over. Especially when the best lines in the movie consist of "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes." Wow! What depth of character. I suppose the incessant cigarette smoking should speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed with this. Even Zhang's sentimental sappy "The Road Home" was better than this.
