I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = more fun! And more fun = better. If you are a bad movie fan I am, it is good material. However, if you seek any kind of meaningful plot, skill, or film-making skills, it is best avoided. The best part is how they quickly filmed all the fighting sequences in the trunk. Hilariously bad. Watch it for a laugh, watch it for thoughtless entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it for free on TV.
