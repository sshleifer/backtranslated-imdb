I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work and of the Covert-one books, and I had often thought how incredible they would be for a movie. Imagine my excitement of learning that such a movie actually existed! The "Hades Factor" was the first in the series, seemed an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the start, the movie was disappointing. Simple elements from the movie, like Griffin's first meeting with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and much less exciting. Several characters are also badly thrown. For starters, Dorff is unhappy as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice, as he is too soft and lacks the ability to exhibit many of the features that are final by John Smith. <br /> <br /> Names, redistribution and even omission For some characters, this film is further degraded. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the whole point of the movie somewhat blurred. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes varies greatly backwards (not to mention that the movie character does not share anything with the sign in the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel is probably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only should she be Sophie Amsden's sister (to be called Sophia Russel), but she must also work from the CIA, not "Covert-one". Which brings me to my last point and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE doesn't even exist at this time! Only to the second book in the series is the Covert-One conceived by the president as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could continue all day. In short - if you like the books and want to see a good fit, I'm afraid you will be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie, it is thoroughly average, mainly due to very lack of desire editing and bad effects. The bumbled story line and boring-like-itch-water script are the last nails in the very cheap coffin of this movie.
