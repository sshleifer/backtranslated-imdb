Also known in another form as "House of Exorcism", this rat <br /> <br /> little film takes itself as seriously as killing any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> at all. <br /> The spare pot involves European tourist Elke Sommer, who has a chance to run in with Telly Savalas, which looks like the devil she <br /> <br /> looked at a fresco in square. Summer gets a trip to a mysterious house in the country, where Savalas becomes <br /> <br /> butler. There she is wrong for a long dead woman and the real <br /> <br /> soap opera theater begins. The house's blind matriarch's spouse had an affair with the dead woman, who was the <br /> <br /> matriarch's fiancee. Couple giving summer trip? <br /> <br /> Now, the woman gives the driver, reverse drive <br /> <br /> lessons, "and the man knows and doesn't care. Finally <br /> <br /> most of the throw is killed, Summer is killed and raped, <br /> <br /> escaping and the viewer is taken to a climax aboard an empty <br /> airplane .. which must have resembled the empty theaters this thing played in. <br /> <br /> The alternative version of this "House of Exorcism" has scenes <</>> The VHS copy of this from Elite Entertainment is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> letterboxed There are "extra" after the final credit, deleted sex <br /> <br /> and making scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious, but his script is <br /> <br / > Terrible. There are half baked ideas, abandoned plotlines, and <br /> <br /> great conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing in a kind of forward-looking direction. br /> burials, the blind matri sheets don't seem so blind, <br /> <br /> and Savalas gets the same lollipops he had in "Kojak" (who <br /> <br /> mock you, baby?). <br /> <br /> The project looks like they had two name stars, so wrote <br /> <br /> the script quickly, something happening in Hollywood on a daily <br /> <br /> event now . Savalas looks completely lost, delivers his <br /> <br /> lines, and wants his character not dead in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dozen." Summer runs around and screams and shouts a lot, but <br /> <br /> her character is empty, I use loosely "characters" loosely. The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really strange movie and your response to it may depend on <br /> <br /> how heavy are you in Eurohorror and Kojak. I can't <br /> <br /> recommend "Lisa and the Devil." <br /> <br /> This is not classified and includes all additional features at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> do, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adults <br /> <br /> situations
