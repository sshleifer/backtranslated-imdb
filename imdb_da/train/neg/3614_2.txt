A schizophrenic has escaped from a NYC mental hospital, and soon the teachers begin to embark on St. Trinity University. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the root of red herring. Despite a 78-minute maturity, this cheap owl moves on and on to the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from coming, revealed as such. Director Richard Haines hardly breaks a sweat with any lame stalk-n-slash staging, but delivering the horror in the early 80s the audience probably expected. For all of our amateur anthropologists out there, this was filmed in New Yawk in the early 80's so you can check out the entire culture, beliefs and practices of living people from afar. The movie gets some credit to postpone "Final Girl". You rarely see it. Also always nice to watch a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Don't you think of priests, my beloved movie industry? Fortunately, this one is only a false priest and he is caught. However, he still works with the moral high angle.
