This movie is bad. If you are thinking of seeing it, there is only a decent scene in the movie and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school playing certainly has a better deal. The reason does not make any sense at all. The set was pretty lame and it wasn't even good to make fun of it. It was just boring and very very bad! I saw this at Starz, so I thought it should be least decent. The mini-description sounded like it would be okay. The girlfriend kills for apparently no reason at the start of the movie after you have to watch some horrible music videos. The transitions between scenes are very sudden, and it is as if someone is just putting lots of clips in a movie without thinking about how to transfer them. Cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness. Like my random switch from talking about how bad the movie is, to explain why the plot sucks. The sound goes low at some points where you can hardly hear it and gets so loud with homosexual "horror war" thrown into random points in the movie. It's the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Works: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame meter: 1,000,000 / 10
