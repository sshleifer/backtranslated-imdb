This kind of movie has become old hat now, doesn't it? It's all syrupy nostalgia that has turned itself into a kind of feedback loop. It certainly sounds like a good idea: A great ensemble cast, some good gags and some human drama about what could have / could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that ties them all together, just as it was in "The Big Chill", one of the usual films that created copycat films like this. You end up seeing more of one or two particular people instead of getting short on everyone. The superficiality this creates is not just annoying, it's crazy. The underlying script does not help.
