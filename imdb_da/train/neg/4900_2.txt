The SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten minutes more, ahem, extreme footage) here in the UK back in the early days of the video boom and caused a tabloid storm in a teapot when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder. Strangely enough, the brushes papers this ultra-disturbing flip under the carpet in their heads to get the relatively innocent as FROZEN SCREAM and NAT DEMON can, and the film has all been forgotten as a result. I jumped at the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie's duration with my jaw on the floor. It's not so much politically incorrect as completely denied, a triple-X takes on Michael Winner's DEATH (did the title sort to give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned?) With hardcore sex and some really horrible violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of the seventies sleaze. If you do not consider yourself to be squeamish, this may force you to think again. When the SEX WISH is over, you will want to scrub your eyes with disinfectant and take a warm hot shower to clean yourself. If any movie really deserves "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie" tag-line, this is it. Highlights (or lowlights) - an arbitrator using a vibrator on a victim he masturbates over her, Harry Reem's scene-stealing mustache, the helpless young black couple forced to screw in front of the sword's killer (they would have won Oscars For their believable beliefs, if the academy had become sour, before the Man is castrated for his troubles, some are in a sharp direction threatening to raise the matter of their obvious gate-house origin. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you thought the world was an innocent place 30 years ago, SEX WISH will show you a lot, very wrong.
