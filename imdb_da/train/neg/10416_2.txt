Before I saw this movie, I would have said that I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all-minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant or clich√©. Dito for Randy Quaid's stereotyping. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to wear this sodden mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy nature. It's the best I can give it. <br /> <br /> I'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky movies, but it's simply terrible.
