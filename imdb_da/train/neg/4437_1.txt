"The triumph of love" does not win over anything. It's a plodding, heavyweight, 4 hour torture. In fact, it is a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. It makes me afraid to think of the amateurish performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not quite as horrible. Maybe they tried to be so over the top, to be clownish, but in that case I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not give an impression in any way. She (he) is right there. My guess is that the game of the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. It couldn't be worse. Clare Peploe, the author and director of this film, was inspired by a new production of the piece. I don't know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the translation lost everything.
