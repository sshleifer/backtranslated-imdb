I just finished reading a book on Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. His robberies and excursions were well planned, down to the other - when the time was up, they left whether they had all the money or not. They had notes of each way they were going to turn etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis himself not SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, only pictures of him. The way his gang members died was fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank of his own, as he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, I might have had the movie. The action was a bit over the top in places. The action was also exaggerated. At second thoughts, I doubt if I would have had much, even though I hadn't read the book.
