The explosion of TV channels must be forever grateful for the Randolph Scott Western production line, for any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred Randolph Scott movies playing at least one budget position. <br /> <br /> "Man behind the gun" is a typical early 1950s melodrama with pre-WWII production values ​​based on a historically current murder mystery plot steeped in action scenes to hide the script. complete lack of character development and thus lack of tension. In the years to come, the role of these films will be taken over by television shows such as 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc. - and they actually did better. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly grizzled in this, is the good guy who fights against the evil ones against whom he will eventually win. There is no more interest in what he is going through emotionally than in what his horse feels unless you expect to wonder if he will clarify the first misconception with the female leader at the end. The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the "characters" than the actor is. But that's fine if it floats your boat; And I wouldn't tell you to enjoy "Diagnosis, Murder" either. <br/> <br /> Workman, pedestrian and aging fast. 3 stars to be competently put together 0 for artistic efforts.
