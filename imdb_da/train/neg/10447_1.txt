I chose to watch this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But many people have either really bad taste or someone has got the job. <br /> <br /> Whatever it was a real disappointment. The film is just as stupid and far-fetched as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it goes: It felt like someone had thought: "Wouldn't it be fun to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would be crazy and start biting and things?!? "And it's about it! The foundation is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that nobody in their right mind would recommend to anyone!). The action is bad, and all people are incredible stereotypes. <br /> In summary: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
