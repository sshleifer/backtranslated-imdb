This was a weird movie. It started pretty well. A solid audio track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing. Next comes his "down fall" Here I could tell that I was in for a really cheesy "B" movie. Bad action, I mean, how hard is it to keep a gun and act like a policeman? These guys couldn't. After our psychopath's death scene, we get the opening bonus and the movie starts ... From this point on, it is bad to shop big boobs, the occasional blood cell and poorly finished death scenes. Having said that, I gave the movie a four because, despite its shortcomings, it maintained a kind of foam that I just couldn't shake off. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, but I have to admit that I seem to be worse.
