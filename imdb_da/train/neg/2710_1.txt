Somehow they summed up the 60s, ten years that radically changed our country in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivialized the big events and events, and they "claimed" it was about two families, but you hardly saw the African-American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and embarrassed to vent such waste. What was fun, this happy family, you saw in the beginning, was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend all the major 60 events throughout the country. And the other family was such a non-factor. They devoted maybe five or six scenes to everything for this family. The bad son ... Please NBC, don't make any movies at other times .... leave it to PBS and History Channel
