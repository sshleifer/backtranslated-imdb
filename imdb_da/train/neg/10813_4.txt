The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen all versions of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of Jane's childhood and character was unusual. Then it was as if someone said "Uh, it runs too long" and hacked the rest of the story into strips. The big scenes, when they are included, are glowed over, combined and put in order in such a way that they completely change the storylin. There was so little transition or even stage development that it would be difficult for anyone who didn't even know the story to follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the ending hit it.
