The day has finally come for me to testify to the survival of Azumi's fate as an assassin, a sense of her character and the ultimate attempt to deeper into the world she raged through so ruthlessly in the first story. <br /> <br /> It's as poetic as I get when I talk about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I crumpled the House of Flying Dagger's heavy sentimentality and complained about Aya Ueto's credibility depicting blood-driven assassin, after seeing Azumi 2 I began to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before. <br /> <br /> Not only is the decision of each assassin weak and uninspiring, but also many important elements are omitted from the whole experience. In Azumi 1, we saw the murders use different stealth tactics (which are their first priority) as well as logic to make it easy to work with their characters with quick executions and faster escape abilities. But I won't mind this movie too much, as history is a bit tweaked this time, and many more obstacles have been planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and showing signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly stored for most of the movie and basically plays a toned version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and the sense of threat. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final blow that is the action, simply disguised in the title as the "Death" side of the epic. In the first half of the film, we see debut from many promising opponents with flashy looks and even flashing weapons. To no surprise, they meet their end in some way, but the movie becomes short when each of them begins to die too quickly and too easily. In Azumi 1, the young assailants were predominantly overwhelming with fast, but slightly satisfying battles, and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru over the Azumi 2 games was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced, but they were unable to achieve innovation due to briefness in each meeting. I do not in any way knock down the conventional style of samurai movies with their fast and realistic fights, but characters in both Azumi movies were so imaginative and straight out of the anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched . <<br /> <br /> The romantic side of Azumi is there to fill the time between the battle scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose or makes a much-needed decision. <br /> <br /> As a fan of an open mind for a wide variety of movies and animation, I will not lie and I will admit my neutrality and unimpressiveness to the first Azumi movie, but I will go up and say that after seeing Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what it is worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand the unequal journey of the desperate murder that does their best to restore peace with an inimitable courage to die trying.
