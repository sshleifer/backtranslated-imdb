When I get on IMDb boards, I'm always tired when I see a "worst movie ever" post. After watching this * movie *, I think I will soon create my own post !! <br /> <br /> The opening titles: big, some kind of lame zoom on a gas stove (yes, focus on fire = explosions = great action movie !!) <br /> <br /> The actors: I think the Ice T is a cool rapper, even a great actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes"), but Steven Seagal as a policeman he plays is ... beyond the words. The rest of the casting is ... Well, I don't know where these actors were hired, but jeez !! I bet my dog ​​would have been a much better actor than them! <br /> <br /> The reason: Hijacking.original isn't it? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I told myself well, cool! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics ... I was dead wrong. The rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rental photos taken from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are hilarious, the music is pure crap, the end is happy (I mean, I was happy at the end because the movie was over !!!) My cousin, who watched the movie, was happy (I'm 22, she's 42 ... well). I was on the brink to take the movie and burn it. Maybe next time I want to see it ... (who never said ???)
