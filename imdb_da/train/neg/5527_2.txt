Zombies revolt is bad. There is nothing far away entertaining about the movie. It is boring, lifeless, badly acted and badly scripted. I have often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, and it does well that Dracula looks like a roller coaster. The 65-minute maturity seemed like 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification". A man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. When this happens, he releases the zombies under his control for terrible consequences. That is it. It's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male leadership. He looked so familiar. I had plenty of time to think about this. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before "the zombies revolted" it hit me. That was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as General in White Christmas. It's that I "entertained" myself through most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. Zombies King, on the other hand, is a filmmaking masterpiece compared to this movie. For what it is worth, I give it a 2/10. (I don't want to go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)
