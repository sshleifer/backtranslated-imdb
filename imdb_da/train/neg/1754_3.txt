Why should the stories Mary and Rhoda be so dour? Signed women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? The daughters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can't there be daughters who like their mother's TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why could Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens not be guest stars? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful signs. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together, of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she returns to her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again.
