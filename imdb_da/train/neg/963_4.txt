Chances are a big mistake to see. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something entertaining from him. But I think I must disillusion you. He made a real, really bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to history, Christopher McDonald dies to re-burn as a baby. The children grow up Robert Downey Jr., and Jr. returns to his former hometown, where she meets her former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then Jr's former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr will fall in love with her too. I don't even mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr. is at his worst. He copies Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves she is not fit for acting. Still, there is one thing this unfunny comedy can use: as an antidote to insomnia.
