I really didn't expect this type of movie outside of America. How anyone can take sexually abused children and make it a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) walked around as a kind of child-saving Rambo, was ignorant and insulting to all the children who were sexually exploited all over the world. What is double depressing is the stunning and ground-breaking movie "Happiness" came out the year before this movie. Menges and his cohorts were ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments from the more intelligent viewers out there. They could see the creepy and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is a great cinema show a disgusting amount of ignorance, and you have to see "Happiness" to open your thoughts to the true horror of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold for sexual slavery or be bullied by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... I wonder. If they are to make a film about international child slavery of any kind, they owe it all to make it realistic and emotionally involved instead of this scramble crap. 1.10
