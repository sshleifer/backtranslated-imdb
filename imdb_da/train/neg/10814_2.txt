As a "Jane Eyre" fan, I was thrilled when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will make this book a movie after the story actually written by the author." Wrong!!! If the casting director intended to throw a "Jane" that was clean, he certainly managed. But he could probably have found one that could also act. Where was the excitement between Jane and Rochester? Where was the scary excitement of the novel, as laughter floated in the night apparently from nowhere? Where was the child's spark flirting and dancing like his mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders if the screenwriters actually read the book. What a disappointment
