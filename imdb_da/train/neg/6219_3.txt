When MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was stupid enough to think it would be as warm-hearted as some of the first Lassie movies were. Does not. The story was eerie, the singers from the Sherman brothers were far below their usual level, the characters were uninspired, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY both had much better days. <br /> <br /> I was also interested in seeing what ALICE FAYE's contribution would be as she had been absent on the screen for so many years and was always so picking up in her previous roles with Fox. Alice was also the letdown of the stupid script and the unflattering photograph. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing even extremely interesting for an adult to enjoy - and clearly no magic gift to anyone. You can skip this without missing a thing.
