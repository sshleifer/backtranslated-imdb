Wow, the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago. I want to preface saying that I'm not a fan of narrated episodes. If the story / actors / etc. are worth their salt, they should be able to convey most of the story without having to read it, reminded me of people who can't think of cuffs but rely on teleprometers. The psycho tag was boring and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's just not my cup of tea. They could have kept the story, but at least made it much more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a newspaper reporter or something. Niggling little things like Peugeot are at the house, which has a single semicircle driveway, but he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was under because it is nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. Relaxed editing as she pulls into the driveway (for what seems to be 100's) exactly, who are the 2 guys you look at the 24m30's in the direction of the car as she pulls into the abandoned house? The Dolly close-ups were also overdone, like some Jr. High drama students discover the zoom function of their camera for the first time. I could continue to pick apart, but it could be as boring as this episode was. It continued to pull on, and the true purpose seemed to be using absolutely all the stock footage they had shot by Elaine, who ran the Newport convertible. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a good jingle game while a voice over told us all about the 8-track player, automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends suddenly. No loose ends tied up, nothing explained or completed. Not so many will notice, I suppose most had already changed the channel or off at the end.
