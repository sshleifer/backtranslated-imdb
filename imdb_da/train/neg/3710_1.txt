The king is dead, long live the king! Triad Caddy Shack Two, The Family Under the Stairs and the Troop Beverly Hills had been tied to worst movies ever for such a long time that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... yes ..... everyone hails the new king .... "Down to earth". But some things, such as. Tiny Tim is so bad that they are good. Some day it could take out the infinite "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So go see this .... this .... just take my word for it. Go see it. Everyone hails the new king!
