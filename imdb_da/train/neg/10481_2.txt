The movie is badly cast, except for some well-known old Hollywood names. Other notions of unknown names (ie Jennifer Gabrielle) are uninspiring. I've seen other movies by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the manuscript? <br /> <br /> In a positive tone, Kim Bassing and Pat Morita saved the movie from oblivion. I enjoyed Pat more in the Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to watch, and in short this is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
