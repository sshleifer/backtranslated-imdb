This was not the big disaster I had expected, but it's about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what was going to be fun about this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I find it fun to see morons living their idiotic lives or fooling themselves on television, but then again I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime. I didn't get so sad to see this, but I never enjoyed it either. If you are in the mood to watch a bad movie, but one that is not too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.
