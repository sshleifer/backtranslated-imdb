Muscular male monkey in African jungle is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; The scant daughter of the team leader finds him first. Very-ballyhooed version of the Tarzan story has an OK production, but is paralyzed by the one-sided worst direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek is deprived of inspiration beyond cheesy slow motion action shots and peek-a-boo glimpses of wife Bo Derek's undressed body; He has about as many talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Attempting to be sexual in the heavy-in-the-chain lacks Derek's finesse, snappy timing and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and good-naturedness (they take caution against the winds), but after a promising opening it goes all the way to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have had marble all the time) has the title role, but plays third fool to John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's self-conscious feeling. * from ****
