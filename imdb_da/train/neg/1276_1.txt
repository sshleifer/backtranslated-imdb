This is the only worst movie I've ever seen. Let me say it again: THIS IS THE SINGLE WORST MOVIE I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It had all the ear character of a bad movie: continuity failure, poor writing, poor acting, poor production value, poor music. I thought there were a few points for horror movies. The first is that it should be exciting enough to scare you. This movie becomes and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them, we must take care. This film also gets an F in this regard. <br /> <br /> The first story becomes a woman struck by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her. The next story dies an OCD guy from being careful and talking to a dead friend of his. Oh, and then there's the horrible, nail-biting story of a poor roommate. Come on, can you choose themes a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house, being anal-retent and having a roommate? Shows all those stories where hallucinations, virtual reality are induced by a physician who again uses it himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something I enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. I couldn't do it with this one. It was complete pain to sit and watch. Under no circumstances watch this movie. You will regret it.
