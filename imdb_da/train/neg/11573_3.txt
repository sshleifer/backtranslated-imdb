I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to pay for, and those I found made this one inevitable. How I Feel Feeling! <br /> <br /> First, it should be pointed out that this is a housewife's daytime. The performances are wood, every sentence is an attempt to be "poignant" in the way housewife's daytime and bad soap operas are always, and it is based on the predictable and faithful premise that men (especially soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. . The whole movie is about the "drama" clearly in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop another dimension. <br /> <br /> If it sounds tolerable (or even comfortable) to you, be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, but quite good, is painfully distracting - as it is her face, for some reason. The other notions are undoubtedly a lasting source of embarrassment to their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations such as today's order. There are few surprises, but watch out for Monty Pythonesque's endless supply of food and drink miraculously reflected in the backpacks of the hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I didn't expect action, but I was hoping for beautiful or textured or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas bug story that wants an intelligent audience that is in crisis. It looks under the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You're a fan of predictable 'housewife taking men and winning' television movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood makes it a movie. 4: You have deeply immersed that your emotions are easily touched by unsophisticated storytelling.
