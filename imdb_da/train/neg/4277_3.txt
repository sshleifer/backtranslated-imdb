Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge film string includes both the completely forgettable and the repetitive display (for example John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima") tried his hand at a great musical with "I Dream of Jeanie." He exploited a leading cast of singers with a little past movie experience, and as it turned out almost no future, he spun a fictional and not at all offensive story of the great American songwriter Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is the young law lover, Foster, whose kindness to slaves includes hiding the money for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for a wounded little black boy. His intention is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose carefree younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), slowly realizes she is in love with the almost outrageous singer. Foster is in love with Inez, who is upset by the composer's number 1 on Levee Hit Parade Tune, "O Susannah." Enter minstrel Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to help start Foster's career in profit. <br /> <br /> It's a great production of musical movie standards in the early fifties. The sets are lavish in the particular Hollywood way that portrays fakes with all the trimmings. The singers are not half bad, and the Foster songs are almost impossible to destroy. <br /> <br /> But it is also a literal laundering of the antebellum south. The largest number has black-and-white faces for everyone on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of thought-out racism. If these portrayals of blacks were close to reality, the abolitionists would rightly be condemned for interfering in such a charitable institution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lower into the study vault. Now revived by Alpha Video for only $ 4.99, it is a period of charming songs and repulsive sentimentalization about the victims of America's great crime, slavery. This was what Hollywood set out two years before Brown v. Must have warmed the hearts of some movie guests who carried their linens to the theater.
