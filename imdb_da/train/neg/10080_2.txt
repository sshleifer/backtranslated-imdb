I had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this movie because the title is now an unexpected love. It's not really worth looking for, but I wasn't familiar with both leads and wondered why they were on the head of a lesbian girl at Lifetime. Everything is quite detained, and you don't get an idea of ​​who these characters are, as I could see, I couldn't be emotionally invested in history. I think I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who is. Everything is subdued and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a wise interest in seeing two women do, but it was so discreetly handled that I was disappointed. Hire Personal Best instead.
