This film is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I have used for a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the cinema, you'd say it's hard to imagine, but that's true, it's true! After watching the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and excitement, why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing short of exciting and exciting; Unfortunately, the film is neither of these. <br /> <br /> From the movie, to the script, to the actor, this movie is a complete flop. If you read this, plan to go to the movie, expecting some excitement, mystery, action, horror or anything but a waste of an hour and 45 minutes, I'm afraid you're disappointed. <Br /> <br /> "Why is it so bad," you may ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor exciting. Nothing about the movie made me at least "on the edge," frightened or curious. The script was at best ridiculous. There were many times throughout the film, where the dialogue was just so ridiculous, I started to write it out as comic relief to find out just a few seconds later that it wasn't. The action was absolutely horrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but it was a lady. Without exception, all performances in this movie were incredibly below average. The kinematics were horrible with no moment of excitement or mystery. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away. I'm not usually a very tough critic. Frankly, when I go and see a comedy, I will laugh, and when I go to see a mystery / excitement / horror, I'll just be surprised. This movie was boring, badly acted, poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and see something else.
