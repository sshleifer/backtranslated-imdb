The film confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it does not create coherent arguments against the death penalty at any level. By presenting the lawful execution of a doomed murder as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind, the film raises a parenting order to the status of martyr to Christ. Somehow it is according to the plot that God is furious that society has chosen to get rid of it even by a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while sleeping defenselessly in their beds. Yet the same god has no indignation for the killer's actions. The protagonist, a non-religious, pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but incredible attempt to unsuccessfully rescue this sentenced murderer. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returns as a powerless and frustrated vagabond for the symbolic release of God's wrath. Christ's modern lack of incarnation not only accuses him but also of the religious ideal of all religions. He is incapable of influencing mankind for good and unemotionally skating the edges of life and waiting for humanity to destroy it himself. Meanwhile, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds himself with little help from Jesus himself with the ability to reincarnate in his newborn rare child, who somehow saves all mankind from the wrath of the Almighty. I have also interpreted it as a statement in support of abortion at some levels. This film, which tries to weave many religious themes into a thriller, fails to do any religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. It raises many questions that it never even tries to answer. It overrides the religious values ​​of its audience while attempting to portray an Asian version of their fulfillment. Silly
