Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which doesn't say much anyway, I'd rather see paint dry) it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid everything from these Low Budget Pictures guys. I was suckered to buy a few DVDs to support some indy filmmakers and boy did I reprint it. Some are not even officially "released" yet (not bootlegs bought from the filmmakers themselves) and I can't even figure out how bad they all are. Avoid everything with Teen Monkey or Bonejack in them as they pop up in other small indy movies with which they are friends. If you are friends of these guys, chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them. But for those who had to see them? No way. Poor video, bad sound, bad acting, bad plot ... etc. These are not even fun. I gave this one a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is in it and it's about it. Maybe it doesn't even deserve 2. If a 1 1/16 star to show it was a little better than the first one (which I wish I could have judged in the negatives). If you want a decent no budget movie, get something from LBP's "friends" over to Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even raise the bet. It is actually decent.
