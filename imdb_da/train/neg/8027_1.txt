I saw this movie. Finally. And it really wasn't easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost every detail stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can't believe the decision makers take this seriously. Even harder to believe is how this "product" made it to VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch a horror movie, just watch "Scream", but if you want to laugh aloud and good time, see some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing their inability to see dark areas.
