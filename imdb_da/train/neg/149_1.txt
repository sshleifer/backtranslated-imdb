Now you know the rest! This must be the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I can only imagine Stephanie Beaham having some bills to pay when he took over this role. <br /> <br /> The main role is played by (to me) a completely unknown, and I can imagine I just disappeared back in turmoil right after this turkey. Bruce Lee led the martial art load in the early 70s, and since then, fighting scenes must be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses quick cuts to show martial arts, but even this can't spoil the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a blow. An average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this view. Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this doesn't win the golden raspberry for its year.
