Anyone who loved the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this movie. All the magic and romance have been modernized from its original story of a girl who does a good job for a mysterious old lady and given "three" in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three rides into the 19th century on a dishonest elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time to the Top. Second, everything is in good time.
