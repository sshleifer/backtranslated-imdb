After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel warm, you're pretty confident it will be a great romantic comedy. So the movie takes a trip to worse. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling can still be there, but as others have said, the reason becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to see. <br /> <br /> The movie is set up and you get the impression that you are either fast forward through it or that the manufacturers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut out many scenes. Realism is not a measure of itself, but as a viewer I am quite convinced that this comedy is not deliberately unrealistic, it just happens to be. <br /> <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad script, I think the actors' performances are mostly good. If I could only judge the first 25 minutes, I'd probably give it an eight. As it is now it becomes a four. ... And that's good! <br /> <br /> If you are a sucker for romantic comedies, you probably have a good time anyway. If not, I recommend that you see something else.
