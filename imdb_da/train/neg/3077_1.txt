Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master of this movie. He had the brilliance of producing a movie with actors who couldn't act. Besides that, he chose to write a script based on some kind of bad acid trip that had gone wrong. Put it together, you end up with a film that sucks more than one store filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain it caused is about as great as the pain caused by your genitals having cut out with a spoon and then having the whole wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
