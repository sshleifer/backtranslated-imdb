I loved the Batman TV series and really looked forward to this. But they tried to do too much. Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to restore the batmobil was over me. I don't want to knock Burt or Adam the way they look now ..... It's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was a little sorry. I'd rather just watch the ex-stars comment. The batmobile side story was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and far too much. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I would like more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for about a minute each to just tell the same things I already knew. Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was a former smoker. That's it on them 2. <br /> <br /> I'd like to read the book. I'm sure it has more to do with this. Like why there were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. As I said, even those in this were hardly in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really corny.
