Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy and thought it would be fun fun. That's it without the fun. This movie is truly mindless, it is absent from any plot or character development, or any kind of story. The basic problem with this movie is the kittens and the gore. Basically, every kill looks exactly right. ZOmbies rip someone apart. Yes, it's okay, but you also need some original killings. I mean, it got really low, every kill so exactly the same, filmed the same way. What killed me. I love Gore, and Gore in this movie didn't do anything for me. It was just boring. No story, just the same lame scene over and over with another person. I would also like this movie. I love shot on video gore movies ... like Redneck Zombies. But I couldn't break myself. This movie has good points, but none of them are in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped out with the flood, and there were over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world. But overall, this is a horrible movie.
