I don't know who got the idea that orcas are killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge, but my god is absurd. Orcas is definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them be ... its stupid. Orcas is extremely intelligent, does not confuse me, but I doubt very much that they know and understand a concept of revenge. So I have to say everything I came out of this movie was the entertainment of how obstructed it was. So I was at least a little entertained by it. Personally, I recommend going to see Jaws if you want to see an Animal-Killing-Humans type movie. But if you are like me and want to laugh at something so far from realism then I would say go ahead. : D
