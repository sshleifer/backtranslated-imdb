OK, forget all the technical disagreements or the physical impossibilities that the shuttle is randomly launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold. Forget about the hideous special effects and badly constructed one-dimensional characters. Just look at the premise of the story. The reason why the movie should exist in the first place and you will see how badly this movie was pieced together. <br /> <br /> I know 9 year olds who look at this insult to intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is horrible. The action is comical, and the message that tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse is that wired Movie Channels NOTE SHOW IT! Its twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone in their real mind think that people will see this painful part of celluloid several times, much less to see it at all? My recommendation does not even break to use the energy to see this thing. It's just not worth it.
