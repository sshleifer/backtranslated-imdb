This is an art film made either in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the movie clearly seems to be highly indicative of this general time period - with some camera work and pop art stylings that are clean in the late 60s-early 70s. <br /> <br /> The movie is made up of three simple images that are distorted by various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music, and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. This was, of course, calculated as almost as a form of performance art, and as in most performances it is interesting first but quickly becomes tiring. The movie, to put it even more blunt, is a total drill and would appeal to no one, but perhaps those who made the movie, their family and friends, and perhaps a few people just too hip and "with it" to be understood by us deadly.
