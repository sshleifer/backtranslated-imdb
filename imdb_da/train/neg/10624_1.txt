In an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says "The truth is that the Americans are using a secret aluminum anti-radiation alloy. It's not so well known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it If they were in a space race with the Russians, it would be very silly to reveal that they had new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. "This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no "secret" to radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available. It uses a light "honeycomb" made of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except of the windows, of course) is covered by a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom facing forward during re-entry. These materials are actually * better * by stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a concrete problem for * long-term * spaceflight due to the risk of big sunlight. But it was simply not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The command module gave them quite good protection during their short (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 straps, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (of which 12 landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86).
