The point of the greatly expanded preparation phase of this Star's Born story seems to be making ultimate success, the more sublime. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as an inappropriate young woman imprisoned within herself, but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame, both of whom overcome and profit from this secession. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting lessons, we never see her perform the teacher's instructions. Having suffered through Esther's (largely self-inflicted) pain in scary detail, we do not get a convincing sense of her triumph. The obsessive presence of the hero's pain seems to be intended as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. Nevertheless, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual fraud) never come together in a coherent whole. A 163-minute movie with a simple plot should be able to knit its loose ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go before an audience.
