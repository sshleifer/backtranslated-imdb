There is absolutely no reason in this movie ... no sign development ... no climax ... nothing. But have some good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So there you go ... as a movie in general is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless flick that offers nothing but a good action scene then watch this movie. Do not expect anything more, just that.It works and a not so bad direction .. A few cameos from Kimbo and Carano ... I was out to see Carano a little more in this movie .. she is a good giant and a real hot girl .... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art. Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... it would be great
