This is one of the movies I remember being in the can for many years before anything happens to it. I don't think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is at best flimsy. Cast is pretty good in what they are given, but again you are only as good as the script. Baldwin directs this even though I could have sworn, he didn't lead the whole thing, I thought I was reading somewhere, or there were not so many resumes but he certainly has some potential in there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of genius and should keep him busy for some time longer. I just hope the show curves gracefully a la Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years passed. So if you want to see a movie that you don't get much of, but it will not really hate it, it is also for you. I can't remember the last time a movie had been packed so long before it was finally released and only on DVD on it. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet many people have seen "The Edge". Now download the excellent movie for some real entertainment.
