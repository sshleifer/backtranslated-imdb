Sentinel represents everything about Hollywood's souls and the carefree lack of imagination found in so many movies these days. I might not think of a good thing about it, it's so generic, so factory-made and so lazy that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, unworthy audience. <br /> <br /> A secret service agent plot plans to murder Prez could be entertaining. If handled by a good director or caringly thrown, it is. Douglas is the one framed. Basinger is the first lady with whom he has an affair (an undeveloped, unsolved plot contrivance). Sutherland is the best friend who thinks he's guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and ... that's it. I guess there are fewer demands for women when they enter the Secret Service. As usual in a movie like this, the role of the preacher is nothing more than a tool, a sign, and is very poorly written. Clark Johnson is the one who gave us just as pathetic SWAT back in 2003, lacks mechanical direction any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and talk into their distant performances. Eva Longoria, the most vulnerable woman of the 21st century, is basically only here to attract the Desperate Housewives audience. Her role is 100% meaningless, and she does absolutely nothing to promote the plot or add to character development. She hardly has 2 lines to rub together. A really shameless marketing trick. <br /> <br /> If you're a glutton for punishment don't let me stop you. But it is time and money you will not return.
