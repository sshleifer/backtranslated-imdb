I didn't know if I was to laugh or cry at this erroneous representation of Canadian history, especially the bad service made to the mounted police history in Yukon. <br /> <br /> I leave it to Pierre Berton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the final story of the Klondike Gold, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my astonishment with this silly movie: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​a pristine border, subdued by individual heroes armed with six weapons, continued in Farland, another story of a cowboy from the American West - Wyoming this time - driving his herd of beef in goldland. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real disagreement is the great assumption on which the plot becomes? that there was only one police officer installed throughout the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not cope with lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs ship is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where's the constable?" Ask Brennan. "Up on the Pelly River. Chilkats Problems," someone replies. He has a really hard work, the constable. He patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he doesn't come home for two or three months at a time. "The historical truth is that during the gold rush, the Yukon Territory was the closest thing to a police state that British North America has ever seen. The northwest mounted police station was stationed in the territory in significant numbers long before the Klondike strike, controlling each route into the Yukon, and they did not bend any nonsense, the customs duties charged, often over the new arrivals, made arbitrary on-site navigation and flood Men left if they did not have sufficient supplies or if they simply looked bad, in true Canadian fashion, laid the moral laws of society.In Dawson, the Lord's Day Act was strictly adhered to: it was a crime punishable by a fine for to cut your tree on Sunday, and lumpy young women were arrested for what the Polish police called "giving a risqué performance in the theater", generally no more than dancing e suggestive on stage in too revealing tights. <br /> <br /> In such a society, a gun belt was unthinkable. An infamous Tombstone poor man, trying to pack a weapon on his hip, was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just pushed him from a salon for the rugged crime to speak too loudly. The bad man went like a lamb, but protested when the policeman, when he discovered that he had a gun, told him to hand it over. "No one has yet taken a gun away from me," said the American. "Well, I take it," said the constant, softly and without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned by the police for as little as a dollar and bought as souvenirs to hold on to the mantle. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the big year of the stampede was not a serious crime ?? let alone a murder ?? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the US side, which was a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, the Denver Confidence Man, was remarkable. But in the distant land Dawson is seen as a community without any law, as a soapy Smith character from Skagway ?? he is called gannon in the picture ?? can easily control. (In fact, one of Smith's men trying to cross the border was confiscated all his equipment and was frogmarched right back by a mounted police officer). <br /> <br /> {in the movie says the lonely Mountie} "Yes, I'm the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it." <br /> "Why is there no more of you?" <br /> <br /> "For yesterday it was a wilderness. We didn't expect you to pour into the thousands. Now that you are here we are protecting you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "There will be a speech established here in Dawson in May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May? You're going to be here to keep track? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br />" What about the rest of the time? " > <br /> "Choose a good man. He in. get him to act as a marshal ??? <br /> <br /> the movie mountie leaves and does not reappear in the picture His amazing suggestion that an American town hall hall, complete with tin star, is sworn in by a group of citizens living under British jurisprudence accepted. Of course, they want to make the Jimmy Stewart marshal, he clearly fits that part. But Stewart plays the role of Loner looking for number one, And then another man is chosen to be shot, and he does, others are shot, even though Walter Brennan is shot, Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he has to end all shootings with some shooter. He foams on the tin star, and he and the bully, Gannon, burst into each other in the inevitable western climax. <br /> <br /> To anyone with a passing knowledge of the Canadian North, this bald repeats whether history passes rational faith. <br /> <br /> excerpts from Hollywood Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
