Nightmare Weekend is proof that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies', they are ready to do just about anything. I am not referring to the countless women who seem to be quite happy to get out stronger in this terrible piece of trash can (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to co-star with a badly made towel called George. Now it's embarrassing! <br /> <br /> A bio-electronic created by the brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (resembling a demented felt wool with green wool for hair) is the artificially intelligent interface to an advanced computer system that drives a revolutionary device (a silver ball about the size of a golf ball) which, when ingested, can reverse character disturbances. <br /> <br /> Edwards personality-changing experiments have been successful in laboratory animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to conduct human trials fearing that there may still be side effects. However, his evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster) has no such nausea and continues to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all become mutilated mutants. <br /> <br /> With special effects with basement basement, one casts completely without talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes when I watched movies, and even then I am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is correct), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster that cannot even save more soft-core sex scenes and a touch of gore. <br /> <br /> This movie also features one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman wearing the idiot, bending away to crap 80's music in a way which makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
