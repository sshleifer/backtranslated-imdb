Saying Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. I can really get into a good art house film, even a surreal and twisted feature like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll. <br /> <br /> In all ways, FFFC tries to be so deep and intellectual that there is essentially no substance in this movie. This movie is poorly finished, the visuals in this movie are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS, but it was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant. It was trying to be deep and meaningful, I think, but it is just pretentious disoriented nonsense. Freshman movie students without a camera could do something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar brothers and stand-up routines between sketches get 1 point each, everything else is just bad paced, pseudo-creative, heavy hands trying to be as good as movies of other real leaders like Sogo Ishii , David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people who rage about the FFFC do it because they have no idea what they saw because it was only mildly relevant statements here and there mixed with stupidity and mixed until you jumped on your own shoe. <br /> <br /> This movie was an extreme disappointment that came out of the tall Survive Style 5+ movie that actually has meaning combined with excellent exploitation of scenery, filmography, captivating dialogue, fun moments , good soundtrack, excellent performances, great pacing and flow. FFFC has the exact opposite in every way, boring landscape (20 minutes staring at a gentle beach at night? A completely white scene? Alien balls floating in white space? A dinky school hall and then a ... school hall?), Horrible movie, forgettable dialogue, nothing funny or humorous, scared the fact that you just wasted your life in two hours, soundtrack, amateur performances, uneven, uneven and often flat in a row, zero flow at all. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim this, it makes FFFC a great movie that it is so unconventional in every turn that it is pure genius. It is simply a way of striking one's own ego, because the "unpredictable" could be a good quality for a movie if it was not combined with "boring", "before" and "horrible". Personally, I have spoken to two people who admitted that the FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave at the elitist art house made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a ... "Hey it was well i liked it. "<br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot down, this movie is slop, I don't care if Roger Ebert says this movie is the best he ever has seen since he lost his own virginity. "Emperor's new robe" I say ... this movie is not a guide to other psychedelic / trippy movies coming from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even with a low budget) and no one can honestly be compared to Survive Style 5+. Just watch FFFC if you are interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget.
