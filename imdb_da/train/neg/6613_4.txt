I'm a big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma, but I couldn't believe he made this movie. I was really disappointed. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere near the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan shouldn't have made this movie. Ajay and Sushmita then tried their best, but no use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather meaningless. Mohanlal did full justice and again proved that the action is about facial expressions and body language. The rest of the casting was under expectation. The comedy situation, which was adapted from the original sholay, falls flat in this movie. Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the manuscript, but because of the controversy that was surrounded by the film, he shook and just blamed him to make this act. But there is no fire.
