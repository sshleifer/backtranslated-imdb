Don't get the impression from other reviewers that this movie stinks because it is ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which is morally no worse than the American meat trade or the Scottish haggis cull) it stinks because it's pretentious tosh, that kind of up-its-own-behind guff that gets modern art a bad name. That said, there are some amazing pictures, but there are fantastic pictures in the average bus tour if you use your imagination so there is no need to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat gets jaded, and then it begins again when you think it's finished. I saw it in a porn movie theater in Rome that had been hired for the weekend to show Barney's film works, which is an admirable and smart way to regain what had once become a local flute from the dirty old men in Mac's brigade. But if the trendy young stuff and the slightly older bearded Bjork fans were to be honest, everyone could have had a lot more fun if they had just shown one of the porn!
