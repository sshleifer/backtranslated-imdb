Bizarre take on the Cinderella story. Terribly bad script, but Kathleen Turner turns to a pretty decent evil stepmor performance. <br/> <br /> Visually amazing in some parts, but it's about it. Period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minute drive. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "The Glass Slipper".
