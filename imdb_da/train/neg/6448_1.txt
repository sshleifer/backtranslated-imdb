Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called unknown film. This movie is a piece of shit right from the start. It has a really stupid "plot", really pathetic "play" and so-called "special effects." <br /> <br /> Some thirty-year-old "post-teens" are trapped in the woods with an acidic, reptilian, rubber dusting that infects endlessly. What you get with this movie is a lot of talk and precious little action. You have girls who go through the woods and talk, and then you have guys (with heavy mascara on) going through the woods and talking. It's all so boring! <br /> <br /> The very essence is rarely seen through most of the film. When shown, the image is distorted to dampen the fact that it is a man in a rubber boot, and the movement shows that it is a suit, and therefore the cause of the image's blur and distortion. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in any side of the word, and those here who have praised the most likely are the people who were taken out of the street to "act" in this really stupid movie! Skip this for sure!
