"Tapeheads", a scrappy, intermittent fun spoof of the music video business, could have been the perfect comic card, and the stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortless in the swing of the incoherent chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles, starting their own company Video Aces and making fun videos for groups, parties and a death star. It's too bad that the filmmakers had to invent a weak side plot to start the time (shenanigans involve a skewed politician and his henchmen who don't do much, except to take away the film's primary strength, send the music to the late 80s ). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a few originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are at the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They are the right thing in companions. * 1/2 from ****
