This is supposed to be a comedy, but mostly bad taste, and nothing distant that causes a smile in the movie. The film is about a couple trying a child, and the real-life people who are in that situation will twist the depictions depicted. Eg. Scenes in a fertility clinic are not least fun and are rather annoyingly embarrassing. The male leader who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a bad excuse for a rejection from Village People. The female leader tries to look 20 years younger than she is. Both wires come across as unpleasant, unattractive and totally convincing. There are various ridiculous and completely unpleasant free scenes in the movie, for example with a low cost airline that is without humor. The only reason to give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a mark of Shirley Maclaine, who is a class above everything else in the picture, and a mark of half a half proper (though old) music.
