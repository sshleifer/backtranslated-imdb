In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to party. Meanwhile, they call American nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their inner fears. A serial killer listening to their confessions makes their nightmare a reality and kills every one of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a strange low-budget movie that has a terrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday 13th. Then the story changes to a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this moment on, history has great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance and also shows some beautiful breasts and bare bodies as usual in this type C production. But the end of the manuscript does not give any explanation for the killing instinct and motives of nurse Jane Toppan's behavior, giving the feeling that the budget ended before the end of the shooting. With a better beginning and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
