Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was pretty entertaining for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting, and the main character was a little cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was awful. Really. I don't know why I thought it was fun before, but now ... I didn't laugh at all. There was nothing even entertaining. It was just stupid. History was weak. The action was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie, but still the actor is at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> What's the worst is that this movie is racist. Really. Don't get me wrong, I'm not usually complaining about racism in movies. But I've seen people complain about the lack of black men in movies like 'Shaolin Temple' or that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad or ... Whatever you get point. There are people who see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like 'The Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white guy in the whole movie and he is the leader of the evil. All the good guys are African Americans. Don't forget me, I don't care, the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I don't care about is that we can hardly see a white person in this movie. It's the only movie I've ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie, which is the case with 'The Street Fighter', there is no problem - in Japan, most of the Asians are. But if there is only one white man in an American movie, there is some kind of problem - in the US, most of them are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with all-white cast and only an Asian as a bad guy. Just not really. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the movie the speed 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I didn't have fun with it as a kid.
