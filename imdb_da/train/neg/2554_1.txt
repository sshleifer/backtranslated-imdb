Honestly, I don't even speak when I say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This movie does not have a single ounce of originality in its sparse dialogue or its blatantly plagiarized story line. I can't even start counting the number of things in this movie that is obviously ripped off by "The Omen" and other movies like that. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this movie is actually one of the devil's minions sent to rule and protect Satan's alley ..... sounds like Mrs Baylock to someone else. Another thing is that the orphanage was that they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted, as in "The Omen". But fortunately a priest survived the flames and escaped with burns throughout his body .... another coincidence ?????? And on top of that, the burned priest remains in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus over walls, like the pastor in "The Omen" who has sides of the Bible that are brushed on the walls as wall papers. Don't let me even start comparisons between the end of this movie and "The Omen" for you, because as I mentioned above, there are far too many to mention here.
