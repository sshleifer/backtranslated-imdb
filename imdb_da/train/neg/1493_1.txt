I really don't understand how people made this movie and thought it was worth all the work they had put into it. Even more amazing are those who saw this movie without feeling cheated for 88 minutes to do something valuable like cleaning under the sofa or reading Leviticus. First of all, they probably could have found 2 real Irish people, and some great women who could deliver their lines better than the rinsed, head pornstars sprinkled all over this movie. Permitted, gore works - but strangely, it's not as worrying as you might think seeing organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (past) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their terrible inhuman actions, you just want them to die in pain. <br /> <br /> So if you don't even care about the following: <br /> - acting (seriously, all sucked. I've never seen this before. ALL sucked). <br /> <br /> Plot (some crazy horror movies are far linear or at least surprising. movies don't make sense unless you're as rubbish as the authors of course). <br /> <br /> Theme (Nothing to learn from this movie. Nothing to be afraid of in bed at night, nothing to consider or understand or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as plain and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - Scenes (could have been the movie's saving grace, but no ... nothing gratifying here. Even the rocks are fake). So yes. If you don't care about it and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. Positive comments: Interesting filmography at times, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic to do; Again, wasted. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree with mutant disembowelment solves the problem of false accent.
