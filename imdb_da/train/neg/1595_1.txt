The movie seemed to appeal to me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was of course and did not have as much interest as the other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same corny humor and cliche bad guys. The movie wasn't to do if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The movie should not be better associated with animations such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are at no level that rises to the standards of original animation. It's also a shame to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more an anime and does not fall anywhere near Pokemon. This is the second movie to be released in late 2002.
