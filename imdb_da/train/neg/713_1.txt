Can I please say first of all that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up for IMDb specifically to review it. And my review? This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Synopsis of the movie sounded interesting, Nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the movie file failed to bring all these elements together properly. Remember the episode of South Park that featured manatees writing Family Guy using idea ball? Should these manatees also write Unholy? Its like the author wanted to include all these different ideas, but had no idea how to link them all together, and to make things even less sensible, including a Donnie Darko-esquire time travel theme to the end that destroyed the chronology. <br /> <br /> I could tell it early that this was a bad movie. Special effects were too low for something better than direct to DVD. The action was not great, but in fairness I have seen worse. I want to praise the Nazi paintings, they were scary, but the evil Nazi butcher guy was just comical. <br /> <br /> I don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even in the horror genre. But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been told, it would have been a good movie. But it has been overhyped. Waaaaay over hyped.
