The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive cover of VHS made me buy and watch this flick, expecting to see a good teen slash movie. What a crap! Full of clich√© scripts, dialogues and performances are horrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible ?? summary, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just a completely boring story with shameful plot points. The movie begins with six characters, in fact three pairs, together as a group of friends, but in fact very ugly people who seem to be enemies play a ridiculously meaningless game called "Taboo" and with each one write yes or no to certain taboo issues. That is it: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationships. Then there is an ellipse for a year later, and the same group is gathered in a New Year's Eve that offends each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and twists are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre, and incredible that doesn't deserve any further line in my review. Only one advice: Don't waste your time or money on this waste, you will definitely regret it. My voice is a (terrible) one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo ?? Playing with the killer")
