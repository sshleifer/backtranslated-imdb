Dear me. Where do I start? Dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's father. He is corpsed on camera for the first 5 minutes of the film. The favored exclamation in this movie is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. Subjects are completely incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People 'rush' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH. The world seems to be going as normal, but these must be final days. Breasts appear for the sake of the breasts. Normally, such an approach would give some redemption, but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or humanity's future. There is a dog without reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach. The general and his catchphrase of "Shut f ** k up!" is the only redemption feature. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent and killed themselves.
