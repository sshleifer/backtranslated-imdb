Bad Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion that is taking place. People just look at her and say, "Oh, what would you know you were the star of" Theodore Rex ". How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this horrible piece of shit? Even small children would be pampered in horror at this thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters'. In fact, come to think of it, "Sigmund" was far better than this. <br /> <br /> Was it done, though? By imposing an illegal substance on the producer before telling him about it? Look at this hideous abomination at your own risk.
