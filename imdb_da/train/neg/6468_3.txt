That's a good thing The result came together for Marlon Brando as goodbye, because I hate to think of him who goes for free money. Not what his fans should remember him by. <br /> <br /> In his last year, Brando looks more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of movie Welles would have done looking for funding for his own work. Brando is the leader of a local prison, which in America, when in a small rural setting, is usually the largest employer in the area. It gives someone who is responsible for a lot of gaps. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has a weakness he pamperes, his two twin bimbos, otherwise known as daughters. Even when they become pregnant by a couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts are still associated with their father. <br /> <br /> Not to fear because Brando is willing to give them jobs in prison where they work under conditions not much better than the prisoners have. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train that goes through the site, where they often carry spent money to be burned by the treasury. <br /> <br /> While free money has some moments of humor, it's mostly right under all the talents involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his death daughter, but also FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the cast came to work with someone who many classify as the greatest American actor of the last century. Was it not for Brando's presence, and it was about 40 years earlier, Free Money would play in the drive-in circuit of the Red Rock America, where the people could see how they were satirized. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt is made to satirize them.
