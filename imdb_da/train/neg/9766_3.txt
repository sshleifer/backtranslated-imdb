Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was unilaterally responsible for some of my favorite horror movies ever (such as the Edgar Allen Poe adaptations "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum") as well as some inappropriate cheap and sticky waste forces (like "The Creature of the Haunted Sea" and " She Sharks Reefs God "). Corman also made a couple of movies that are just unclassifiable and ?? to make a long story short ?? almost impossible to judge correctly. "The Trip", for example, as well as this imaginative term "Gas-s-s-s" can be felt as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, the incredibly strange hippie culture is influenced by movies. Half of the time you have no idea what is going on, who these characters are going back and forth through the screen and where hell this whole thing goes. The reason is simply and yet highly effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas has been accidentally released and wiped out all over the world population at the age of 25. This * could be the basic prerequisite for an atmospheric, gritty and nail biting exciting post-apocalyptic sci-fi landmark, but author George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to make it a "trippy" road-movie comedy. None of the signs even try to prevent their inevitable coming deaths; they just party out on the street and find small youth criminal syndicates. "Gas-s-s" is a disappointingly boring and trying too hard to be bizarre. The whole script seems to be improvised on the spot and not at all fun. Definitely not my cup of tea, but the movie has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who should I say it's not worth your time or money?
