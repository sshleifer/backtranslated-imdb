This mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much larger budgets and greater ambitions. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. If it wasn't so long (almost 3 hours) I think children would like it a little. It has adventures, action, "cliffhanger scenes", and not too much romance or other "icky" stuff. When you're young, you're not too critical of bending rubber swords, campy acting and repeating scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, just as it was done in old-fashioned series to bring the audience up quickly.) Finally, the children are usually more opposed to American English dialogue coming out of the mouth of Asian players. (Not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non-Asian players.) <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie three stars, but I felt like director, producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least completing the project. This movie is not art, but like painting your house, it actually took time, effort and discipline to get it done. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a recommended use for your time, but it can keep the kids entertained while traveling in the minibus. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... hi, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell check seems to think that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
