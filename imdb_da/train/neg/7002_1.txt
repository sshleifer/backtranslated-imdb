I've seen this movie and the other. Trinity is my name and I find that this is worse than the first. I have no idea why they made another movie themselves, it was stupid and pointless to say I have them all. I've put them many times and it still drives me to turn off 5 minutes into the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just drove me up the wall. If it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it could have been funner and worth the $ 5 I spent buying any movie. But you make mistakes, so I want to save your money and not goodbye to this movie or any of those who go with it, trust me.
