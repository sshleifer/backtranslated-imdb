This is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey'. Finding this seemed strange at the time, as it was evidence that there are still posters for the film at the local Cineplex Odeon. Having seen such classics as "Any Which Way But Loose" and "Project X", these two guys who reckon with monkeys movies are awesome. <br /> <br /> These guys were on a long trip as they watched this movie. There was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained in Shakespeare's plays. Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck would have helped the boys. The idea that a strong sidekick would help as a Jackie Chan or heck might even be Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet Li look-a-like Matthew Modine. While some may claim that Matthew Modine does not come close to Jet Li, the camera shows tricks that he is just as good. When it becomes obvious that an uneducated chimpanzee cannot cope with the movie, the movie on Matthew Modine puts it to the real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is some dorky child developing a bond with Modine and the monkey? Is there a possibility that the child learns confidence and even captures a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine was going to be jealous of this one (to use the pick-up line "I'm second fiddle to a monkey" doesn't seem to work with the ladies.) Shortly after seeing this movie the two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine and told them 'seven days'.
