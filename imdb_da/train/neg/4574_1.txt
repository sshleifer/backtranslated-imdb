I went into this movie and expect it to look like The Matrix or Pi. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written, badly acted plot in the movie (with CG animated cells and peptides for booting). However, the real focus on the movie is that "expert" speaker spits out new age, feels good mushrooms in between segment segments. It's probably what is innocent enough. There is a bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. For example, it states that electrons exist as both particle and wave, and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the film takes a huge (and unscientific) leap and says that subatomic quantum effects also occur on large scales. The talking heads take it even longer. According to them, the following are true: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, natives could not see their ships because their minds were unable to perceive anything so different. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. - With positive thinking you can go on water. -These thoughts can change the shape of ice crystals in bottles of water. <br /> <br /> Hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This movie felt like a movie they would show you to get you into a cult. After making my homework I realized that it really is. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be seen as a fighting comedy (although one is not fun). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: Don't watch this movie.
