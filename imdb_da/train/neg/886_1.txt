A few years back the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Who were imperfect but very comfortable (my rating was a 7), created this waste on New York City. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I love you (J'taime) created a feel for Paris and it was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current movie, I didn't recognize New York City, I didn't feel like I was in my birthplace. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 cities, I saw no scenes in The Bronx or Queens. There is a scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes of the beautiful hotels or theaters. It has a great cast, most of the performing artists were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest kind. The very few humorous moments are all a course sexual nature or insulting to the many fine New Yorkers we all know and love .. <br /> <br /> A few of the films nominated for the raid prices were far better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> I am thinking that the title should have been <br / > <br /> NEW YORK, I hate you.
