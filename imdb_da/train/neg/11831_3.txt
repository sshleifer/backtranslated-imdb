I do not understand how these animated films continue to come out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is, people love it. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my two children (5,7). They like everything that is animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full and I was delighted to see the movie with its amazing cast. To tell the truth, I was sorry about that stupid. It was incredibly predictable and simply unfunny. There were a few chuckles in the whole movie and that was it. Of course they tried again and again to get the cheap laugh, but they just didn't work. My son almost always tells me that he wants the DVD when we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep halfway through. Also the kids thought character animation looked strange. I haven't heard from them since to see The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type who is looking for the negative in everything. But the quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.
