Richard Pryor's early 80s, running down the street by fire, must have affected him somehow. In his stand up, he testifies that it will be well laughing. It seemed to have done something that involved the projects he chose. The toy is about the lamest he has ever chosen, except I guess another. <br /> <br /> A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little underlying politically incorrect for you was such a thing. Richard sees all the emotions that eventually made me go out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor come straight with this abrupt but it will be the misunderstood kid's nauseum! At least, Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and see Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his 70's stuff. This is a waste of any movie watcher time!
