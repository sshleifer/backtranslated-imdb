I've read every book to date in the left behind series, and the movie hardly makes any of them fair. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors read their lines, instead of actually telling them. The signs were stiff and unlikeable. The effects were cheesy and so very fake. The finish was horrible. First of all, it didn't even go through the first book. Second, it made no sense. If you hadn't read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It should have been the most cheesy, film-making end I've ever seen in a movie. I'm sorry I actually paid money for this movie. If, by some miracles, it becomes very widespread, they should completely overtake it and let Hollywood take over. The two wannabe film producers and the wannabe director should leave filmmaking to professionals.
