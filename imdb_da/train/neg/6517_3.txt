I went to a screening of this movie and while it had a few moments that made me laugh, it had some very big mistakes. First and foremost, it presents itself to the humorous exploitation of a spouse's divorce attempting to find love in LA. What it morphs into is a depressing, narcissistic and unfunny romp through the history of movie director's love life and professional life. Witnesses wear out quickly and you suddenly find yourself not worried about how this man's dates progress. The ridiculous thing is that the director at the same time presents himself as an extremely annoying and highly flawed character and then expects us to be concerned.
