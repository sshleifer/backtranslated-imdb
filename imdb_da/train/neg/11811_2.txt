You know when you are on the bus and someone decides to tell their life story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is to relax and go away? Well, I had a similar feeling while watching this movie. Okay, I actually chose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste of making herself the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last episode from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti madre of all kinds. Caro Diario was fun, unusual, and at least a few other characters managed to get a word at the edges. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-powered water that is about how his politics are best, or what outrageously popular culture tickles in his desire at the moment. He also finds time to turn off movies he doesn't like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely, being in a position like his, you would think he would try to make a point about cinema a little more intelligent than this. By making a proper movie, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that is not entirely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he began fading over his newborn baby, I would just go and be in the company of any normal, preferably not self-confident, film director with a strange love of sticky music. The next time someone you don't know is trying to tell their life story, give them a blow from me. Each battle will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism.
