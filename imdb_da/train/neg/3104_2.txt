I made a lot of reviews on IMDb, and this movie is unique because I never saw the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and unfunny that I just couldn't sit through it - even though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie I call the "Mel Quota". In other words, the better his movie, the less of him you see in the movie. Think about it - The producer and Young Frankenstein were great movies and he was hardly in them. BUT movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are shock full of Mel and are pretty dopey movies (yes, I didn't like Space Balls - but that's not the place to talk about it). <br /> <br /> Second, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can't think of a less fun topic than homelessness. This is just a comedy breaker. Think about it, guys. The FUNNIEST (?) Scene in the movie has Mel who makes Whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster !! And it's fun in what way?
