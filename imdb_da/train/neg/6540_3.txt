I can't believe so many compare this movie to Argento's. His work is far more imaginative and malicious - and very fun. <br /> <br /> The director just lacks the ability to build real excitement. The murder scenes - and let's see, that's what this genre is about - is not interesting. It was not hard to guess who the killer was and I really didn't care when it was revealed. The cinematography is not memorable, and the highly acclaimed 19th century Gothic atmosphere has just not attracted me. Several of the actors are quite good (especially the headmaster and the sadistic girl who rules the younger students), but the Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but incredible, they add very little spice or excitement. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
