As a single woman over 40, I found this movie extremely insulting and degrading for single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a tedious, pathetic attempt by a man to write and control a "chick flick," and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not much of an actress to begin with, but considering the non-existent "plot" (I hate myself to refer to it as a plot) here she hasn't had a chance. There was no sign development, no need to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the movie in any way realistic or credible. And then it is the mandatory male imagination of an attractive straight woman who suddenly decides to give lesbians a try - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only do I want me to get my money back to the DVD rental, I also want them back 112 minutes of my life. What a ripoff.
