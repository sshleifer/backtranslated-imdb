A physician attempting to complete the medical dream of transplantation secretly experiments similar to that of the hospital with varying degrees of success. His final best bet comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend in his jacket when he saves it from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese, and with this premise I thought I found it. It has everything bad movie hunters are looking for - breast and brain surgery with the surgeons, leaving with pristine white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always love to see the car's rear passenger wheels), cheesy clarinet stripping music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history . But unfortunately, these bad good good moments cannot overcome the too bad stinks. Jan in the Panen annoyed me with her queen monologues in a hoarse whispering it a little less than evil laughter and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian home-brewed coffee and 2 DD batteries. I couldn't even entertain myself with Dr. Bill's terrible overall and moral self-righteousness. Usually such a ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion, in this case I was sorry. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the 1960's version of "body shopping" and I myself found myself nodding over it. <br /> <br /> Don't spend money on this - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor.
