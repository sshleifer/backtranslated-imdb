We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has got his fingernails extracted. We weren't squeamish - we've been sitting through an hour of this drive we just knew what it felt. Saying that this movie was incomprehensible, dull, pretentious twaddle would be exaggerating it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseudo corner of a movie, or even nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked so sick we felt seeing him. What did he think? Oh .. and what was with these subtitles? - Did we just have a DVD DVD or was the original movie made - phrases that got stuck in the air? The film was hard enough to follow without it too. I apologize for the cast, which of course did its best with the available material.
