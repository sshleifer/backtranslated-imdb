This movie delivers. The best part is when the unpleasant teenage neighbor tries to ride away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he has never been anywhere near a bike in his life when he tries not to fall. <br /> <br /> But this movie doesn't stop there when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene without anything but an arm that goes through a fence and into a cooler that pulls out a beer. <br /> <br /> stereotypical grilling dads, multiple plot lines that go nowhere, and a former seaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to make this the perfect Saturday night at home.
