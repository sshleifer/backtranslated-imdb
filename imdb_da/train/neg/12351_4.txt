A recent speech by a woman claiming a military background contained the remark "A woman's life is no more valuable than a man". This mantra of the politically correct is not true as the story as well as the biology show. Society has managed to recover from the great loss of their male population, sometimes with amazing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the war of 1914-1918, where over two million of her men were killed. In South America's Triple Alliance War (1865), Paraguay took three neighboring countries until virtually all of its male population was wiped out but fought for a stalemate in the Chaco War in 1932 against much larger Bolivia. <br /> <br /> However, no society has or could never survive the loss of its female population. Only when the people's lives are at stake are women sent to battle. Israel is facing this situation in 1948, but since then, it has never considered coed combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is Hollywood fluff.
