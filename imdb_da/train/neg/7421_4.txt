Seeing beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most lovely guilty horror medium film lets me enjoy. So the house on Carroll Street was not a waste of time, even though the story is constructed and the manuscript is uninspired and somewhat annoying. There are many connections with various Hitchcock images, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the lead role. She is dressed up as Grace Kelly and she is not far from the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way she is introduced to the audience, she should be a person with political beliefs and a purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific problem. But history, in the first minutes, degenerates into a repugnant crime story with incredible coincidence, high predictability, and a set of two-dimensional characters. It is so much more regrettable as the actors' performances are good, like photography and set designs. <br /> <br /> The final in Central Station, New York, breathes. It starts in the underground section and then moves up to the roof. The film can be praised for its good use of the architecture.
