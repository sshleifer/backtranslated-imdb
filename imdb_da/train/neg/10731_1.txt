The film is basically the story of a Russian prostitute's return to her hometown for the burial of a sister / friend. There are a few other smaller story lines that can actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. The core of the film is the funeral, waking and later controversy about the future of a community of crowns making dolls and selling them to buy vodka, but now lack the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from town to village is an eerie endless train ride and trampling through the mud. Perhaps it should impress us with the immense landscape of the Russian landscape. The village itself is inhabited by a legion of widows and a man, the conscience of the dead girl. Continuing the puppetry business is problematic for everyone involved and appears to be impossible. Most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that could cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do not contain the songs and flaps in the crones. Do not go to this movie unless you are fluent in Russian.
