You have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55 years old by filming, but so close to 70, and he lived only 8 years. At one point, Holden said, "I'm over twice your age." Okay, try triple grandfather! The "old enough to be your father" theme they shoot for didn't work. Granted older citizens sometimes settle for legal teenagers. More power to them, but that doesn't mean I want to see it. It's not a question of judgment but the digestive trace. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch, and the 70's cars, clothes, furniture, etc. Make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you will see something to close in bed. It would have been great to see the blonde friend of Lenz, the one who hooked her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasantly spacious ... Who was this chick? I'll try to figure it out.
