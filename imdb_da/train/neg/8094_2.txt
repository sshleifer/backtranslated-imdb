As one who has both read the novel and seen the movie, I have another reason why the film was such a flop. First, any comparison between novel and film is superficial. They are two different animals. The novel is probably calculated as a satire, but it comes as a cross between tragedy and controversy instead. Any comic elements such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are just random for the author's uniform cynical presentation. And for the author's ubiquitous white dress to fool you into thinking it's another Mark Twain, think again. A more apt literary precedent would be Ambrose Bierce's ghost in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is just sharing clown and hack, more celebrity than writer, always looking for new grist to his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> It is, therefore, no wonder that the outstanding production competencies and directions that played the film's production were doomed from the start. Contrary to true satire, which translates very well into film, controversy is not due to universally available observations of some form of human behavior, but to a single-minded attack on certain people - whether true or fictional strangers - as somehow earned the wrath of the writer. Any effort to create a successful movie story or story from such a beginning must have a clean start, free from the author's influence or interference. <br /> <br /> That said, I also find fault with the molding. It's not just that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to gauge, but the real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either completely wasted or given roles that are merely caricatures. <br /> <br /> There is probably current material here for a really good movie satire, but it does not succeed to get right close.
