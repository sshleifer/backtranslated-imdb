Leave it to Paul "sex on the brain" Verhoeven to come up with a pointless, sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he were to lead a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would make it a massive body of organs. I don't care about sex or even sleaze (see my other reviews) on movies, but frankly it's obvious that the instructor has a trace of mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects of an invisible man's story than the kinky implications that follow with it . It's a shame because it could have been good if the movie didn't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon grope women. <br /> <br /> The play of actors does what it can with one note cheesy script, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here. <br /> <br /> But what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which btw is much more entertaining than this posed & bad movie.
