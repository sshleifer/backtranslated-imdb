See a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq counting their time before they can go home. It sounds boring in itself. Every time the little caption came up to tell us how long they had left, it just owed this movie without plot to draw on and again. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I need something missing. I'm a big fan of war movies if they're done well. This had a "jarhead" syndrome. A movie that was sometimes beautifully shot, but cinematography does not stop it from being completely boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> And came across the slow "cartridges" coming out of the gun "already shot. They could have saved money and just got stockings from any other movie with a gun in it. I had no empathy for the main guy in it, i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would make him die. In fact, the movie would have worked much better if he had. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and seemed to get that feeling That those who had been in armed forces did not like it, and everyone else loved it, I have never been to the forces and I am with them.
