The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to turn your head against the wall, allow some internal bleeding in the brain, let a lot of your brain cells die and when you are officially mentally delayed, maybe you * MEG * enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cabin driver, and it was also the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fell in love, it would have made it a much more enjoyable movie. The only reason I gave it a 3-rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. Plus the stage at Heathrow in re-union was just too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have shot himself a lot before he even reached the sky bridge to confess his true love :) But then again the meaning of the movie was to believe in logic, gravity, physics and throws an egg on the face of the * GENERAL * audience. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk. At least I know I've been scared for life: (
