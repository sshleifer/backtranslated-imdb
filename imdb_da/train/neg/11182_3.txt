Very silly movie, filled with stupid lines and Jewish references through. It was a serious movie, but could not be taken seriously. A well-known movie plot ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A terrible plot involving Kim Bassinger. Very robot and for the regiment. I have noticed that Al Pacino's working abilities seem to go downhill. A troubleshooting issue, but no more disturbing than Pacino's awful Atlanta accent. Damage control must remedy this damage to a movie. Ok my one liners are bad but not as bad as those in this movie. This film manages to be not only boring but also revolting. Normally, a revolting movie can be seen for the wrong reasons. This movie is not available. I managed to sit through this. The plot, if written a little better, with perhaps a little better acting and the elimination of the horrible subplot and even stupid jokes, could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums. What we are back with is a dull, silly movie that made it drilled in our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish. An embarrassment to all the good Jewish peoples everywhere.
