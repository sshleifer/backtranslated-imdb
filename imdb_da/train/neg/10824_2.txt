This version is rather unwieldy, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's tired throwaway recording style is completely unsuitable for Edward Rochester's daring passion and bad Charlotte Gainsbrough resembles a dull, scary teenager whose tooth braces are hurting! Nor can I believe that they eliminated Edwards great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in the literature. I appreciate that they finally used such a young, ordinary woman to play Jane, a sign that should be a secular 18, but if you want to see a version approaching the novel's personalities and passions, you can see 70's version with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and beautiful to play Jane, but no one has touched Rochester's character as Scott did.
