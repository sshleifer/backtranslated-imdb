Slackers with the title of this movie are three university friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel). They have to go to university without going through an honest exam, but make it a success. This continues until the end when it is not odd, but Nathan (Schwartzman's most pleasant character) shows what they are capable of. Nathan starts harassment to deal with his dream girl, as he cannot pursue it under normal circumstances. The only problem is when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and kindhearted Angela (James King). Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant movie. Schwartzman makes the film easy to see, as his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired to be with her beautiful appearance. Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Witnesses are as low as American cake. But aren't they all used? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they run out of originality. Overall, a few smiley moments but a horrible movie about shopping (except Schwartzman) and subject. * out of *****
