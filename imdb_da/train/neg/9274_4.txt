This sequel is a total rehash of the first movie. A completely meaningless movie. It just took just about every sceanrio of the first movie, and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time. It even ends in the same way as the first! The music is too busy and interfering, and because it is pretty much a copy of Omen I, it is very predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly made, there are much worse movies out there, it just didn't make any sense to be made. The omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more meaningless than this, so I think so. If you someone pointed a gun upside down and you had to choose to see this sequel or 2006 ream, I guess I would choose this.
