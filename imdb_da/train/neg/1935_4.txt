Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely redundant sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The film delivers the spell-shaped special effects one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely stupid caricatures. You still need to be in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely fun. The reason is predictable, and the development is sometimes irregular and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to look like old Godzilla movies, including shabby greater than longevity effects and a (good yet another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have laughed if I had expected camp. It is amazing to see what trash can fantasy fans have to deal with - in this case, because someone thought they could squeeze some extra money out of a successful formula. They won't be able to do it again: the cash queue is now dead as a dodo.
