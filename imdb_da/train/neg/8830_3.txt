Just too many gaps in this movie are enjoyable and worthy of all a bizarre, almost Hollywood-like ending that is totally out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You must also be thick-skinned on all kinds of politically correct undertones. The conflict between white and black was strongly constructed and one-sided. I did not understand why the author had the local black community behave in such an unacceptable way is he / she trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A really bizarre movie. Just look at whether you like to be very annoyed by gaps in the plot and would like to discuss all the things that might or may not have happened. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, the film and the recording are excellent.
