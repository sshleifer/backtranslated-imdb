I am the kind of person who went down to the local library and read books about Babbage's difference engine, while my schoolmates played football, etc. So if there is something like the target audience for this movie, then I think I'm probably in it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll just see it again. A previous reviewer did not mention watching this movie while he was tired. Maybe it was my fault. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this movie, and there are aspects of what I like, but generally I found it amateurish and completely plodding. <br /> <br /> Being something of a self-conscious computer geek, I just can't help getting the exact time frame when the movie was actually made and how the graphics used reflect that time (ie, 1997). After playing e-time games c.f. "Mind Grind" to name an example, this movie cannot escape the 16-bit color low res multimedia explosion of that time. Now, fortunately, it has been somewhat smaller in recent years in the gaming world at least in favor of the actual game. <br /> <br /> Having to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel (which I don't 'I think has ever been broadcast on UK FTA TV, not recently anyway), I became mild amused to see the final credit note Gottdog (Good dog) had 4 people working with that design. Perhaps it makes sense for me to be entertained by this, as ten years have passed since the film was made, yet the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties good for comparison. <br /> <br /> But as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a movie without the sci-fi angle, and a more straightforward biographical approach might be better suited to cover the life story of this remarkable lady. There is a fundamental mistake to undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First and foremost, the underlying idea that somehow lost information from the past from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some form of extrapolation through software-based intelligent agents, somehow seem ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Also, the theme runs through movies that a computer unit can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (eg, the winds) are now known for not being. <br /> <br /> OK, so the Victorians may have had this view, but the 20th-century GÃ¶del work shows that no mathematical system can be complete. Touring works with limits on computability, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, have completely undermined these ideas, which are central to how the modern researcher's software must work. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking the mouse in the air means "programming" is also just wrong, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie might have been ok but at least some technical a scientific consultation would have given the film some needed credit in believability stakes. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the movie though, like "Pi", it is clearly a unique work but also many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 from me.
