Yet the same famous story of a man (author here) who sells his soul to the devil for his most desired ambition in life: success. Unfunny script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" "Christmanish" message (our only wish in life is to find love, respect, and good friendship) and a very long trial scene At the end, when the agent Hopkins struck the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not at all sexy or evil) for all the bad things she did on this unlikely character. Not bad action from the actors (Baldwin also as director, Cattrall in a "Sex and the City" role again, Aykroyd with some fun lines in his limited role). P. S. Also try a not so popular movie from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man gives his soul to the devil to come back to his youth)
