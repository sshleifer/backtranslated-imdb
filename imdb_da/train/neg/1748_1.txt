Don't waste your time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, steering, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors. The movie is not right for Paresh Rawal, who may be one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also an advancing star, did a pretty bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I think he should thank God for having a beautiful face otherwise he would win Razzie awards in India if there were such prizes in Bollywood. Asrani is a great talent, but dodges his bit as before. Plays that were not to mention a rip-off from the 1965 Boeing Boeing were pretty badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood just can't do something original. In addition, they do not even know how to copy well. The wit in the movie was so overdone, it was painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. Sound editing is incredibly crazy. I can go further and in this case, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be shameful in making such a movie. The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What's wrong with you? This is why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood produces more movies than Hollywood every year, but most of the movies are unheard of abroad because of films like this. I'm an Native American and I'm totally disgraceful for Bollywood to produce this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just amazing. They are world-class movies that are timeless ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala is perhaps one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 out of 10.
