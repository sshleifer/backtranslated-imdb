This version moved a little slowly to my taste, and I assume I have problems with this game at first. But first the movie is a typical TV movie version of a game, which means it doesn't have the flair in the original movie version with William Holden. What they could not afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the movie until 1966? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam War protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the casting, some hits are hit by some. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand misses many notes. He is credible as an ex-BMOC jock, but he does not have the healthy sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla to get all the women in town to aab over him (excuse the pun). Gretchen Moll was lovely, but she seemed a little too clever for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the signs were supposed to be. But again, Holden was ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was pretty forgettable when the mother and Mary Steenburgen couldn't seem to make up for her if she played Blanche duBois or Katharine from "The Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge's play, I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choose passion for practical needs always need an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone" I believe gives a probable epilogue with the episode "Spur of the Moment", where a young Diana Hyland was chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland, because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy looks like Hal Carter.
