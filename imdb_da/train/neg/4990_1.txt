I can enjoy a guilty vigilante flick, but it's just bad. And not bad in a way you like to see MST3K make fun of it. It's just uncomfortably bad, as if you can't find anything to enjoy about it, no matter how hard you try. I'm really sorry to waste 2 hours of valuable life on this crap. You can tell by watching that no one was asked to act, and everyone in it knew that this movie would only limit their career. Apparently "Walking Tall" has earned enough income that someone decided they could make a buck of their investment. If it's not the worst movie I've seen, it's so bad that it's deleted the worse movies from my memory.
