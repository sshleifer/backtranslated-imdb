1980s television show, updated with fresh female meat and raunchy language. "Hazzard's Dukes" passed me; it was not repeated every time I was in front of the television in either New York or California; or would I probably have seen. Still, from somewhere (like the clips that come with this movie's updated release in 2005), I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and "General Lee" is still good to go. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her skimpy short well - but even her waking pink bikini can't beat the competition from a dormitory full of jumping topless coeds. The all too stupid plot involves a greedy Burt Reynolds (like "Boss" Hogg) who threatens to transform Hazzard County into a strip. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
