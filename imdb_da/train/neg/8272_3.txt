At the end of "Dragon Heat" everything I could think of was why I was bothered to sit through it all. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is interesting and that - as well as Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the movie in the first place. But I was ever disappointed. Writer Director Daniel Lee can't hold a light like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the most annoyingly directed movies I've ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use this phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the movie with completely unnecessary black-and-white stills, freeze frames, slow motion, fast motion, and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did everything to compensate for the lack of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and play like some jumping music videos more than anything else. There is little to do with any of the characters - including two presumably professional snipers who couldn't hit the width of a barn from within! - who is then loaded with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The ground is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set-up everything is predictable - and Lee feels the need to remind the story of the characters if we didn't get it first several times. This is terribly amateurish writing and filmmaking, wasting the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although I am honestly pressured, I am hard-pressed to remember that Biehn is in a good movie that was not ruled by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a great Hong Kong player, you're much better off with some of the staples - John Woo's "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" (1992) , Ringo Lamb's "City on Fire" (1987) - as Quentin Tarantino stole for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his "Point Blank" (1967) remake, "Full Contact" (1992). Or even check out Yuen's "So Close" (2002), a highly entertaining yet preposterous popcorn flick. And there is always the terrible French police officer, "The Nest" (2002). True, most, if not all, are a little over-the-top, but they were movies that remain exciting, exciting and even exciting. They have characters that we care about and mind-blowing action sequences. <br /> <br /> The "Dragon Heat" on the other hand is just terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee has not made a bad action movie, he has made a boring one.
