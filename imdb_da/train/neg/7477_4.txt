Very close-motion movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (though he really does broadcast his performance in Fawlty Towers). Seems to flip over the top slapstick for slushy sentimentality at the drop of a hat, and the worst part of the movie is that Martin and Hawn must "find themselves" who they are, etc. Look at your danger.
