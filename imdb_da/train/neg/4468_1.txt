OK, simple and simple, if you're a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), stay away from LEGEND. It is undoubtedly the most disappointing TR game yet. It looks really good, it sounds very good, but it is completely irreversible and I have given up. I want to have been robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, the controls were standard. In AOD, they were "sticky", but still the same general control sequences. In Legend, they have completely changed their movement and control method, and she is completely uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'use the mouse'. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a gamepad'. No, why should I? Others say "But it has been the standard for 3rd person control for years." It doesn't care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why shake it. Oh, I know because they couldn't care less about their original loyal fan base they want to redeem on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series before the movies came out and make more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious TR fan is away from this game and if you buy it, you complain to Eidos. I've seen lots of other posts, mostly on Eido's forums, from people who tell them how rubbish it is, maybe they'll listen.
