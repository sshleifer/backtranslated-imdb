Looking at this movie? I thought of myself what a lot of garbage. These girls must have stones for brains to agree on themselves to be part of it. Wasting time watching it, weak skies I have only hired it. The play was below standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone considering watching this movie, save your money. The movie has no credit at all. I'm a real movie cuff and it's worse than "Attack of the Green Tomatoes". I only hope that this piece of waste does not cost too much to make. Money would have been better spent on the homeless in the world. I just hope there is no successor in the tube.
