If they could get Ed Asner, why didn't they get other actors instead of people going to the same church as the producers? And why the protagonist threw the clever old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger. It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride, and the young guy would then feel guilty and leave him with a lifelong disability. So I guess why the protagonist refuses money himself and why the old guy works like a dog, even when he volunteers for extra work. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is distant, why is a soldier better. He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father. All the characters to be considered sympathetic are not, and everyone else is the 'bad' girlfriend. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a sawmill?
