Margret Laurence had no intention of having any of her novels adopted for film, let alone Stone Angel. Hagar was like a character who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay, who dares, somebody?) And almost ended up sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc. Etc.) are constant reminders of the old and the new battle, and the bloodbath (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> While the movie is reasonably true to the book's plot (but it's not really a plot of storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit of the movie. Hagar's reluctance (for the sake of patience) was not there. Bram could have been much more raw than portrayed, and Hagar's father could have been played more "traditionally", so to speak. If the filmmaker wanted to insist on stronger depictions, the movie would run the point straight to the home. <br /> <br /> Similarly, why should we see mobile phones, organic products and other modernizations? We try to make some points to get some points (for example, the Muslim girlfriend and the natives). Hagar and co. is anything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see it in the movie version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low budget operation, but using it as an excuse to send subliminal politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and the movie) seems to throw away the intellect. <br /> There is also the audience. It seems that we have been conditional on seeing bitter old people as sweet and lovable. Why should laugh every time Hagar is on her tantrum? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of anxiety, and all we do is laugh at them. I don't think that made Hagar and other people in their situation any justice.
