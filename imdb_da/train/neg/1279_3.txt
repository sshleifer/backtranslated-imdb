Three stories are told in this movie, which seemed to have been shot without knowledge that this is a combined vignette film. The authors relate the three vignettes by having all of them associated with shrinking Martin Kove, even if you never see any of the leaders with Kove. The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman afraid of everything under the sun (she makes Adrian Monk look brave), has a paranoia lace evening at home alone. You will literally scream at Vivian to make some ridiculous things. She spends most of her time in a nighty, showing her amazing features. But her movie is the worst, if not the most nail-biting. <br /> <br /> The other vignette is owned by Bill Paxton, whom he portrays the room from hell. His geeky roommate allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does so when he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was fun as a man fears that death will take him at all times, just like his friend choked to death on an olive. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, as the film as a whole seems to be cut along with very little thought involved. A must for Bill Paxton fans.
