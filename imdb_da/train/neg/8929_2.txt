This hodge-podge adapted to a Gore Vidal novel (actually one of the great American writers) makes MAGIC CHRIST and the VALLEY OF DOLLS resemble Fellini works of art. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and she is actually not very tall) in a leading role (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER, when she was quite good) plays Rex Reed's (poorly film-reviewing, not critic) alter-ego, to be surrounded only with dragon queen Mae West, horny John Huston, a young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (before Lee Majors; what a shame) and other various manger azoids like to spoof WAY ​​too, things can't do anything for it except interleaved old movie clips (ie Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... just so they can continue to bleed their lives out of everyone. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Best Performance = ?. It's so bad it's worth seeing!
