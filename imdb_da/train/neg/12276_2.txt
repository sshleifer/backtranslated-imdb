The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately it was separated due to a weak / inappropriate line of story, miscasting and general lack of content / substance. One of the very obvious mistakes was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, didn't know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem a small mistake, but it points to the apparent lack of effort by paying attention to details. The quality of the action was uniformly far below average. <br /> <br /> The movie's lonely saving grace was twisted in the plot at the end; and a French song (I can't remember the title). Overall, it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast.
