Ridiculous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems to attract Amidala, 5 years old his senior. Now, 22-year-old Jedi war hero Annakin is a couple of bad dreams, and it also takes to slaughter children, his friends and all his life frame because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife can really die, and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think the people who like this movie are not aware. The story is ridiculous. The signs are incredible (literally, not the perverted sense of "amazing", "wonderful", etc.). Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and friendly anchor of the whole series, but in Climax, he chops Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava and leaves him to suffer. Don't anyone think it's a little out of character? Not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance for him as it turns out. <br /> <br /> At least I expected a story that showed consistent signs of probable motivation. None of this. The story could have been written by a 10 year old. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, CGI is pretty cool.
