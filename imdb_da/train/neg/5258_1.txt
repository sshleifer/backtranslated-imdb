Well, I rented this movie and found out that it was really sugar. It's about the family with the pin and the same stupid games in the family, then the cool son comes with his stupid camera, and he likes to take a picture for damaged building and weird things and weird movies, and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agree on etc etc ... They go to the city that no one knows it exists (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you do not Understand what is the movie I have seen many mystery movies, but it was the worst, honestly, it has no description at all, and I wish I did not see it.
