I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror movies to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad "horror" movie. Don't waste your time or money on this movie, the play is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've encountered, and the script was just awful. Nothing about it was good, you end up thinking about yourself, why do I see this shit. The plot had so many holes in it, and they were never cleared at last, it was just so bad, I don't know how a movie could be so awfully made. As I said before, I love horror movies, and I was so disappointed, it was an 18, but you see some blood and no scary or jumping at all. Also, what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the movie, which had no meaning whatsoever about the plot that brother and sister kissed, why? is all I can say. Just don't bother, there are far more good horror movies out there, just don't waste your time, life is too short.
