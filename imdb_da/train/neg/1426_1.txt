One question: Why? First, the premise is not fun or engaging at all. They use taped interviews and take the sound to animate it with animals that talk about the parts. First, the interviews are not fun or entertaining at first, and even though they were, I am sure they would be much more entertaining to be considered as originally without being converted into cartoons. How does it add any hilarity to it? I hit the CBS Monday night sitcom line-up (which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday workdays) and found this on. Of course, the sitcom line-up would be disagreeable as in the summer, but seeing these episodes again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I figured it might be fun. Nix. And then it continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a purpose if the interviews were shown in their entirety and had points to them. But no, it was just a one-line clip, cut and glued together really fast. It was like a horrible horrible version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken." I was not a fan of CBS 'now-canceled sitcom "The Class." Where it was, it was half an hour of line-up I would struggle through. But if it came down to me to decide a whole season of it or three more episodes of "Creatures" .... let's just say I would take the "Class". Considering that it has been a few hours since it aired and I come here to see, I am the first to comment ... I think this is a good sign that no one saw it and that it is not lasts longer. Cartoon roadkill.
