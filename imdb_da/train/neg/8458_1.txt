I bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Terrible mistake. The box sounds like it would be a really good movie. Now it begins as if it is this amazing movie. In approx. 5 minutes it is. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who is killed to save her beau, Jack, from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a ranch that cities are afraid of. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was allegedly afraid of this bull and continues to find this hunt to find him. It was the first 5 minutes that are good. What follows is only getting worse 100 times. Anyone who wrote the scripture, in my opinion, should have been on a kind of sour trip or something, because nothing else made any sense what ever. Jack is on the run and finds this travel radio DJ named Mary, who gives him a ride. I think Mary should be a virgin Mary character. You know, Jesus' mother. But who knows, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. As they run ... we see evil guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc. And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts trying to figure out what's happening. Needless to say, I took the film back and exchanged it for something else. It's terrible, I'm telling you, horrible. And there is absolutely no bullfight in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. Hope I have helped some other people avoid wasting their time on this movie.
