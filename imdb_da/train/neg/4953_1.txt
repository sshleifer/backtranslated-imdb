I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel like I should see the Batman animation. Its absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell are they trying to mess with the winning formula? I want to write a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and brooding, just as Batman was meant to be. WB had to destroy this with some tripe Batman of the Future. Now they produce this drift. The joker does not resemble Joker remotely from DC comics. DC should sue. I encourage anyone who agrees with me to email or write to the WB and use the power of the people to get back to the original formula
