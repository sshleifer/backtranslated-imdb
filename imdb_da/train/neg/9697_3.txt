I've seen the first of the dwarf films, and sometimes I had a little fun watching it. There are many famous TV / comedy actors that appear in the first part and are presented in fantasy costumes, typical small episodes of their Stand-Up Program, and that's precisely the problem the other movie has to fight with. Everything was already there .... nothing new to achieve. You are familiar with most of the often dull and stupid "jokes", and you always want their goal to put in all the Comedians in the last decade wanting to get back on stage. There is nothing important about history: typical fairy tale story about Rumpelstiltskin without significance. I was expecting something like that, but nothing I could complain about. In fact, I complain about the lazy story writers who had a whole background story; their only business was getting many jokes and parodies inside, but they didn't get it anyway. This crap, apart from the beautiful look of Helge Schneider, is a total waste of time and money. (If you don't like him, then remove 2 points in my evaluation) If you like to save money and get bad jokes, check out what is widely cast every Friday night at SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you will recognize some "laugthers" I saw last night at the cinema.
