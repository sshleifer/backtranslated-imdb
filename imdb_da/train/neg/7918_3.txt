I found the writing in this movie horrible. The only thing that saved this movie from me classified it as a 1 out of 10, was Lacy Chabert's performance as I thought the many personalities played really well. For me, she was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was beautiful as always, but I found her role pretty bland, so I don't think you can say her acting was amazing. <Br /> <br/> As far as the male leader, Armand Assante, is concerned, he recalled his interpretation of the role primarily of doctors in the cheese series 1980s hospital series. Everything I could have lived with. But the horrible, horrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psychic and even the psychic role were just some of the worst writings I've seen for a long time.
