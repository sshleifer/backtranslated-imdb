But it has some good actions and a plot that is something interesting. Nevsky acts as an organ builder, and he is not so attractive, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. (His action skills lack everything!) Sascha is very well played by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she got and she had to develop her character. There are far too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action and too stupid for an end. It's very violent. However, I loved nature, this movie takes you all over the world and it's a bonus. I also liked how it had some things about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. The actors should be more beautiful ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be warm enough, but for us ladies who are fans of action, Nevsky doesn't just cut it off. Overall, this movie was fine, I didn't love it either, I hated it, just found it to be another normal action flick.
