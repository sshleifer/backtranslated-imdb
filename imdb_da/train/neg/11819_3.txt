Despite that, I unfortunately seem to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately, this movie is over mercifully fast. The script makes no sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is weird, and John Lydon shows us all, within a movie, why he should never have gone out of music. His performance is unanimous and annoying. The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel is able to deliver a good trip. His later bad lieutenant would show how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance is maintained here.
