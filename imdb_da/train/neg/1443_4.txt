Begin with the good bit: Swayze speaks Zulu several times to his friends, or the language heard among the tribes. It's a good plus, as usually, the US and UK movie audiences think that all people on this planet speak English (just if you're one of them: no they don't). <br /> <br /> But the actor is 'ten-crown' as we say in Holland (it makes the toes curly and not in a good way). I like Swayze, but here he is horrible. The muscles in his jaws do overtime, and he cheats the whole movie, as one must have told him it looks great. No Patrick: It looks stupid and is compensation for missing character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has chosen a style of acting that does not meet the style of her colleagues. Her plays are so relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days. And that's not it. Your dress was a little, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best spectacle came from the people of the African continent and sided Onyulo as Umbopa, I liked the best. Clear, warm and character, his performance is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> General: It is mwah entertaining on a rainy day. Pity. Could have been better. Sacking the director.
