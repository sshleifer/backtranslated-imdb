Having seen about half of this movie I noticed something peculiar ... I found myself constantly changing through TV channels to see what's more - not even a good movie feature. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed as being in a series of genres, and I have to say it mostly failed in each of them. 80% through the movie I switched over to see an old genre instead. The bottom line - the whole movie felt as if those who did it did not know exactly what to do and ended up in a cook with no distinct taste.
