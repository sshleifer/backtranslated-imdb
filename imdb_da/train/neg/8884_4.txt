"Dominique" is one of the films for which the term "slow-as-molasses" has been invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see Robertson slow down the stairs because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is almost redeemed at the end of a surprising twist, which unfortunately is followed by another twist that only succeeds in leaving a bad taste in our mouth. Not a very enjoyable movie.
