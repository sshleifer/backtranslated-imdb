I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the castlist, but after I looked at it, I must admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this movie is that the actors are not able to keep this film on their backs. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are trying very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too common. So for Matt Dillon fans, this is a movie, as for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but it's not movie for him; far below his level. So, if you get busy with this great cast, watch it, but don't expect anything great or extraordinary. The only thing you can remember about this flick is the Diane Lane scenes; The rest of it is very forgettable.
