Payback is the game played in this drama, and the revenge plot is the oppression of the absurd story line that sets the stage for fireworks that come later. Why would a man get involved with the trophy wife for a ruthless mob in the gangster's own mansion with suspicious henchmen around? Why would an unhappy woman encourage an entire stranger's attention and expect him to carry her away with him and leave his husband and boredom behind to live happily ever with his new love? Certainly the dude, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold man who gives the film an excuse to indulge in meaningless doing and violence. Anthony Quinn, great actor that he was, probably deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers a lot as she locks to her prince's charming. Stowe is okay, but her Spanish accent does not work. The comedies of the smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland are interesting as a fading rock star.
