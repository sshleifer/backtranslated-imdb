I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on reusing bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. While this remake was not a total waste, I would still wish I had the six bucks back to go against a DVD of the original. Lots of violence and one of the worst closures I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It only repeats why Hollywood should leave the good things alone.
