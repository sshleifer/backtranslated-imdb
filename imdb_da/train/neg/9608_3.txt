Man, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly, where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the movie: A woman writhing naked in a circle of fire that turns into a werewolf. And this is no Rick Baker's American werewolf transformation, people. We are talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here. I can only imagine that some stony Italian spreads on naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the film's protagonist (is it a word?)) And ask her to roll in fur. It's so bad it is. <br /> <br /> It doesn't get much better from here. Minutes are wasted as the scene chews male actors waffle on Daniela and her state or something (I can't remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at what you're crying for). <br /> <The funny thing is Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a psycho who goes mentally when there is a man around (understandable when she was raped as a child), so she thinks she will be a werewolf as her ancestor opening scene). She can't help tearing in the throat of any man she meets, and she'll just be loved! Things begin to look for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a stuntman who does not trigger his episodes. Check out the montage here, one of the cheesiest you will ever see (laughs and cuddles after diving the first time through a window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's happiness doesn't stop when the movie takes a brutal turn, she's suddenly maliciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs killing the stuntman. Reminder of "I spit on your grave" extracts Daniela's bloody revenge on her rapes. <br /> <br /> This is 100 minutes in my life, I will never come back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a movie geek.
