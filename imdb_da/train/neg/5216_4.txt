'Metamoprhis' is the story of a burgeoning young scientist, honored at the local college, being examined by financial providers at the college. This forces him to take shortcuts in typical melodramatic melodramatic fashion. <br /> <br /> My first thought after this movie conclusion was this. "Not good, but not bad, too early to mid-eighties." Of course, I understood that it was made in 1990, which almost drove it down to a '4', but decided to keep it on the mediocre '5' as it is. <br /> <br /> On some occasions 'Metamorphis' seems like a good movie that is desperately trying to get out. The actor, while not star, is mostly competent. You can even see the occasional brilliance of a modest quality. Pacing is a big problem with the movie. After thinking I had seen for ninety minutes, I realized that I had only seen one hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around the weakness. <br /> <br /> The management, a mildly charismatic man who seems to try to mix the channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves reminded me most of Matt Dillon's character in the 'Wild Things'. The female heroine does an OK job, but does not distinguish in anyway. There is a "naughty girl" role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn't seem like much. There is a child's actor that the director cannot decide whether he is morose, cheerful or just weird. <br /> <br /> Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie until a final battle with the bad guy who would make a Power Ranger blush. It is bizarre and inexplicable until the final scene has to be dramatic, but simply fun, saturated with every bad camera trick and overactive that can be compressed in about 30 seconds. A decent sometime look at 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing will bring you back and nothing to buy on your own.
