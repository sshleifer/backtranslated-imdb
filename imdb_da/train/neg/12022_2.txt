The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, the performance lets it down. <br /> <br /> The movie lacks pace, for one thing. It must be an exciting trip, but it is slow and more than a little boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the manuscript and editing. There are not enough obstacles and conversions to blast excitement, and there are scenes that don't really move the story together very effectively. Producers should have seen this in the manuscript and insisted on a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also a writer and director, it will obviously not happen. Many of the actors seem to be flat and it is down to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects. It is a shame because with a better writing, editing and direction it could have been a really good thriller.
