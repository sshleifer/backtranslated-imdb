This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it makes an exciting and convincing argument that the story of Jesus, which is commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, the film changes completely after the gear, and it becomes a little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and largely focuses on the light targets. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the author / instructor has some problems with the church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this movie seems to be his form of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes extended, but overall, the film is disappointing.
