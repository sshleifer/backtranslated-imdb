What an absolute pile of pants. After reading Chris Brookmyres books religiously since I came across "Totally Ugly ..." I was happy to find out that this drama had been ordered. Of course I had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't quite fit. How anyone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The whole characters change, situations are drained, and to see Parlablanes dramatic break-in is reduced to Nesbitt making a quick tick and sliding open a carnival window ... it brought tears to my eyes. I fear to think about what will happen to "Country Of The Blind" if this is the benchmark ... <br /> <br /> Just avoid it ...
