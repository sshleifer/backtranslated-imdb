Well, here we have another role of reverse film. There were many worth seeing despite the tired plot of gender fluctuation. But this is not it. In earlier reviews, I think I have made my point about the general decline in enjoyment for Haim movies that followed in the late 80s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Just one of the girls' is about a high school kid (Corey Haim) trying to avoid her mobs by dressing up as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading team and makes friends with fellow cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Of course, he can't stop charade for much longer. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was completely crap and it wasn't even fun. But judging by a majority of reviews, it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would like to see this. If you're looking for a good Haim function (or role-changing comedy), look no further than 1989. It's about the point that Haim's career was thinking.
