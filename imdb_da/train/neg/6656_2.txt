This gets a two because I liked it as a child, but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it ... I can't give this a descriptive review because it would convert one thing to another, would I probably don't. It doesn't say anything that everyone else didn't already say. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this show is that it's pretty ugly, with the baby boiling to the twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and in it. I have a cousin who loves this show and he is the strangest and stupid person I've met. This show must be pulled from the air. It's always the same again and again ... They'll put better shows on Nick. I really get really tired of things like this.
