This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's great to laugh at. The dialogue can be incredibly ridiculous and badly acted (eg "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Safe." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any matches are more or less surreal . Be sure to look at Brock, the white white guy who is attacking the protagonists. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best men in the movie!
