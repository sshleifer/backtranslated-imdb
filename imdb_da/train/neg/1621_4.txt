'The Fox and the Child' is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary 'March of the Penguins.' It focuses on a young girl (wonderfully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her thriving friendship with a fox. There are some really fascinating moments here; badgers mucking about, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-filled forest; A scene in particular, when the fox is plagued by a pack of wolves, is quite intense and even frightening at times. But there are simply not quite enough of them. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; The kinematics are dazzling. The bubbling kind of look of the movie is wonderful. It is unthinkable a very lush production. The English version is told by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue that is already has been very badly baptized. The point is also too fluffy, or at least it is to my taste; and the manuscript, while weird, seems to change from one scenario to another, which ultimately gives me almost confused. <br /> <br /> While there is a good morale in the heart of the movie, and the pretty calm performance of Noël-Bruneau is absolutely wonderful, the real star is the fox. The captivating moments that focus exclusively on our frantic little friend are huge. But again, there are simply not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Remember to visit www.mybluray to keep up with the latest in movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more. com.au
