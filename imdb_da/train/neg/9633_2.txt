Is the rich, failing Elizabeth Taylor directing the angel of death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just over-reacting - or more precisely overactive - as usual? In fact, both are usable in director Joseph Losey's wandering meandering rod called "Boom", which is duly designated as temperatures in the lush, luxurious setting are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain uninvited; She dresses him in a samurai's robe complete with saber. Even though it is beautiful in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a mistake, even though Liz 'n Dick philes should disappear (stellar collective "what the hell!" Attitude to their late 60s movie career reached an ego-gal nadir here ). Meaningless, confused and annoying, "Boom" is a disaster - even though the scriptwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own failed piece "The Milk Tree Doesn't Stop Again", is said to be very happy about it! * from ****
