Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in spacious costumes. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci fi, I even love cheesy 50s sci fi, but this movie is really, really bad. And not in a MST3K way. <br /> <br /> Almost uatches like a pair of bozos make their best "hip cat" impression of Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi, as in "Cat Women On the Moon", but it cannot. This movie requires a mute button and fast forward function. <br /> <br /> That said, I could see Gloria and Dolores walking around the spacecraft for about an hour or so.
