Tarzan The Ape Man is a remake of 1932 movies from the same time, and the previous film has it similar to Burrough's literary character. But while Tarzan in 1932 was reduced to "Tarzan-Jane" speech, this Tarzan, which is played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak or even shallow. He does the Tarzan scream a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled from the previous movie. No, Tarzan plays the second course to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather as the third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no meaning but to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the movie are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Bizarre, Tarzan has an orangutan side scoop in this movie. Maybe he assembles a car from Sumatra with the Indian elephants who are also on show.
