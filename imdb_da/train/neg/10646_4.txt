Last of Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan films and also a good thing, as it is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years. No mermaids are here as well, as a beautiful lady tries to escape her folk clubs who worship a god and try to force her to be her bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane who are trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially shabby high priest, but is not used to his full advantage. Also on hand and worth mentioning is a very annoying guitarist / singer who goes so often in song. Even the "big" Robert Florey can't help this one. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
