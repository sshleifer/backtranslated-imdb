San Francisco is a big city with big-acting credits. In this one, the filmmakers did not try to use the city. They did not even make the most of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You won't think "Oh, I've been there," you want to think "How did a two-story four-step / smelly armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of the leaders used East Coast speech styles and influences. It diminishes, but the play was always competent. The stories seemed to be shot in three different styles, at least in the beginning. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, torn scene for stage from stylish action movies from Hong Kong. The originals had much more excitement and emotional resonance, they were framed and the pace improved. But the play is fun and we get to see James Hong and other fixtures. <br /> <br /> The white boy's intro was meaningless. I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it down. The father is a strange attempt at a Berkeley liberal - really people, everyone knows it's not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are most humorous. They threw away some good opportunities. Trained and embarrassed on the west coast, a yuppie jerk here is another kind of yuppie jerk than they do in New York. They are equally unacceptable, but always distinguishable. It would have been interesting; It wasn't. <br /> <br /> Hunters Point Intro was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco. You've seen it done before, and you've seen it done better. Even video games were better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-urban and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting begins to force themselves around in the clumsy direction ... about. ten minutes before the end. Good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a lack of minority here, see if you can guess which one.
