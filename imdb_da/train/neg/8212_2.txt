I've read all the comments on this movie. I am a great admirer <br /> <br /> of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this <br /> <br /> movie was based. The film is an ugly and degrading fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize for <br /> <br /> changing small details or events for dramatic purposes; it is <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the effect, the reaction, <br /> <br /> the realities and changes in each protagonist. It changes a lot <br /> <br /> the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry of a Tibetan woman (like the demean's <br /> <br /> Tibet's culture) to Harra's music box gift to Harrer's <br /> <br /> change of heart, all about This movie is fake - except <br /> <br /> for the amazing photograph. I understand that the shot of <br /> <br /> Potala (the castle) was smuggled out of Tibet. But <br /> <br /> changing a real story about the relationship between two people, one of them very important to this world to build a <br /> <br /> movie star is sad
