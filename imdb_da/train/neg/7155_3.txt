I'm sorry, but I didn't like this document very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who have done that, of course, don't have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and no real insight is given. The recordings are also not collected in a very informative way. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I want to say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. Everyone considered, this only gets a '4.'
