Yep, lots of shouting, screaming, cheering, arguing, celebrating, fisting, hovering and fighting. You have a general idea of ​​why, but can never be 100% safe. A fleet knowledge would benefit the finer points, but then you would probably spot the many errors. Not a horrible movie & Hackman & Washington are their usual brilliant, but the plot was one you could get pretty early on. I'm still waiting to see a submarine movie where people get started with each other and don't argue, but then you probably won't have a movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
