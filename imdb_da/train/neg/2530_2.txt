This movie was scary. and not in the good way some have claimed. First, the protagonist is a very uninteresting giant. Second - WTF is with this van love. The reason is basically: boy wants sex, so buys a van (which in fairness is quite cool). Incredible considering he looks like a newt, he scores with many chickens! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot chick and realizes that he loves this dowdy bird who has difficulty getting. Then he pulls races with the hot chickens girlfriend. And he speaks his van. At what time, danny devito forms the day. Although he did not need it, he tipped the bucket of the ginger child first across the line. I gave this 2 * s, which I am willing to assume there is a kind of 70's watering subculture, I don't get, and also because there are 70's wrestling.
