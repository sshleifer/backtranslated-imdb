All that happened to Keaton is what I want to know. <br /> <br /> In fact, I don't crawl away, raise, and thought she should blame half the bookies in Vegas, or maybe not, maybe she was just brainwashed, harassed, and bored to death. Rich enough to adopt a third country, she had to somehow steal in another cookie cut, clich√©-ridden drool'athon, based on the same character franchise she has rehashed since the "Brides father" ('91) . You think she's going head to head with Mr.Bean. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers) <br /> So, hubby (Dax) gets fired by the uncomfortable son of the boss, his mother (Keaton) leaves his father after the classic row and crashes with his own dog show in tow, the little rascals. Her hubby has cold feet for bleeding, wife's watch a-ticking and hi, let's throw in a space caddy as second house guest for good, all in one day, because it's so fun and original. Wife gets tired and goes away, mother leaves dad to the room cadet and the couple makes time to close credits, 86 very long minutes later. <br /> <br /> Now, if you need a room caddy, he can't fall, he can't count on any excuse for his stayover, and if mom leaves dad, she can't jump into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some screenwriters agonized over how to cheer things up. <br /> <br /> Plus, gag, inviting her to only discover that she has been dog feeding in the cab, must now be banned. And you only get an unpleasant 2-dimensional boss to break down. Another movie killer would be the movie script on which the space caddy strikes, apparently more limp than the actual, again, dejas-ad nausea. Liv Tyler doesn't seem to be happy here, her voice was sometimes fun, it had me wondered if they later had her redub some of it, and she's a smart one, she handled great roles, and we forgive her to Jersey Girl, it was disastrous, could happen to everyone. Dax Shepard was observable and it is generous in view of the material. Personally, it is the director, the screenwriters and especially the producers that I would love to see tar-born before they were sent to Guantanamo as the toys for the prisoners, and it is me who holds this 'little'.
