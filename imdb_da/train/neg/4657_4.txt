Remakes (and sequels) have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the medium. It's pretty much a hit or miss venture though. If you take what is good from the original and build on it and update key features with current standards, you can succeed. Note that such films as THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) succeeded in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserably. <br /> <br /> SHORT COMPETITION (1945) is the template for this movie. It is as perfect as it could be on such a subject and we consider it IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. Why has it just happened to the two (2) instructors involved at the wrong time. These are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive way by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither is conventional leading Star material, but quality Character Actors. For the details see the movie. <br /> <br /> Now what went wrong? A T.V. Movie, almost remade scene for scene by name actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least scored IMDb ****** Six. However, both actors seem uninterested, just showing off their clock and getting their control. Neither is involved in their characters or with each other. You don't think they are in love, or when they finally separate it, it's a big loss for both of them. It should not be, and that is why it fails in its intention. Sometimes it's just better to leave things alone.
