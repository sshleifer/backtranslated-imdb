This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vivid games. I can only guess that the intention was to make the game as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not previously been exposed to Shakespeare. By doing this, however, by making each line clear and all intentional, they have drained the game of life and turned into a flat caricature. Somehow it's actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful material. The play is at best forgettable - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not go as well. April Shawnham's Hero is a puddy, airless air cushion that often produces wins. Jerry Mayer's Don John is an indecent cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash (though Snidley was much more fun). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know the guy who killed Mozart?) Is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits. <br /> <br /> Since the producer Joseph Papp is basically a theater god, this production is not only disappointing, but also main scraper. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this. See Branagh's very Ado instead - his version is crowded with vitality and humor not to say anything about wonderful performances.
