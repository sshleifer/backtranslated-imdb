I have written at least half a dozen reviews of this creepy little girl and no one is published, so I have to opine that someone on imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a bunch of oilmen can revive a military tank that has put in the desert for over a decade and to make a fighting machine again is ridiculous. Then the play and the direction. Beware it.
