It certainly fits in with the time, as Axis and Allies played espionage games in most of North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of movies, but certainly not the worst of the budget films described earlier from the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was actually very good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkus). Why he never got any major roles is over me. He played the perfect buddy / partner role and saved the movie ... imho. As said, this movie was part of a budget package from Superbox-Mart entitled War Classics. Eight movies to eight bucks that included other never-heard-movies that have some decent stars trying to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... yes, not so hot. Editing and movies are worse. If you can by-pass all this and want to see the future Cisco Kid & a great sidekick that unfortunately never met its true potential, surely pick it up! Otherwise there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
