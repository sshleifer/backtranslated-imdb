This film has the core of a really good story. The coastguard men's and men's work, especially in the North Pacific, is heroic and legendary. This movie mucks up a good story with three conclusions (no one satisfying), a couple of unnecessary and meaningless barriers and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as much spark as dead campfires. The rescue scenes are amazing - although computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are quite unreal - but the background is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (look for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not horrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she is on camera for approx. two minutes throughout the movie. It could have been an excellent movie - and Costner needs one!
