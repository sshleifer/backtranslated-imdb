We've been served - a horrible movie. Okay, I admit that since I am white and have had no practical experience in the "competitive dance dance world", I may not be exactly an authority on this type of movie. On the other hand, I know a bad movie picture when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I've just seen it. <br /> <br /> Filmed in low budget vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A Touch of Pink"), "How She Move" tells the story of how important it is to follow one's dreams - even if those dreams include top up for loud, annoying hip-hop music and talking dialogue The average person would not understand whether he or she had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a little synopsis of "the plot." First of all, there are two actors that look like LL Cool J, working in a car shop in Toronto (Mecca of Racial Diversity), but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other guys in this "crew", including a token white guy and a guy similar to Denzel Washington in "Malcolm X." There are also two women in the movie - you look like Serena Williams, and the other is like Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show". One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent her entire teaching on a drug-abused sibling. The other girl who is a member of the Salt N Pepa is undoubtedly just not good. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's buckwheat while still being another actor who is a Huggy Bear knock-off. These guys are rival step dancers. This activity is apparently a lot of hoods in the hood and they all practice for the big "Step Monster" jam in Detroit. Since I could not understand 90 percent of the dialogue (perhaps some subtitles would have been useful as in a Bergman movie or one music video of snow), it is difficult to explain what happens except that there are many arguments, Serena The Williams girl (who never smiles by the way) becomes freelance stepper (moving from group to group), there is some stardans and very annoying hip-hop music. It's a typical rags-to-riches story; such as "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without grin. <br /> <br /> But why should a movie - which could have had a big impact on black audiences - include drug abuse, bad parents, and a title that sounds like a first-degree saying the phrase "How she moves"? <br /> <br /> I was "moved" by this movie, though. Moved to leave the theater as soon as possible.
