I was in a babysitter a family of three young children for one night and their mother gave me this to show that they had just taken it at Wal-Mart earlier this week. All three children were actually physically ill while they were watching. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they had all taken from school, but it could really have been this movie. Totally disgusting. How anyone can produce this caliber of garbage is over me. Luckily, I quit the movie when I noticed that the children did not react and seemed strange. For all parents out there, I strongly recommend you to refrain from allowing young children to watch this movie.
