It is undoubtedly one of the worst pictures I have ever paid money to see - the kind of girl you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for something good but still dead watch a movie! And that's exactly how I came to see this smelly bomb ... At the distance of the better part of three decades, I can still smell the rotting fish that make up this story line. Incredible plot - that a killer whale carries a wrath against an individual, not the sea - is ridiculous. And it's about everyone, except for a completely out of place "love theme" that plays over a movie without a lasting love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just chews on stage. He was no captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not "jaw". Mercifully, I have made the most of my thoughts, and when I run over on television broadcasts, I immediately move on. "Danger, Robinson will!" See the current t.v. commercial shows a husband and wife whale watching ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it's over in sixty seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never return.
