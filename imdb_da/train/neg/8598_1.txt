Just for fun! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was so bad it was fun. My friend and I were renting it because it looked so bad. Cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs. The plot stunk, some of the voices were called, the quality was horrible. But I probably had a blast see it!
