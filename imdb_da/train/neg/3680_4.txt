I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 6/6/02 to be precise. I was killed and tried to convince myself to get out of bed when a terrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I looked at several neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem and saw a smoke noise rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a moment later by the sirens. I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, going back to the kitchen and spotting the picture of a glass-crushed bus. The bus was still close to the pick-up station where a terrorist boarded and with a single click on a TNT unit that killed 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. Wife of a good friend of mine sat on the bus at the back, a seemingly arbitrary and pointless decision that saved her life. I am sure every Israeli has at least one terror-related memory he wants he would never have had, and it was just a matter of time before anyone made a movie about it. As it turned out, the film was becoming a repressed memory of itself. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a play-write on a dry race, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the movie), who spends the best part of his day performing star competitions with its glossy word processing page. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt-burdened ex-army officer. Buzaglo, bored and slightly paranoid because of what is medically known as "what is there on earth, this hot baby is dating me" syndrome, asks a private eye to make an effort on her boyfriend. As a detective progress in his study, his observations penetrate into the play and later into the lives of his actors. Meanwhile, the game of a cartoon metamorphoses into an indictment against Israeli society. When it comes to the movie, the film becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, separated into its small cardboard characters and unreliable dialogues, while driving miles away from the subject it should deal with at first. <br /> <br /> When I say "card grades", I refer to the characters that, under the author's / director's obsession for a "meaningful" movie, were without real dialogues and any kind of reliability. I don't want to elaborate too much on it. Suffice it to say that I'm sure homeless barefoot prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention of seeing a game it is. <br /> <br /> According to Haim Buzaglo, this film is even the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two movies will be derived from the experience that I wrote about at the beginning of my review, as opposed to the remote world of characters that are anything but existing and a plot that is anything but compelling. /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This movie was a landmark in tightening. It was shot in ten days, all the players worked for free, and the whole price of the movie was about $ 12,000 (no, I did not omit a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). Make you wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete the Blair witch project.
