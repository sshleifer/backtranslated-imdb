Spoilers in front if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I almost recommend this movie so people can really see a 1/10. Where do we start, we start from the top ... The story: Don't believe in the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and ultimately people understand what the mysterious events are. It is a dream, basically, going in cabin movies without intensity or "effort". SCREENPLAY: I usually give credit to indie scriptwriters, it's hard work when you start ... but this is bad. The story is flat - it gives you numb the whole movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictably boasts lines of "Woah, you've totally confused me" and "I wondered if you would ... if you want to ... well, would you come to the cabin with me?". It makes me tear out my entire hair, one string at a time and feed it to myself. <br /> <br /> THE COURSES: HOLY CRAP !!!! Some have described the signs as flat, I will take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arc. In fact, they begin to work in a parallel universe and begin to act backwards ... <br /> <br /> ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They already take poor written characters and add acting in horrible high school drama. "Woah you totally freaked me out" was said so monotonous and slow - as it was stupid. I could complain for hours alone on the actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie. For shady areas, also bleached in others. The director should not use light as emotion until he learns to properly correct a basic scene. Small steps! SOUND: How many sound fans does it take to make a real shotty sound movie? 9. With these many healthy guys, it should sound great, but the opposite has happened. There is especially a scene that really sticks out, they drive in a car, and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle .... DANGER! CAMERA: Learn how to use it. In any case, I run out of complaint ... rent it - I dare ... Rent it and learn from it ... give it a 1 rating .. it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Signing ... Amanda Christmas
