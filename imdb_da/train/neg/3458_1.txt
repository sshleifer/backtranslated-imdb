Usually I am not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so incredibly painful that I feel like I should. I cringed on the terribly predictable plot, the lame worked and laughed at moments that should be tense. In fact, most of the audience seemed rather boring and chatty even on the film's "most tense" moment. Molly Ringwald stood as the only achievement of any profit in a tortured production. Even the "twist" at the end was not. I've heard it said the movie didn't take seriously; but I could find some documentation for that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The clip should have been left on the cutting floor. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
