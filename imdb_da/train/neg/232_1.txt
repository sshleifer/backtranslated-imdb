This had to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they start clapping ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate ran her hands over the sidewalk, it turned out she was studying the consistency of the casting. Andie's plays are so bad in this movie - I couldn't connect or feel they love each other. The other 2 women, however, were very good and overshadowed Andie. Still, it was such a campy movie. I usually like this type of movie, but I just couldn't get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's plays did not contribute to the movie. She is also all gums. Lancome has to put her makeup on with a knife knife because she looks glamorous in the commercials.
