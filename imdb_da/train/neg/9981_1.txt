This movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery. It fails in both cases. The only mystery here is why would anyone make such a poorly constructed movie. The only comedy is the laugh I got when I saw how high the readers here ranked it. Can there be two movies with the same name? The movie I saw starring a girl with beautiful blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
