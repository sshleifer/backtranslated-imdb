I sat through this turkey because I hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential. It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly erect and not a leaf moves! In fact, when the characters move outside the house, it is bright sunlight that makes the tree visible. At that time, regardless of the credibility of film developers developed, evaporating faster than the highly localized rain in their films. Surely all hurricanes are not like this, it would definitely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine State.
