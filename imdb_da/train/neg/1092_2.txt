Well, I suppose the good news about William Winckler's 2001 opus, "The Double-D Avenger", is that he manages to unite three of Russ Meyer's kills - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in one image. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were admitted that week they shot this thing ... otherwise, managed to see a copy of the manuscript in advance!) The bad news, though (and there is plenty of it is that this film - if it can even be called it has been shot directly to video - is a completely misfire, a total abortion, a widespread cruelty, an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst images , I have ever seen. Look no further at the lameest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, as it is, deals with kitten, who gets superpowers after beating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oy), and later a trio of megalung bikini dancers fight back in LA for anybody lame boob ghost traces fall completely (you should apologize for the term) flat that there is ZERO really nudity in the movie at all (except for some old kitten pictures in her flowering time) and that some shaving cream and papier-mache bricks are the sum of The special FX. Meyer gals here is a bit long in tooth / saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, though Sheri Dawn Thomas, as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Manages to do well. So why did I give this juvenile, unfunny, the embarrassment of a movie failed 2 stars instead of 1? To be concise: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary on the features of the DVD I've just seen is quite hilarious, especially when he pulls out about 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from 1,000+ on his site's "Canonical Hooters List." The man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a landscaping disc!
