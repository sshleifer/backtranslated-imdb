I saw this .... let me reformulate ... suffered through this because I'm a fan of Eva's. I don't think it's a glimpse she puts on the back of her headshot. I like gangsta flix, but it wasn't even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars, and the money was probably spent on the catering company. The principle was interesting, but the first victim died before you got the chance to care about her or not. <br /> <br /> I don't want to bother saying who did what and how because it's not worth doing. I am only pleased that due to my monthly rental plan in the local video store, I did not have to pay for this waste. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you blaze at me, I love movies, I thought a lot of flix was good that some of you have stuck, so for me to jam it tells you everything you need to know.
