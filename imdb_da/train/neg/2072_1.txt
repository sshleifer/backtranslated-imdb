I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a funny movie. I figured you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with superpowers. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was confused and pointless ... it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing scratches. Also the author kept throwing in the way also much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love. It looks like it might have been so easy to draw a story out of Fatal Attraction Super hero .. but I don't guess that. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy it was announced to be. You couldn't take a child to see it and you'd be embarrassed to see it a date. <br /> <br /> If the author had made a basic story about the high concept and cleared it up - the movie could have a fight chance. <br /> <br /> A great waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
