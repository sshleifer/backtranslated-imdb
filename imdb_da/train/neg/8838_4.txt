There are similarities between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his last movie "Lantana" ?? a dead body and its consequences for already dysfunctional life. But while "Lantana" offered some hope and a solution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in a grim way that will leave most viewers dissatisfied, perhaps even cheated. <br /> <br /> The story - the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery of a body floating in a remote river - is based on a brief history of Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic 1993 ensemble "Short Cuts". Lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exhibition of relationships within a small Australian society under stress. The movie poses some moral issues "Will you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?" and more poignantly for the Australians "Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal?" The action, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mystery enhanced by having haunted music, not unlike "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the foundation of a great movie - be prepared for a downturn, the pace is very slow and the murder is almost in the beginning and thus eliminates the element of mystery. And then we are back with these desolate lives and an empty finale.
