Criminal Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, and that is also a good thing, because when I have seen a movie and know there is a sequel (especially something that is as unclear as this) , I'm always curious. I have now had my curiosity satisfied and will never see it again. Most of the CI2 is nothing more than "flashbacks" to CI, and I think the footage of Ethel's sleep, reminiscent of good memories. Thanks to Proposition 13, she is released from Napa State (wondering if she should watch The Cramps play while she was there?) And sent to a halfway house run by a lovely old lady who Ethel immediately calls "grandmother" . This is all filmed with a camcorder, so the picture and sound are quite pathetic, and it is even complete with a few "rolls". Of course, Ethel does her thing that is sending someone between her and food, especially the guy who testifies of one of her actions and spreading her dessert. In addition, you have to think of a half-house for murderers who have a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the sink. Guess it all is a matter of misunderstood "trust". If you liked or dislike Criminally Insane, there is no good reason to see this except out of curiosity. One wonders why the decision makers of this self disturbed. 2 out of 10
