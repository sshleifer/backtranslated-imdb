This movie is another on my list of movies that should not apply. So, 40 years ago as young people, kept up late to do so, was very annoyed to find out that it was about 95% romance, 4% everything else, 1% history if that. That's what I call a bait and shift movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good filming, this movie is almost an insult to those who earned. The actual members of Lafayette Escadrille were not coming from the law nor were they the products of violent homes, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suppose many of them came from a more overcrowded background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not the wise alecks, and it knows, a person like this one here would not last for two days, it would either have been the stockad or infantry. Discipline in the French army was often quite tough. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
