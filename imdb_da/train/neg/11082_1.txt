I know it's a Power-Rangers gimmick and taken into account 7-year-olds, but really why did they take this movie seriously? If they are to write a plot of crayons, at least have a decency to make it silly. It's a little fun if you see this. We have a typical family filled with clich√©s (father a war veteran who lost his wife and blame himself LOLOL), airborne children are trying hard to fill in the stereotype, but fail with horrible acting and a ridiculously horrible sidekick that doesn't serve any purpose movie, but to fill the camera space. Fun stuff! <br /> <br /> But the right good moment comes close to the end when warrior and bad acting villain tries to work a sword fight, but then they realize that none of them know how to (probably because there is no room for choreographers' budget) so they come up with this American gladiator type setting to run around in. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they are trying to treat this seriously.
