What is this for? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was visible and as good as the first movie in the beginning, but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in their dreams, it began to be childish. This sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 instead of R. I expected to see some very mature stuff, but it was only for 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for young children. Plus it is focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy's a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting demons. Why should it always be Christianity? This is total orientalism and filled with the superiority of white men / westerners. Don't look at this, show it to young children who love power.
