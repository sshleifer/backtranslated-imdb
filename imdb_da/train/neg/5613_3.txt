In my opinion, this film does not promote any new thought. I think to take a spear to a spear without looking at the page! the director seems to have an agenda! You h! I find out that his rational shortcomings do not seem to fit the alternative view. I for one is usually on the side of naysayer, but this movie lacks credibility as it depends on the amazing sightings of man / woman on the street. Really now, if you want to create a credible alternative to a fidelity held for 2000+ years, do more of your efforts so the other side can vote their faith. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie, it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, I for one is a non-believer, but allows other people's faith and does not want to ridicule them, but try to understand and tolerate.
