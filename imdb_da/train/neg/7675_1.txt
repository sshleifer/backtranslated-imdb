Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features at all? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After halving the horrible 'House of the Dead', director Uwe Boll has now thrown his less than talented eye toward yet another adaptation of video games. Don't these guys get it? For anyone who cannot understand, this is in block letters for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE GOOD MOVIES! The action here is at best sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike video games (which had its scary moments), the film has no atmosphere of impending judgment, no sense of danger or threat. Pacing and plotting are confused, and the paper on which the script is printed would have been better used as toilet paper. The lead role is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with a monkey's grace and skill when using a brush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced ​​into whole boring affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why this guy was ever charged near a movie set should initially be one of the greatest secrets in modern cinemas. Avoid at all costs.
