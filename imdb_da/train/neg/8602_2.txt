Everything you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a guy falls into a lake and is eaten. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see "Slugs!" in capital letters, followed shortly by "The Movie." Whew! I was worried that I had accidentally voted in "Snails: The Musical" or "Snails: The Game Show." Anyway, from there, the movie gets worse for a kill party. You see a guy cutting his hand out because he had snails in his garden gloves, two people being attacked by snails while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passage is killed by killing snails. It's a pretty stupid movie that falls into the "so bad-it's-good" category. It's also shot so badly with such a grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I am very surprised that it has got as high a score as it has here because most people here do not give any kind of movie to those kind of movies. But if you want a movie trying to be scary but end up being ridiculous, this is one of your primary candidates.
