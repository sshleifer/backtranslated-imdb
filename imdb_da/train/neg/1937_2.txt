The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was nice to see and I wanted to see the inevitable happening between them. But when the action changed to Ingrid's fiance, it became completely different. Instead of romance and charm, we see some eerie dopey parallel characters appearing that destroy the movie. The fiance is boorish son and military attach√©'s vying for the girls' attention looked stupid - kind of like a plot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the movie can make room for dopiness is beyond me. This movie is an obvious attempt to regain Renoir to regain the success he had with the GAMES OF THE GAME, as the movie is very similar when the action changes to the country's property (as in the other movie). I wasn't a big fan of the GAMES, but ELENA AND HERE BUT had me appreciating the art and shades of the original movie.
