I'm a big Stooges fan, but the only and redeeming quality this movie has is that Curley is in it. Made long before he started drinking heavily, he is his classic himself in this (and Larry is also not bad). Moe character is an equal part (mostly) and this movie would be better known as "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that any of the Stooges movies were very good (in my opinion), but as a commentary said, how sad it is that this movie had real potential. The casting was good, it was well aimed, filmed and edited, but the story was to be something serious with just some Stooges antics and musical tracks (which I think were good then) thrown in. The best thing you can do for yourself during this movie is to think that it should be better than cutting the lawn and getting out of the garbage (which is the subject of debate) waiting for Curley / Larry scenes and sleeping or finding something in the kitchen to eat for the rest of it.
