The main complaint with this movie is that I can NOT tell who is who. No racism intends, but these Asians look all the same! I can tell something about the story, but hey it's as far as it goes. People's identities are not a mystery if they were a mystery I would like to break. Instead, I wasn't away from the ASAP screen. <br /> <br /> Lots of wide shots and silent numb faces occupy this movie. Heck, it's boring, I don't just know these people, but they're just sitting there. <br /> <br /> Production is typically Chinese John Woo, horrible video with soft scenes. This looks a little better than Andy Laugh's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie.) You would think with a decent budget, they could at least make it look like the 90s Hollywood. I did not know that the Chinese had these art houses beatniks.
