Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after killing the previous one. Although he is witnessing that a treasure is being buried, he begins to lose his memory, and the tax card he gets gets shiny. Dick is thus forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for it?) And help guide a path to the treasure. It is fun how much you could have the bankroll this meaningless movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as an instructor and gave Medak's talents in the movie The Ruling Class, you might guess which of the grainy, ill-lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a short look in the film's first 10 minutes as the convicted pirate captain. He is quite grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year, this was filmed and canned so he could keep it away from his resume. Franciosa looks like the beautiful Power-Back Scratcher, but he and Seller both look quite desperate, with even the seller's makeup and hair looking pretty awful. They had to know that this movie was bombing even though they filmed it. With lines like these I can understand every possible discomfort: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (by hanging) You pay for this. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won t. I do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that's one of the good jokes. It's amazing to me that much of Sellers' productive material is still in the vault, but it was made available at VHS more than 15 years ago! How about somebody going on the record and in the United States releasing the well-received British television show "A Show Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester?
