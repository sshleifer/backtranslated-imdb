In fact, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There is not a bunch of clowns running around blasting away using hundreds of rounds, but never hitting meat. There are also no wild tree / collisions where thousands of dollars of valuable machines are useless. <br /> <br /> The interior looks respectfully modern, architectural, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Now there is the high-tech computer room decorated with what looks like remnants from a 50's electronics lab. And the pancake makeup on the bodies blew me up. Not pancake makeup in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This should support the idea that the organs have calcified - although how the virus would achieve this transmutation, is an exercise left for the student (viewer). Ah yes, viruses. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst condition for a sci-fi horror girl I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television screen (or computer screen) and becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la "Star Trek" is one thing, but photons become viruses? This is so stupid the desired "scare factor" is just not realizable. The girl could have used one of the horrible dream sequences where the dead are alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral tingama jig does not. <br /> <br /> One supposition that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in this inanity, as Lord Oliver gave to some of his later trashy venues. He needed the money. However, no other comparison between the two should be interpreted.
