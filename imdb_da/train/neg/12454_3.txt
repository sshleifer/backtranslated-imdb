I've read posts here about Wonder Woman's costume for this movie. It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made, she did not have her traditional outfit. The producers actually held the cartoonist's view of WW in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, I agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was in the right age to appreciate a movie about a cartoon hero. But I was so "engrossed" with the plot, I stopped seeing it three quarters in the movie. Of course, I wasn't in the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
