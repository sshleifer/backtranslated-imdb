What is in heaven? Is it a plane? Is it Superman ?? Errr, no ?? It's a trip!?! See, that's what gets off the cold war! Nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans shoot down a Russian fighter plane somewhere over the Artic area, and the subsequent explosion defrosts and literally evokes the huge prehistoric turtle called Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly critter, as it immediately follows to destroy everything and everyone on his way. The arguing governments finally decide to kill the nasty bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice boom, but Gammera has another surprise in the store ?? The damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens, results in a hugely grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera lies on her back and looks defeated when he suddenly turns off the armpits and skyrockets himself in the air. How can you not love it? Then there is also a profound sub-point about an annoying child who is able to telepathically communicate with the monster, but it just isn't interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is little else to write about this Japanese (and American re-edited) sci-fi effort, except that it is a blatant and utterly shameless rip-off of such classics as the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and monster design are extremely hokey and unlike the aforementioned films, they never succeed in creating an apocalyptic mood. Respective actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not seem to know what movie they are on, and even the original Japanese chaos scenes are not very convincing. However, Gammera's very own and personal theme song is pretty cool, so it gets an extra point for it.
