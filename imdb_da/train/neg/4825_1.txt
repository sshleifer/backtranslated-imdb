Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a great horror movie focusing on junkies. What I got was complete crap focusing on junkies. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookers" that these people went through? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them hit me so well-written or well-acted. Basically the whole movie I just spent shaking my head and wondering about the stupidity of the stupid addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or another decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! The animated penguins are frightening and more convincing than anything you find in "Cookers".
