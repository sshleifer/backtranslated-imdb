I am a stupid person to rent DVD REDLINE. Chicago Photos that made this silly movie have never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various car sites, including mine, which has an ALEXA rating of 16K. They struck me off with the deal and now I'm $ 16,000 and they wasted a lot of my personal time (peter report from Palisades Media) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Don't rent or buy this movie !!! It sucks, and the people behind it are ripoff artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of losers and bad actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a Joke
