The question, when you see a movie, so bad, is not necessarily: "How did a movie that is bad, made?" or even, "Why did I see this terribly in the first place?" but "what have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because "rules" for horror movies have been cataloged and satirized countless times over the last ten years, does not mean that anyone will not go ahead and make a movie there uses ALL of them without a lint of humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie is to be described as ** resolved ** based on the video game, you have scripting issues. <br /> <br /> - The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you may be proud to find out how to make the "Matrix Effect" on a budget, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to use it again and again after nausea. <br /> <br /> - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee election rolls. <br /> <br /> - When a scene doesn't change together, just use some footage from the video game, no one will notice. <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap-metal band offers to write your movie's theme free, polite decline. <br /> <br /> Zombie movies are not one for people to kill zombies. They are about zombies that kill people, preferably in the most cruel way. That's what makes them SCARY. <br /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1,600 to get to a rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Everything else you will find out of your own two lines when someone asks, "What was that?" or "Where are we?" Only boobs are not horror movie panacea. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter boom shot and a license agreement with Sega transform your movie magically from "student movie" to "major student solution". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you mention-drop all three "Living Dead" movies, you don't make George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies but only because I've seen "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation."
