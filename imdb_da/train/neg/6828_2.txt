In a movie that follows a fighting actor, apparently played by a fighting actor, it doesn't matter to Chris Klein. He struggles to bring everything memorable to the role and winds through the low script to show what can only be described as a gentle leading man. The story exists, but it is all and does not show any basic start, middle and end, and the viewer is left with shrug as if nothing in the last hour and three quarters really happened. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out over his seemingly medieval then-co-stars and does a half-decent job of bringing Legde's backward character to life. About Fred can restore this when he works with a higher caliber of cast remains to be seen, but I am watching him in the future.
