Like most people, I was fascinated when I heard the concept of this movie, especially "the filmmakers were then attacked", as the case seems to emphasize what the film cabinet image is being chased by an angry mob. <br /> <br /> So to watch the movie and discover, oh what they mean by "the filmmakers were being attacked", some kids were throwing stones at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said "someone should beat the two kids up. "The picture on the cover," chase "as it was? Total fabrication. As I assume, tie in with the film's theme, lie and manipulation to satisfy vain, stupid children with more money and time so upscale. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what great truth the viewer should take away from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me" but whose "Roger & Me" was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It is completely misdirected and completely inane. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered from the municipality's ok would be very excited about having markets full of food? What fools! And it's not so much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and Western media blah blah blah", as it was not just that their fake market had comparable prices to its competitors, that is what many people in the movie say, the prices were absurdly low, someone mentions that they should have known that it was false how much they charged for duck. It proves nothing, except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices, bravo fellas, a way to keep it to people at the bottom. <br /> <br /> Way to play a stupid practical joke on older people. You must be very proud. What about your next movie, you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people who will be really excited about a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say, "HAHA! NO HOME EQUIPMENT! BY MEDIA! ". <br /> <br /> Morgan Please Like Me Spurlock released this wet pace of a movie, and it's no surprise when Spurlock, as a hit, Wonder Prince of the Documentary World seems to shed its weight behind any stupid sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that doesn't really need it. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
