This movie has little to recommend it, although the little one is the breathtaking scenery, filmography and direction of wildlife, it is difficult to retrieve its weak points in the company of such rave reviews. It is precisely these things that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its implementation so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my kids and none of us was too impressed with the end. Yes, the pictures were great, the wide landscapes across the forest and the mountains magnificent, but what was happening in the foreground? The rather boring story of the stupidity of a creepy girl who learns too slowly a very basic lesson about being friendly to wildlife - and getting it quite easily when you get to know that kind of thing. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is no distant novel about how it is told, and we have all seen this before, and much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really needs to be fetched from this movie is a sense of how to work with these amazing lenses and forest lights; The rest is a waste of time.
