Do not waste your time. This movie is rehashed the worst by Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and stupid biblical references) and Blade (high tech toys). I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good. But not this sucks. Even the soundtrack does not help it, mostly because the movie resorts for ridiculously scary classical music instead of "kick-ass metal" some reported. Only a few times I heard some metal; for the most part it became tortured violins. Avoid it like garlic and spices.
