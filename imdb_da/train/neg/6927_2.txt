Although I classified this movie a 2 to show a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror movie, it was a 10 on the unintentional fun scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were, but it didn't matter because I knew every scene had something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie, but I think it is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the film extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from start to finish, or if you watch it back, you will be confused with pleasure. I especially like the scene where the inmates turn around without stabbing each other. I think the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius!
