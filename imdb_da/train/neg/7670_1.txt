Well where do I start my story ?? I went to this movie tonight with a couple of friends who didn't know more than the actors who were in it and that it was going to be a horror movie. I figured within the first 20 minutes what a bad decision I had made of watching this movie. The reason was shed, and that was also the script. The lines were terrible to the point that people in the audience laughed hysterically. The throw could not have been more plastic. Even some of the scenes thought they should have been done much faster ... just as they did without any particular reason. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
