Even if possible dulls the original (I hope I can say it under the IMDb guidelines). The French connection has at least attempted to absorb European influences in order to complicate the US police detector's conventional view, although the experiment was founded by Friedkin's ambivalence, Americaness and general indirection. The (relative) arthouse boom from the 1960s (especially with the nouvelle vague) allowed a great influence of European cinema in Hollywood. This lent a new force and complexity to a tired medium, and in the best of them (eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, early scoring), a new subversion of received practices. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its difficult distanced style and anti-detective figure. TWO is the old Hollywood's right orientation of American values. <br /> <br /> This is considered in the movie's very tiring America vs France dialectics. For example, TWO is shot as a 70-year-old French politician. Of course, it was the French who insisted on the greatness of the American film when they were ignored at home, and it is in some way a recovery, a warning against the Gallic presumption. This can be seen in the pattern of the two films. CONNECTION has French gangsters invading New York with the French style that fights the American thriller - it leads to the dissolution of the detective figure and the dissolution of the plot - baddie came away. <br /> <br /> Two Americans returning to France with American thriller values ​​imposed on the strength of the original genre detective have resumed and conventional resolution is achieved. This is further dramatized in Doyle's relationship with French inspector Barthelmy, whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot. TWO seem to follow the original by undermining its detective hero. From the start, Doyle's importance diminished at every turn. Despite the end of connection, he is considered a hero. But he is American in a foreign country and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot. He even rejects signs of the police force, fails an informant for a criminal and gets him killed. <br /> <br /> The power of a detective comes from his power as an object to see and interpret, but Doyle uses much of the film being monitored, controlled, an object, a body (literally in the scenes, after that he is dumped by Charnier) must be seen and interpreted. In connection, he initiated the action, chasing the criminals, forcing the plot; Here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, an addiction, a dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of power is predictably symbolized in the loss of his gun, and the film follows a depressingly known Oedipal track. In the heroin sequences, he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son. His drugging is like a return to the womb, robbed by adult pressure. Her taking her watch amplifies the early age of that state, double the importance of a man whose career depends on timetables and precision. Oedipus was the first detective, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this fake mother who solves his overall identity and kills his father (Charnier) so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society. The psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s (ironically initiated by a Frenchman, Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see a movie literally full of it. <br /> <br /> If all these facts tend to minimize Doyle, the movie's style doesn't. Friedkin distanced us from his hero by denying empathy or character motivation, focusing on the plot's mechanics. Here, Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero. Instead of being lost in dark long shots, he is made knowledgeable and understandable by the viewer with the traditional units - viewing angles, close-ups, connections, etc. <br /> <br /> Two are about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. Plot in this case is subject to the actor, which is the usual Hackman showiness. The cold turkeys scenes, therefore, despite their boredom, are not disturbing. We must observe parts rather than cold; this a much less unpleasant experience. The scenes have also been shot with a lachrymose male sentimentality that is very American. <br /> <br /> So while CONNECTION tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville, the TWO does the opposite. Melvils LE SAMOURAI highlighted a gangster who started the movie all over, powerful outspoken and mapped his possible breakdown. Two begin with a destructive nature, achieved partly through the inability of language, whose dominance begins when he goes outside of language - the final action sequences are largely wordless. <br /> <br /> In the film, the locality and language are important when setting and undermining the detective, but when he regains his power (counted in the return of his gun and the cathartic burning of the primary side of the vulnerability, the tower block where Charnier held him ), the Marseille setting becomes more irrelevant, and the mythical stand-off that could take place everywhere takes over. Compare the end of the two films: one admits ambiguity and despair, the other absolute security. <br /> <br />
