Lillian Hellman's play, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with help from Hellman, becomes a curious project to get out of the grim Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, representing his Broadway role and winning the best actor Oscar, plays an anti-Nazi German underground leader who fights the fascists, pulls his American wife and three children across Europe before he finds refuge in the States (via the border with Mexico). They settle in Washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, even though a booth resident in the manor house is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends a terrible amount of time at the German Embassy playing poker. It seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the clever, honest, direct refugees who teach the clueless, at all American Americans, how the world has suddenly changed), it seems to be a little patronizing - the viewer is literally placed in the place of the family members, preferred to. Lukas has several speeches in the third act, which undoubtedly won him the Academy Award, but for most of the picture he seems to do a little, but in and out, enter and end. As her spouse, Bette Davis informs no one else and works her broad eyes for good, but the role does not allow her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role as a intended wife (and the unsatisfactory texture she brings to that part seems completely wrong). The intention here was to tastefully show us tactfully just because a (second world war) man can be German, it doesn't make him a Nazi sympathizer. We'll get it in the first few minutes; The rest of this tastefully tactful movie consists of exhibition, defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion. It must be a gentle mixture, but instead it is rather dry and inert. ** from ****
