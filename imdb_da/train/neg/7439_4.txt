Another look of horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films are interesting. But from my American perspective, this movie was just not that good. The main character, Marie played by Anastasia Hille was not a pleasant character and I had difficulty identifying with her. She disagreed most of the time and confused too much about how little time was left. Too much time was also used to bring her to the film's most important location. Then a long time passed before any real tension built up. When that happened, it seemed that volume was used as the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies, and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I would recommend it for rent, but not for theater guests.
