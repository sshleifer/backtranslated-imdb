It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) are a depressing plug at the camera. It is unfortunate that from the many films made annually in Romania, the worst of them gets abroad (eg the Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a plot, play or script is a waste of time and money. Result: 0.02 out of 10.
