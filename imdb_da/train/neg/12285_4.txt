The story is absurd and lame, also sucking is notions and the dialogue is hard to keep your eyes open. I advise you to get a decanter friendly to wake you up in time for a few Gore effects. Why do they bring Alcatraz in? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. Still, I wondered who this movie was for? Shock full of lame subplots (like Cannibalism US Army Captain) This is low quality in all aspects.BTW this movie is banned in Germany !!
