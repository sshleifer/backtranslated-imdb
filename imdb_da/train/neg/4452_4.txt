Let's just say I had to suspend my disbelief for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That is, I have less trouble believing that Toby McGuire can hold onto buildings than I do Elija Wood throws with victories in Manchester. I don't want to get into details as I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​adult, professional, British men coming near dead scares every weekend is good ... fun. And this movie is not. The fighting, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken too seriously. The gravity of Pugilism, the reverence that the subject is being treated, becomes annoying as it neither establishes nor solves the conflict. It looks as if the plot of holes big enough to run a Guiness truck has been merged with a crafted "fish out of the water" theme, so viewers can stare into Wood's teary eyes as he learn to become a man, ie. . hits other young men against soccer tastes with dumb objects and then runs away as quickly as possible. The characters are cartoon-like, especially the Americans at Harvard. The drawing development and the narrative line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the image. Unfortunately, the film's absurdity does not reach its height to almost the end, which in that case has spent almost two hours in your life, you will never be back. Pick up "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this corny and disappointing dud. It does not waste time with empty melodrama, the tired old "Yankee in King Aurthur's Court" or crying, parables about getting into age. They are just pure, dark and clever fun; the way violence should be.
