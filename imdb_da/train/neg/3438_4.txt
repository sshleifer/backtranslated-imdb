Haunted Boat sells itself as 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways, this is accurate. There are scary and weird people who keep you interested. <br /> <br /> But the working ability is at best poor. Shows clear signs that this is just a bunch of friends making a horror movie. As in all credit, they do the best. When you accept the low budget it makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts looking largely like men with rubber masks. Many aspects of the movie are scary and strange. But it suffers to use too many twists and turns in a short time, which just leaves you bored and confused. With regard to keeping you awake, the film does it very well. Ignoring the irrelevant twist every 5 seconds near the end, you will actually know what is happening. And willing to wait 1 hour 35 minutes for climax. <br /> <br /> This is not Ghost Ship, but it will definitely do for an evening ahead of T.V.
