Contrary to another reviewer, I think this is well-written, especially the more fictitious, because greater imagination would be required; and acted well, because there were no other signs to share the focus on these dozens-plus, well-finished monologues. But I'm just not entertained by such solemn, pious memories. Everyone has a story to tell, and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. There are only ten, non-very atypical stories and problems that exemplify how one's life (or part of it) is feed for movies. So again I think badly on TV's reality shows too. So if it's your bag, you like it here. These are the kinds of things that would do for good 'phone and / or internet gossip; but absolutely without other than verbal actions. And even though each of the speakers is female, I will leave sex out of this.
