=== less spoilers === <br /> Like many others, I'm a big Jerry Bruckheimer fan. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out in front, and the trailer came by before MI: 2, expectations rise. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar-Angelina Jolie. What may be wrong? A lot. <br /> <br /> The script is neither fun (which it really tries to be) or exciting. You put in a black person who constantly makes racial jokes about himself and Wooh-haa !! do you have comedy? I do not think. Voltage is completely out of the picture. First of all (and that's probably said many times), there are no sympathetic signs, so who cares who is being killed? If you can lose the premise that a psycho will kill Nick's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is going again with Nic on the street again. Is this excitement? Don't think. Then comes the best bit - romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually looks bored having to pronounce all those stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" 'What went wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> There is only one glimpse of hope left: the car is chasing. They are disappointing at least because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there is only one. A very long one caught in annoying hectic camera movement. I really had trouble following the action. <br /> <br /> Is there an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - There is no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I give 3 out of 10 stars and I want to be generous.
