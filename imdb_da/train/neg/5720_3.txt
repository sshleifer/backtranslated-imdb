Some gorehound friends recommended "Live Feed" to me and I can't really complain as the movie probably delivers abundant slice of peanut and pants, but of course it's not a very good movie. More than obviously, the latest trend in horror cinema pays, the so-called torture porn, Ryan Nicholson, tries to surpass any other movie in this subgenre (and it includes the role models "Hostel" and "Saw") with its sick & twisted makeup Effects and thoroughly displaced shots of naked collaborators attempted, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no concrete map to describe. Five completely brainless thieves some friends take a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but apart from that, I don't really know why they chose to travel there instead of Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the continent's culture and even cause a hectic scene when they experience a local slaughterhouse a sweet whale dog on the market. The quintet subsequently appears in the shabby nightlife, and one of them insults a leader of a criminal clan. A simple excuse is obviously not enough, as gangsters follow them into an adult theater and gradually expose them to evil torture. A girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake pushed down her throat; yikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite all bloodshed, and the amateur production values ​​are quite difficult to overlook, even though you are used to seeing independent fan-boy trash cinema like this one. The bold blocks depicted on the cover, an oriental S&M executioner, are pretty cool, and he is also the most talented of the whole pile because at least he keeps his mouth shut all the time. I would not even recommend this pile of filth, but hey, if you like loud and fierce metal music, nauseating torture movies and bad losers, go and watch!
