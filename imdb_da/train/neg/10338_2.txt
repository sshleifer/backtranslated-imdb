This movie is simply stupid. From the cast of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the cool climax, the film is an exercise in wood predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is a detective-fiction sociopath. Unlike Marlow and Spade, which pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This movie makes the hammer a boob by enclosing him with evil who is ... good for stupid to get away with anything. One is so badly drawn that he survives to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the movie are straight out of the Three Stooges book. Velda's dance on barre, for example, or the bad guy who accidentally sticks his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher runs down the middle of the road when the camera is tight on her lower leg, but she is far above the side when the camera pulls back to a wider shot. The worst break, however, takes place prior to popcorn attacks. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, unless the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy. To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must be seen, which is the only reason why it gets two points out of 10.
