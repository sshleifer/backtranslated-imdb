I was true to my respect for Mr. Glover and Mrs Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the film was about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts. <br /> <br /> It's not very good together. It's too choppy and there's a little comedy. I am disappointed. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to watch this movie based on liner notes. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all Mr. Glover and Ms Goldberg's film. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend an evening.
