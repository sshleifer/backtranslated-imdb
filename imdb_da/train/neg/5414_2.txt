This movie is even a big step down to the typical fare awarded by Bollywood. The performance was horrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, goes completely OTT like the villain. The sound track is also not memorable. And despite trying hard, the female leads fail to be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in similar prices at the moment. But this monstrosity is even under his limited ability as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in badly written clich√©s. It is high time for Indra Kumar to hang up his directorial hat. Hope he never leads other eyes like this. The future of Hindi movies is in better hands now. To sum it up, be far away from celluloid waste.
