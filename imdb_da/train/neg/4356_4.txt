As I am not a fan of blood and gut, I found the thrillers completely unnecessary (you spell it) and too real to my taste if you are the type of person who gets their stones away from the beholder on the internet or snus I say go for That, begging belief, what kind of person dreams this sick crap up though. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the potential to be a great movie, the music was also top notch (through the movie and especially the end credits). However, some parts were a bit incredible, as if you were just found by your boyfriend, trust in awaiting torture and death, and all you do is tell her what happened and how you got there, why asked he did not know if she happened to have some scarves or even some air freshner or a piece of chewing gum while he was on it?), come on, most would just scream "hurry up and loose me so let's get it from here QUICK!". where were the pilots, maggots, etc., and when the girl accidentally came across the place, the stench of rotten meat would have sounded a few alarm bells! I would only recommend this movie to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like, I'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that having a very happy Christmas.
