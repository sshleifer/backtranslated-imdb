Gadar is an example of a Bollywood-worst overrated movie ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make period-related films, rubbing a movie. The songs were dull and not the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies, where he hits 100 accidents alone. He even kicks a metal prison door (Indian) and kicks a floating car far away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of scandalous action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know it. Sunny gives a pathetic performance, which in turn repeats the same type of role. A guy claims to fight for his lands piece by using violence. Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with a fantastic body that I would love to bone. But even she couldn't save the movie from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as she usually does, she doesn't do this movie. Maybe cos she played a Muslim, but she doesn't seem like one in the movie. All in all, this is a bad show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who love to watch the Bollywood actress beat up 100 boys. Give me a break.
