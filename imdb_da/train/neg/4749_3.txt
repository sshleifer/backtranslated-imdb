This movie was so poorly written and directed, I fell asleep for 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the film are corny and although the plot is interesting in some angles, it is too far-fetched and at some points - ridiculous. If you are 11 or older, you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger, it is a movie that will catch your attention and be amazed at all the stunts (which I might add are poorly done ) and wish you were some warriors for. The casting in this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was as if they were trying to build the excitement, but it didn't fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 is excellent, 1 is terrible), the act of this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was ridiculous. When she made some of her "battles", I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely to control, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain holds, how her voice gets dark and evil, I think it was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's (Brenda Song) teachers were all her school teachers who were obsessed with monks, it was quite ridiculous to. So sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you are 10 or under.
