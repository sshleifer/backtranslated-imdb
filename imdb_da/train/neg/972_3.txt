This was a disappointing horror movie about a snotty young girl and her nightmare. For a horror or "thriller" movie and hype it is too pretty. There are only a few tense moments here, not just as many as it should have been for a movie of this genre. Even the "tense" scenes weren't much. The music made them more dramatic that they actually were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism in here, so the elite critics feel this "horror movie of a thinking person." Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they'll come to the same conclusion I made - a waste of money on the video rental store. Summary: a slurry that gives an unbearable main character and generally bad trades. Greatly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised.
