Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: Too long face, there are only shots where you mostly feel that the lower half of the film is missing (the screen is cut off) because there appear to be important actions going on , but you can't see them. There is, however, already too much confusion in the movie, so these views make it worse and do not contribute to artificial images. <br /> <br /> I like elaborate movies and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this one tries too hard to be something artificial and fails in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Nothing to be attached to any of the characters because they are not well-crafted. For drawing characters, more than just long facial shots are needed, at least with this set of script + instructor + actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the not-so-good plays are due to the manuscript and director or because of the actors. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from films written and directed by Le You in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie even for someone who would be interested in that part of the story and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
