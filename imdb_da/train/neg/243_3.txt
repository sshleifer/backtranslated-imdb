William Russ is the protagonist of all this made for television films. He left his family behind just to come again and start paying his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in and plays several different roles to convince him to come home. The story is average, and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a pretty good degree. But William Russ was not a star. But it seems that his plays are still OK. <br /> <br /> I found delivery and history very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes could almost dictate words by word before it happened. A good movie should never be that way. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a spare movie. In a letter rating system it would receive a "D".
