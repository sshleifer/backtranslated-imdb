I don't think I've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie throughout my life as I was when I left this piece of shit. Nothing in it makes sense. none of it is clever or well thought out. Out of lack of really exciting moments, they repeatedly use the entire cop-out trick where you build the music before the character does something like opening a door or pushing a curtain and then there's nothing there. It's OK to do sometime maybe, but I counted three times. There are things thrown in without apparent reason, signs, semi-shaped story lines .... the signs were not well developed at all. the end was .. poor. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this movie is horrible. And I'm just here to warn you all that.
