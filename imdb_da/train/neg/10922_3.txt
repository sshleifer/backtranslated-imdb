Worse than the rating given. This is a typical sci-fi movie today: bad for terrible acting, a script that is poorly written and scary. From the opening scene where DeMille buries her set to the end, this movie is horrible. In the early stages, this movie features Moses (which was Charlton Heston in DeMille movies), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand. The characters that were supposed to represent the three above-mentioned icons were terrible and had to resemble the people they were supposed to be "supposedly". The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is fun when someone is hurt, and they shout for an ambulance. Screenwriter is, of course, unaware that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such low quality.
