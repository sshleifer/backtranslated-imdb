My wife and I just finished seeing BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep in some parts of the movie. I really wished I had twisted her, but the unfortunate fact is that the protagonist's voice is so loud and lattice that it was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. He also has no redeeming properties. I hoped he would hit a bus five minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't persuade me, I love Asian horror cinema, but The Booth is extremely annoying and full of scenes that don't really condemn at all. If you want a good Asian cinema, check out a number of two sisters or in the mirror. Avoid booth as a plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
