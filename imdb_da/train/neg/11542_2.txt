An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are being violently and terribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psychologists during a night-time on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who were assaulted, planned and exercised a revenge attack on their attackers ... A completely repulsive piece of voyeuristic waste, somehow masquerading as "thought-provoking" drama while actually coming over as sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been thrown if it had been so easily made in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is appalling and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every globe of his sexual nastiness. His camera lingers hungry on Anderson's naked body both during and after the attack, while the manuscript leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of ​​two-dimensional clichés. His scripts force his characters to behave in such a way that the foreigner is alienated from the "victims" by pushing more horrible situations into their faces (Adam's attempt at subsequent incident attacks on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's attack on Heffer AFTER his suicide. attestation confession). <br/> <br /> The then coming from the key protagonists' notions - Dyer is a horrible actor who is not capable of light and shadow as the young male victim of the original attack (he will end in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. Even when the horrible script forces its character to behave in confused and ridiculous ways, it somehow delivers an extraordinarily convincing and complicated characterization as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who meets such horrors and must reciprocate. <br /> <br /> A silly and meaningless movie, almost but not entirely saved by a convincing central female performance.
