This movie is fun and painful at the same time. "Cinemagic" almost gave me a seizure. Despite what they mean, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. It was "developed" because of an accident and they used it because it spoils the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. Nor do I think it is a case that the author is "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a laugh if you're really looking for a movie made in 9 days of $ 200,000. It's entertaining; at least I can say it. The bat / rat / spider is the highlight.
