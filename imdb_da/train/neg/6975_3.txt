Oh God, what idiotic movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creation is played by a guy in lama costume) and stupid plot. All dialogues are incredibly bad, and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they are simply ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such annoying signs as in this junk (these stupid children or pregnant woman with her husband and many more). All in all, this is a great entertainment if you are drunk. like the plague. I am drunk? I don't think so ...
