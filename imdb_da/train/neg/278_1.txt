I'm trying to make the picture for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking Matrix, I'm thinking about Bladerunner, I'm thinking of the chicken playing Faith in Angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick like her, let it be with us. Only - get it! I will do it without any plot , dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some high armor and a hot chick in shiny black leather that stretches a big throbbing bike. Fanboys digs high bang and hot chicks in shiny black leather, right? "Flashy, low, boring , formal, passionate, boring, boring, stupid, humorous, desultory, barely competent. Live action anime without any action or life. SF just like Joe Fanboy likes it, actually. :(
