Well - when the cameo look of Jason Miller (looks even more hollowed out than he did in Exorcist IV) is the highlight of a picture, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It's a little country, a little rock n 'roll: among two drunks of money pulling their baby everywhere with a bog dried mummy (have you figured out one yet - dried in a moss? ) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad dye and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they had developed her. <br /> <br /> I understand - kind of - that they go back to visit her relatives. After that .... Problem: There are several interesting flashbacks to what I can assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing (I think). This is never associated with anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need for Grandma? Now Grandma could be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can make some of her. The best thing they can do is that she has a tobacco habit. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They cast a real sharp character as a man. Is he cast (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her) or is he thrown to the type (he has a good piece of hair and beautiful clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He's not a bad guy. Not a good one. But dislikable. Why didn't they do anything to him? <br /> <br /> No problem: An old girlfriend shows up. The man paves him down. He comes back to knock down the man. (It gets pretty stupid, but at least it has character motivation.) Now - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; He could only have married her for her money. Grandma is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine into the basement to show her a witch's mummy (do you follow this?) That can come to life. In fact, you know she comes to life, the music swells. A little girl lives in the house, takes tea for grandma (locks the door to do it) and gives grandma with cigarettes. Periodically, granny comes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife lose the baby in the house and then lose their bedroom. Uncle gets the neck in the basement. The leading lady has nosebleeds. The man is drinking. They both drink. In light of all this, the terrible truth mentioned in the first overthrow is omega-abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all these dangling thread ingredients, no one managed to get a story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no modulation from mild disturbance of horrible horror, just long slow scenes that go nowhere. Nbody, really, to worry about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent child in charge of drunks, grandma who might be locked up because she's a monster, but no, her worst mistake is smoking. She has good hair, good makeup. <br /> In short, no plot. Just a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library where the rain goes in and the soundtrack throws us in. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Oh. Nice scenery, good wardrobe. The cameraman knew at least what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
