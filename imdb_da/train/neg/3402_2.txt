Here's why Jane Show won't work. Once again, Canadian bonehead manufacturers and writers cannot create a sitcom without putting a different spin on it.

The characters are two-dimensional and the story lines are way above the top: Forklift racer ??? give me a freaking break. Here's a little advice for the author's play: Don't write fun situations, find the fun in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things, not just being an improvised monkey.
