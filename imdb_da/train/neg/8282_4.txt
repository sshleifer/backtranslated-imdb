Now you already know about this movie, Jessica Simpson's "bomb" that went straight to video (limited, anemic theatrical race). Basically, Simpsons Katie goes from a small Oklahoma town to visit his girlfriend to surprise him, just to find him in bed with another woman. She is stranded, but has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would like to see more often in movies), who lets her stay. Katie ends up getting a job through two matching employees (Penelope Ann Miller and the always entertaining Andy Dick) who just uses Katie to get the company's president (Larry Miller) exhausted. This is strictly a B movie, it is not meant to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress in any way, but she is pretty beautiful and never really annoying. The film is visible in the fact that it is not an abomination, but its caste. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is fun (a subtle in-joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle) and there is a fun scene with Norwegian priests (don't read too much into this). So not terrible but easy to skip. Your sure bid is to watch it on TV if it ever does. Again, not good, but not a deep disaster.
