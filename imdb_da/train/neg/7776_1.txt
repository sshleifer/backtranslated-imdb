What a rubbish. I can't even begin to describe how horrible this movie was. The assessment here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you need the first ginger snaps. The first one was well-written, well-directed, well done .. a brilliant movie with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. The other was 'alrite' decent as an independent film, but clearly not up to the level of the first ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I rate the movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. Oh, and yes it really is in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all confused with some half-assed native American mythology. The sisters do not have any real story or progression or even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and be 'together forever'. It's as deep as it gets. <br /> <br /> Disturbed that the girls agreed to be in this pile after reading the script. Oh and another thing staging action was terrible - people come from neither regularly as the girls turn around and there is a lighted candlestick with a mysterious native American woman just sitting there and entering a speech. The sets were awful, couldn't get away from the fact that it was clearly based on a set that didn't really help. There was also consistently snow outside the camp, but not a track inside (.. on the set). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the other.
