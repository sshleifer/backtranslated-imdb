If you want to see a movie that is strangely shot, strangely lit, weird stories of these men (and a woman) enjoying beating the scream out of each other if you want to enjoy a story that doesn't go in those two guys one a boxer and the other a gay man, then you should see this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I felt almost broken up and cut, as the director (of the movie) even fucked hell out of me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where you are not meant to look at the plot or too big acting, it is a movie to gawk at in horror and wonder. Much like to see a plane crash or a train wreck. <br /> <br /> To watch a good movie, a good movie, a "B" movie or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not it. <br /> <br /> A warning to anyone watching this movie, do not eat in advance. You may want to hit the end of the movie.
