Is it by chance that Orca was made two years after jaws? Orca isn't exactly a "Jaws rip off," but it's obvious that it was trying to exploit Jaw's success. First of all, Orca was, in my opinion, a bad movie, not horrible, but definitely not good, on average at best. The reason is basically a male killer whale (orca) after seeing his mate and his unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeking revenge. I couldn't stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this movie is poor, and in comparison with Jaws, it looks like the director, the producers and the authors were virtually non-talented. <br /> <br /> As far as the play is concerned, it was very average and credible, but the actual characters are not least similar. The effects were okay for his time, and the killer whale recordings looked good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is overdone and very loud, drowns out the sound effects and annoying at times. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales do not match only one friend as shown in Orca). In general, this movie was poor / poor in my opinion because of the above reasons. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge among animals and humans, so I will not bash this movie and I can understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for his concept may be a 5/10)
