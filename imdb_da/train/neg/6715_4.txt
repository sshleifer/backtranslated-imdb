I entered the theater in order to pass a pleasant 90 minutes to be entertained, if not illuminated. I left neither entertained nor enlightened. This movie can't think of what it will be and end up not being much of anything. There are a few fun lines and a couple of incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows - for this character? Get out of it!). While none of the characters are treated with great respect, the over thirty gay men get the worst of it: all predators, fat, sad, slobs. If you're in the mood for a homosexual movie, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. You want to thank me. <br /> <br />
