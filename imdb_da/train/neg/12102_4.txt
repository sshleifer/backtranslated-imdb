This movie is really just Bill Maher's interpretation of religion. There are several fun moments, and some interesting points, but don't go into this expecting a uniform discussion of religion. That's what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged in advance and in editing to give you the director's opinion, rather than letting you make your own decision. <br /> <br /> EDITING - It is very chopped up, spliced ​​with pop culture and media clips to enhance the point. The interviewee hardly has a chance to finish a sentence before being interrupted by the editing. The only people who get a fair chance to speak their opinion are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. When someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher, they are edited. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions. From the TV evangelical to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to a TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously a TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He has chosen the worst money grabbers, the heavy extremists, and those who do not have the budget to say no to choose. And when he gets a good person to interview, he edits hell out of them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Particularly hard hit are the Muslims. Under the Muslim segment, he gives almost no chance to speak until they interrupt themselves or through editing with pieces of suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as gun-toting extremists through editing, and none of the interviewed people are fairly edited. ENDING - The message at the end is incredibly heavy-handed, and while it's interesting idea, it's not presented with justice to the innumerable people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world. He also says that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the mistakes of the movie, it has some good points and humor, while very unfair, is actually fun. But by entering, it's a very one-sided view, Bill Maher's view of religion. He discovers nothing. He tells you what he means. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good moments but heavy-handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
