This movie is an insult to ALL underwater fishermen. It was stupid. It seemed to be written by monkeys. The action was absurd. If this is the attitude most people have of the Navy, I cry for our defense. This movie was horrible. I put it under "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" as far as submarine films go. Gene Hackman really should have needed to rent money to make this crap. Denzel Washington must have been tall. A little in the plot makes sense. And the end. For a memory to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this waste. If you haven't found out yet, I didn't like it. And if it wasn't for all pro comments, I wouldn't have bothered to post.
