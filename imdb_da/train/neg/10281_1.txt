Carly Pope plays JJ, a new-born food critic whose flamboyant, indulgent mother moves into her. JJ, horrified at this event, then harassing restaurant owner, Alex, to entertain his mother in exchange for "perhaps" reviewing his dying restaurant. Alex is predictable for the daughter while he warms to the mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2-dimensional. JJ is a self-service, hateful character, her mother superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The underlying message from an over 50 woman who is unable to do it alone, without male help is bad, bad, bad. The action is uniformly boring, the script is uninspired. The files that only save grace are the setting of New York City. I would NOT recommend this movie.
