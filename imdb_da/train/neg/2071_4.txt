I had two reasons to see this swashbuckler when it was broadcast on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She looked beautiful. Secondly, by reading about the film, I had the impression that it highlighted absurd humor, not contrary to what is found in Philippe de Broca's film. Unfortunately, on this account, I was disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks about the war) and the characters quite one-dimensional. The action scenes were also performed in a strange mechanical and uninspired manner without any kind of drama at all. I continued to look to the end, but I got bored very fast and sat right there waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
