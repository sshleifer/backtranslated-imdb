The ultimate goal of Big Brother that we know what to think before we think it has been realized. Is it a kind of miracle or creepy joke that people make mental straight jackets of their own will, twisting in distorted forms and laughing like monkeys? Film, art, no longer risk the unknown, but are exposed to conclusions that are drained of life. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a gentle storyline that fits a freshman college feminism course. Its lesson is schematic, right-angled, and linear: "See how women become objective, exploited, abused, and then thrown on the bin, by a male-dominated society." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, supposedly, was the "pin-up queen of the 1950s," robbing millions of men ejaculated. (All reviewers repeat this sentence, "pin-up queen of the 1950s", as a chorus of monkeys.) Her story as an American sex bomb is known: Southern, abused by her father, rape, etc. In this movie she is a na√Øve , an innocent ignorant of the wise interests she earns and shamelessly deserves. Although she believes in Jesus, she looks forward to naked before a camera lens - just the healthy girl-next-door sex-slave American men are supposed to fantasize. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of author-director Mary Harron himself, Oxford-educated and ex-punk (do you smell the combined root of privilege and "hipness" as I do?): "I feel that Without feminism I would not do this ... I do not make feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological, but I find that women get my movies better. "What a nice click. <br /> <br /> The movie only goes through the movements to tell the story of a human life, it is the subject and purpose that has been eulogized and interred well before the movie began. Mrs. Side has a girlfriend, but we do not see anything about their relationship. In fact, there are intimate or detailed conditions in the movie. <br /> <br /> One cannot ignore its slick simplicity. In New York, where Ms. Page tries its best to fit in and appetite a man's world so that she is tied in the rope of slavery and closely twisted in S & M's black leather boots and pocket, the film is black and white. But in Miami, where she walks away from it all, she pleasantly takes off her clothes and is photographed by a "liberated" woman, becoming the movie of color. As hell Harron doesn't "make feminist movies", "don't do anything ideological". Ideology has been so internalized, so assumed, so programmed that it is almost invisible. Big Brother should be smiling.
