Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar material, but with each release, they get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This starts with Seagal retrieved by the FBI because he killed a few people 'in self-defense' he is an active military so rescued from prison to save a stolen Stealth aircraft that will be used by clich√©s evil english villain "that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the movie is a horrible dialogue that almost always comes with a powerful topping of cheese and a lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting, and there are segments of it that make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story, the film's characters as a whole, such as the "lesbian" interaction between the two main women in the cast that is exclusively for titration. to get viewers and yet not even titillate just confusing as it doesn't make sense why it happened when it didn't need to. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible script with poor dialogue, provided by sub-parameters, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes and non-relevant parts that only serve to make it almost impossible and make the movie even worse. Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are Seagals most fiery fan.
