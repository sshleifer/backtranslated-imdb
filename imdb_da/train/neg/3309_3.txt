The reason, character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Quite a waste of time. The conclusion about saving Grace must make one feel warm and unclear as if the characters have grown through their battles. There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. Drugs gags are cliched and much of the film doesn't ring true to life. The reason is based on what needs to be tightened, but the signs are not developed enough to fit. Then rinse it through a resolution of all the outstanding issues in about one minute of the screen, leaving the viewer feeling that they have just wasted their time.
