This is one of the worst movies I have ever encountered, but I would like to say that some of the criticisms I had heard turned out to be unjustified. <br /> <br /> As far as pure film making technology goes, this director is competent. He is detained by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and stage station are quite professional. I've seen many movies where "directing" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there. Also the forest images contained a decent atmosphere. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera and he does a good job as far as the technical features go. As for artistic profit, there is none. The scene where the camera pounds down so we can see a guy urinating in the forest for 15 seconds is a kind of epitomizing the artistic style of the whole movie. This is pure waste ... Total waste. <br /> <br /> Gore is decent for a movie in this budget area. It is, of course, false but there is a lot of it and it is very outlandish. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with the sincere campy dubbing. It was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to do it through the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's overdone, especially at the end. It's really a horrible movie, but I have to recommend it for it's camp value. It is really hard to find a movie that is worse than this, and it puts it in a unique category.
