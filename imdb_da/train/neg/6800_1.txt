I just signed in to comment on how terrible this movie is. Besides being a rip-off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, it's the kind of movie that makes you happy to see a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they get such a silly, clich√©-ridden script to work with. It's bad enough if you moan once in a movie when you come across an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself moaning over and over again, you must conclude that the director is also not the brightest bulb in the movie industry or are the producers to decide to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The most low-key players can excuse you for taking on this task because they probably turned out to get the money and the exposure, not being part of this joke-of-a-movie, will earn them any prizes or recognition. It may end up embarrassing them to have such bad judgment getting involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even giving examples to prove my case, to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand. Like studying well-liked movies, you can inspire yourself to make a good, skilfully composed work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from looking at this monster is what NOT to do and what does NOT work! Be warned.
