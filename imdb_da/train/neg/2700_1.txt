Despite or perhaps partly due to the clever use of music to emphasize the motivations and ideologies of each of the great characters, stereotypes are inside, and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not-too-subtle movie scam. <br /> <br /> You get the feeling that John Singleton was dabbling in post-structuralist literature because it was today's taste, and "Higher Learning" was the predicament. The low point of the movie point is the "peace" rally, where the symbols of the "free love" movement of the 1960s are reused for what looks much more like a "Take Back The Night" rally with live, stubborn identity-conscious musical actions in tow. Perhaps in his prime revisionism, did the director attempt to claim that identity policy is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how Adrienne Rich of him ?? and Remy's firing in the crowd is a good touch if you are in Rich's kind of political attitude. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can only recommend it to those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the academic tragedy of race, class, and gender to popular culture and declared to hate "a viable and honest political opportunity". Where's Camille Paglia when you need her?
