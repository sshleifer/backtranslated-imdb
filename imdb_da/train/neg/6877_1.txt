I sat down to see a documentary about Puerto Rico and I ended up seeing one about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I can't see the 50% living in poverty. When I see fighting people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently come to the island. There is nothing like spanglish ... whether you speak Spanish or you do not .... and from what I heard ... you do not. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. To the rest he was loco like Osama Bin Laden. Theorists who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want some proof of all you dream of an independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, all of South America and Mexico. Its worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuyoricans and their battles. <br /> <br /> To the person who complained that was not enough of Africa was on the show ... it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will make a card for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... to all the ignorant white people who think we need green cards to come to the United States and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about Puertorican culture. Tell your kids to pay attention to Geography and History class. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if it were how we all felt. Should have gotten the title ... "yo soy nuyorican ... luncheon ... can't speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANOTHER OTHER FOR THE PRINT WITH THIS NEW YORK HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbids them to play this on the island.
