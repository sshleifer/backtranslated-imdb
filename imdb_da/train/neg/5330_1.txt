Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are only partially right. For me, this is the best movie ever made! I have never seen anything so basically raw and insulting and silly and against human nature as this movie. A real embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry, this is not even bad, it's good. There is no campy trashy fun to be here as in some of Elvis's other bad movies like Clambake. This is so messy to sit through its painful. Clean waste. Native Americans should sue for their bad clich√© and stereotypical treatment here. In fact, perhaps all people must be sued for the crime and disservice this movie makes to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. Degree: F
