This is the biggest flop of 2008. I do not know what the director has is his thoughts on creating such a great disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story has been stretched to fill the 3-hour gap and most obnoxious are the action stunts performed by the actors. It's as if everyone has superpowers, they can run in between the bullets is fire, and nothing happens to them and a person is fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was with Anil Kapoor man, he is always in his best way to play the role of villain with a cartoon that speaks Hinglish ... Akki has also done a good job .... But the film just forgets.
