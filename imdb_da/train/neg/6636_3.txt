Some of the worst, least natural plays I've ever seen. It may not be surprising given the lumpy lame dialogue given to the individual note-makers. In addition, there are cheap production values, and you have a movie that does not look like it belongs to the television itself. One does not expect much from a Lifetime movie, especially one this old one, but it is almost invincible. It is suddenly a terrible, clich√©d romance of a type that just Harlequin would consider under them. It is possible to guess how the rest of the movie will go by just watching the opening couple scenes. Surprise, the only female character that gets any focus and the mysterious stranger ends up in love.
