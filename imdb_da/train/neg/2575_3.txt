This really does not correspond to Cagliostro Castle. Lupine is not as funny or crooked or as hyperactive. The landscape and music are uninspired and the plot is just not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this "un" is nudity (only in the unprotected version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the boring scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set the film to some imaginative set pieces. The placement in TSoTG is not very vivid or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not provide a decent sideshow entertainment this time. It is as if they just fulfilled a contractual obligation by being shown. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including many trailers. But a curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or time code displayed on the player after it has been inserted. Although you can still jump to the next scene number using the remote control.
