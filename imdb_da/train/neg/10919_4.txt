Bollywood fans pretty much keep Amitabh Bachan's Mard in high regard, but I think it is very overrated. Manmohan Desai previously collaborated on films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, and I've seen them all I liked so I had very high expectations before I saw Mard and was bitterly disappointed. My main gripe on Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony Part 2, maybe Desai has jumped out of ideas, yet he had used this formula for years and years. 1. First of all, some members of the AAA casting are repeated, for example, the police officer bringing up Amar, the Muslim who brings up Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few more. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy loses her sight, in Mard she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sa baba) in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. I've seen AAA for over 1000 times, I've noticed it right away. <br /> <br /> My other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai makes your brain by the kind of movie, but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last gripe is that compared to songs in previous Manmohan Desai movies I found the songs quite disappointing. I know it has many fans who swear by it, but I didn't like it a bit. It actually makes me difficult to write this review because I'm such a big fan and have loved his movie since I was a kid.
