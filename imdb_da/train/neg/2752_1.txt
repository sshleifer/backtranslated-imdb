Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they are actually kind of good. Not this one. It was so bad I got angry. Seriously. A drunken 10-year-old could have got a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all, CGI was hardly acceptable, the scenes scenes were completely retarded and the little bit of history was there, it was just as he just decided: "I want this to happen and this happens, I don't care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever, I go back to my trailer to pick my nose if someone calls me, I'm not here. "Shame on what your name is is. Shame on you.
