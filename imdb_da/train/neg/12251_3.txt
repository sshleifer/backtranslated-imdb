Oh, CGI. A blessing when used correctly. A sin with it is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing badly used in this creepy Jaws rip-off. Okay, whoever read any number of my reviews has probably seen 2 things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a cute guy in the low budget movie, I usually point to them. So let's just get it out of the way right now. This is a low budget horror movie I didn't like. The action, for the most part, is horrible, effects ridiculous, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've seen this year. As far as the resident sweet boy ... Dax Miller (Book) wins the prize hand down. This boy is warm! And, surprisingly, he's not just a toned body with fine eyes and a sweet ass ... he can actually act (as much as he can in this evil movie). Now that we have housework out of the way, let's continue with that. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here's the story (don't worry, I'm not trying to give away) ... A movie crew member travels to a remote island to film a two-surfer documentary (established sweet boy and his buddy who are surfing with sharks. Unknown to them is a rather large saltwater crocodile lurking around the island. Croc shows up, chaos ensues, and people eat. Roll end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie blows pretty much. It started quite well, but soon became silly and stupid. A protagonist gets lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining gentlemen pronounce one-off people at the victim's expense. Also, if this hook is at the top of the food chain on both the ground and the water, what about all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, I don't think some skimpy sharks would stick. FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see. CGI is terrible and they even managed to turn up animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geography. Discovery Store. Croc Hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. Of course, you did not refer any of these judges to the monstrosity seen at the end of the film. And what about the pirate / drug pusher bands? Do you just need another reason to tear off a woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's fun how we get small subgenerals in the movie world. With Alligator and it's successors, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it now looks like "over-sized crocodile / alligator" movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper's Crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My character: D-
