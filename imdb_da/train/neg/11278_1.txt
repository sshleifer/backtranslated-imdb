This movie is simply one of the worst movies ever made and is a criminal accusation of not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. Not only did the movie get regular distribution, it also has a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I don't know, and I don't care to engage in the debate because the film was so horrible that it deserves no thought at all. Be warned and keep hell away from this nonsense. but I seem to write ten lines of text in this review, so I might as well elaborate on the plot. A nobleman of a man is set up by his evil friend and colleague out of his father's business and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and risky accents and stupid, very stupid plot phrases / units. I should have asked for my money back, but maybe still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime movie see the usual suspects or godfather, what about locks, warehouses ... it's the top of the contemporary British crime film .....
