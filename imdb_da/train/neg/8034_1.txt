I know that slashers must always be bad, but come on, what the hell is that? It's like a bunch of 10-year-olds saved their lunch money and started filming this at the end of their week. <br /> <In any case, six young people all go to the same house to be knocked off the screen. We have the fate, the sludge, the other blunt, the black guy, the killer, stereotypes like that. When you are eaten by a shaking boat, the others are stalked by a guy wearing a mask that the people in the poor box reject. There is a pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then it is back to even more boredom and especially more fake fright. we actually know that it cannot be the killer when a person is attacked because the guy probably loves to take his sweet time for everything. After every character you expected to die, the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon-to-love girl are eventually caught by the killer (they become like, pushed down and then weak) and the killer reveals herself. that the authors of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere in the list of characters. The subject is just lame and doesn't even make me start on the damn secret. Of course, Killer takes too much time to explain everything (and then in ten more minutes, cutting off his own arm for some reason) and eventually being overwhelmed by a guy with a gun. Hi, not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. I liked more about seeing a Lindsay Lohan movie I swear. I'm sure most of the 80's slashers also sucked, but at least they slipped into some T&A.
