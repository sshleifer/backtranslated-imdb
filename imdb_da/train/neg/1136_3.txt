Every thirtieth movie is dated, but if you only look at John Ford movies, it seems to be more dated than if you saw others. i.e. The Grand Hotel is relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always the hard sale of someone else's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always over-weighting of some tongue is evil. Always the poorly crafted, awkward and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a pretty preferred device to deliver emotions. And feelings are all this has. <br /> <br /> Which Ford doesn't make me understand Lincoln here, it just makes me doubt how the states were ever settled by the people of complete morons depicted here. Ford continued to make decent films. This is too dated to be anything but bad. It feels completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a false nose is bizarre. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the following "S" or say "Shonuff!"
