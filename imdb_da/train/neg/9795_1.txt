Come on, what about this show, Power Rangers anyway? I have always felt that the show, which was originally brought from Japan in a better shape, took what was amazing in Japan and became one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in the toy trade story! There is absolutely no point in this show at all. The bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings etc. show everyone what was ridiculous back in the 1990s From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to "duhs", of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: Give me a knee! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this from Japan and then Disney bought the rights to this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to endure resumes of this show on the Disney Channel and so on. All I can say is give me a break!
