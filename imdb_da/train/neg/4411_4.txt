Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has nothing to do except in a low budget film. He really doesn't have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has much more screen presence, and unfortunately he is not really the main character. Most of the screen time goes to the brick face Rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5 films) plays her daughter and she is sweet and entertaining, but she is written as not too smart and one of her stupid mistakes gets one off the main characters killed. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just seeing what happens to these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliar to the local Mafia Godfather, and it's hard to know if he's working the movie as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. He appears to be in every extremely low budget direct-to-video action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this movie made it feel like a spoof. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to tell some points. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The support of Thugs and Goons is threatening and well-molded. Some of these types of movies have Thugs that look like they work at the local comic book store or as a store girl at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall, this film is very uneven. On some points, it seems like a comedy or a parody. So on other points it works like a good action movie. Then it spits to an end. Without the contribution of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this movie would judge a zero in my humble opinion.
