I saw this know almost nothing about it, except for the brief description I read here. After seeing it, I was originally supposed to say the director shows promise, but seems to be amateurish, so I looked at the other things he did to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He kind of missed the mark on both films and it was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was also quite awful, could anyone just fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed at the end, but overall, this movie is pretty awful.
