At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought-provoking. Of course, when something provokes, it can be scrutinized. The reality is this film combines metaphysics with initiation and basic conclusions. The link that "What the Bleep ..." will see you between science and spirituality is actually not rooted in science at all. The transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation from a group can reduce crime in a given area, Washington D.C. in this case. In fact, the HRA (Homicides, Rapes and Assaults) crime was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime between 1988 æ‹· 1992. There was absolutely no fall in the murder during the investigation. In fact, every requirement that connects metaphysics to science can be debunked. My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a bad attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. In any way, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a protracted film about science that can provoke thoughts, consider Mindwalk (1990).
