This video guide was the masterpiece in 1995. Beautifully finished! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have larger on-screen chemistry when talking about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a Special Edition DVD, complete with deleted scenes, Bill Gates commentary, a documentary about how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP, and more! <br /> <br /> General: 10/10 (Must have won at least one Golden Globe)
