This movie is a waste of film stores. Do you think the map of a military mission plan will be placed on an easel on a courtyard in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this movie. Do you think a DEAF person would actually be dedicated to the active working group in Europe during World War II to serve in a "Negro" unit ... cooking, utilities, funeral services, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you think a black (and apparently intelligent) officer would choose the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active fighting mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the Allies arrived? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German aircraft is approaching from behind and would punish and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers holding up a barn at a farmhouse that the Germans were doing would separate their feelings out of the German soldiers who were only 50 'away? They did it in this movie and left any entrances to the barn, the Germans could check completely unprotected. Would you believe that the captain of the air waves and in German English mentions the rank of the general, if not his name, as the person he spoke to, and that the general in English on open air waves said the dam should be protected the next day? Maybe they should just have sent in an emissary to tell which direction the US attack would come from just to make it a little easier on the Germans. This so-called movie must be placed on a list of the top 50 worst movies. If it was, I'm sure it would do well. See it at your own risk.
