The movie starts slowly when we got to the cinema, we thought it looked good, but after approx. 5 minutes we were all bored out of our minds and wondered what kind of movie we had come to see, I didn't like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home. This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, we were all bored or minded and most of the people in the cinema were actually out of doors at the end because it was so nonsense. I'm surprised nobody went out earlier than that. If you go see it, make sure to keep yourself busy, better still not go and see it at all.
