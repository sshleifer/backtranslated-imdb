A young boy sees his mother being killed, and his father hangs out. 20 years later he gets a lot of friends together to do an exorcism on himself, so he will not appear as his father. All stock figures are in place: the lovely couple; the "funny" guy; the hard (but sensitive) hood; the wise girl (she wears glasses - that's how we know); nerd and two non-personality blondes. It all involves some stupid wooden statues that come to life (don't ask) and kill people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a big opening scene, we jumped up to 20 years later - ALL bad horror movies do it! The dialogue is horrible, the play is bad (except Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) And the killings are stupid and / or imaginative. My favorite scene is when two people seem to have sex and the statue knocks the guy out of bed to show he is completely dressed! A really bad, silly incoherent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
