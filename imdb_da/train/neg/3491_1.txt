Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box do not have to look at this so-called "movie". They described "blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence." I saw no "intrigue". Instead, I saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no "violence". At least I didn't see anything that could make me suspend my disbelief about what could hurt a man with "impenetrable" skin - but here I might reveal too much of the "plot". Furthermore, as the authority of many and different films (some of which include occasional kung fu films), I can say that this piece of celluloid is rigid. Whatever you choose to do, I will always remain <br /> <br /> Correct, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. I was not blinded by choreography.
