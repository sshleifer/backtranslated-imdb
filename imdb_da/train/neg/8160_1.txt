and not in a fun way to see. It's just bad. It's shocking that people have written positive things about this. the story sucks, the play is bad, it's not scary, special effects are not special - oh no! the board has hands coming out of it! Oh - the mirror turned into water! The hair, clothes and makeup of the 50's scenes are not correct and they got a medieval man with a retreating hairline to play high school version by themselves. this is like later nightmare on elm street stuff. I enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else, but there are better bad ones out there to choose from.
