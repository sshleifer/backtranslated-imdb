First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and she's just awful. This movie has all horror move cliches in fantasy, and all badly played. Chained teenage couple. The comical (not) horny jock. The lumpy, cool chicken. The spooky local color guy. Parent-type couple. The virgin chicken that amazingly never dies in these movies. The dialogue is so painfully awful and comes with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you want them all to die earlier. I saw a hard piece of this movie a while ago, but somehow it just got worse. The fun, the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but it hardly gives a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
