<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes in this television series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend, Horatio Hornblower's super human infallibility destroys any chance of excitement. <br /> <br /> When Wesley Crusher destroyed many seasons in the NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower incessantly saves any situation. Every smart solution inevitably comes only from Horatio Hornblower's lips. In fact, simply superior, Hornblower's biggest problems in this series of films seem to tolerate the many flawed characters above and below him in command. A perfect being makes for boring storytelling. So superior is our hero that even those who try to help him are powerless to do anything right unless Hornblower is there to control and control their every move. What's the point of telling a story about someone who can't do wrong and will repeatedly win everything every single time? What is the purpose of seeing such a story?
