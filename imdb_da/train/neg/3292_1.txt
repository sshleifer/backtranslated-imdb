For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I start with the bad. Bad point: Cast the selections (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), the act of the poorly selected cast, storyline, the idea of ​​setting the movie in modern times, the direction, editing, soundtrack and above all the idea of ​​making a feature film Out of a television series that wasn't so good to start with despite it's popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ........... that's it! <br /> <br /> You can make an analogy here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke steps up to Michael Weston like Enos, and asks the question, "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", In his overcast judgment, tells her where they are. maybe just as well, "Enos, is this a good movie?", the red bikini would have flooded his sentence to say yes, even though in his right mind he would have said, "No, not really." As good as she saw in bikini, she could have been sharp naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making. Get out of Hazzard!
