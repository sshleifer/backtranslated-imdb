No spoilers here, but I've been a fan since Waking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far, are horrible. The stories have no resemblance to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw falling ridiculously. As the BBC license pays, after the show, I called BBC complaints to forward my disappointment. I am surprised that actors of the caliber Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not protest against the story. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost in every direction. It's a good job, it's the last series, or the next series can begin with the team examining Father Christmas's death! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
