Miraculously, it is actually quite easy. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad - it's devastating - my life is bad, it's so bad - it's mildly entertaining badly. Yes, there is probably little praise. The production values ​​are rat over the table, the play is scary, and the Romero-Wannabe satire can't imagine which side of the organic fence is mocking. Internal logic takes a backseat to heads that drift out of refrigerators, virus incubation times vary as the plot requires, bullets work against the zombies or not, zombies that have spoken power or not. Gore is the drawing, of course, but the frame is so slapdash it is annoying. The dialogue sounds like it has been translated by the same computers that lack instruction manuals, and the extent of the zombie attack is implied by none of Romero's inventiveness. It is completely topped with a terrible synth score. Absolutely nonsense.
