It touches a few interesting points .. But! - It does not show all the "exclusive" surveys shown. Who are 'friends' and 'small groups of researchers' who gathered this data? - What happens to all of Alore's biography going on there? Like how he liked to play with the cows at the ranch or that his child was hit by a car .. too bad, but .. what does it have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I've seen VERY better things in much less time on the Discovery Channel. I really don't understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you've been living under a rock, this "documentary" shouldn't be any news for you ... all this is old news ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is get some popularity points. P. S. I'm not American, so don't even try to say I'm a bush fan
