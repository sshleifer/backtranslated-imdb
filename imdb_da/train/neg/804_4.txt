I rated this movie a 1 because the plot is so incredibly incredible. Judge for yourself. Be aware that the following will not only give away the plot, but will also ruin your appetite to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, designed by a frustrated geek, sends a code through TV screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye, it can access the electrical system in your body. What it does forces the body's cells to excrete calcium. Within seconds of infection, the patient comes to the throat, develops tunnel vision, his skin turns white with calcium, and then falls and his hand and curl will break into a chalk cloud. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When it is found that a blind computer sample tries to separate the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set to very high voltage, causing severe burning wounds on the expert's head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately, it could be stopped by throwing out obsolete desktop PCs in a tripod and electrocuted geek with the backs of a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water. Oh dear ...
