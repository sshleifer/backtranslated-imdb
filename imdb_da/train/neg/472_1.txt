The only thing I can remember about this movie is two things: first, as a twelve year old, I even thought it stunk. Second, it was so bad that when Mad magazine made a parody of it, they stopped after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page that said they had completely rejected it. <br /> <br /> To see great sophomoric comedies of this period, try Animal House. It is so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself into high art. Another good choice would be Caddyshack, the classic with late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray, before he became annoyingly charming, with beautiful lines like green goalkeeper Carl Spackler's "Correct Me If I'm Wrong Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers, I locks me up and throws the key.
