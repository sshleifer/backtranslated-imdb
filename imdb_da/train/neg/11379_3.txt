When I first saw a small scene of it in some messages, I thought the show was entertaining to watch. The little robot guy looks a little cute. The animation style seems to be known for some classic shows. Before the show was broadcast, I studied it through some sources. There I was a little horrified. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are pronounced correctly, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "What ended up with Robot Jones?" The view is not bad really. But the way Robotboy is inappropriate portrayed is my only criticism. Thus, I do not see it much.
