Trying to compare or represent this "swill" as a "Hitchcockian" is an out-n-out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans into wasting $ 7 on this movie ... Weak action Weak history Weak script. <br /> <br /> No real voltage, no voltage. You wait all the way through the weakness of this movie for the big payout or even any payout ... You're back to thinking what that was all about. <br /> <br /> Please, move with the movement to make "alternative lifestyle" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can't recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the actor is? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But they were much more innocent times ...........
