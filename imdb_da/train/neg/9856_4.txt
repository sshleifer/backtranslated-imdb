In the autobiographical everlasting tale "Romulus, My Father," Eric Bana, "Munich" fame, a poor German emigrant plays to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural areas of the 1960's Australia. The biggest obstacle to family stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding ceilings by shameless shelves with other men. Despite her very unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give her a divorce that masochistically tortures herself in the vain hope that one day she will return to him. Unfortunately, it is the kindhearted and good-natured Raimond who must testify to all this civil unrest - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita will later grow up to be an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, my father" for what it is trying to do, I cannot honestly say that I enjoyed it, because while the film has some fine ideas and serious intentions, it goes, these are simply not enough to counteract dour history and funeral pacing, leaving the audience as desperate and depressed as people on the screen. A serious piece of life's drama is one thing, but this tireless downward weakening in adultery, madness, and more suicide (let alone suicide attempts) is another thing.
