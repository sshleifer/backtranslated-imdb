They show this on some off-networks. It's good shit. Although not as bad as the B-movies, they appear on the sci-fi network on Saturdays, but still a rather large pile of crap. The action is acceptable. The reason and writing is quite sub-standard and pacing is way too slow. Every minute in the film feels like the part of the movie where they pack things before the credits - not the top of the movie, the denouement. Also, large parts of the cast look too old for the age group they play. It is all predictable, boring and not worthy to be seen. Save your time. It's not even worth taking the time to see it for free.
