I enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than I did the movie when I saw it at another round of theater in the early 80s. I was so impressed with the care taken to create costumes that were so well-modeled according to the Tenniel drawings. But for me, the cast was largely wiped out, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I seem to be unusually static, and the photography creepy. The rating rejected at that time was nothing, which means "not worth sitting through even once". <br /> <br /> Still, I would hop on a chance to get a different look.
