This movie is shoddy-made, unoriginal garbage. I like romantic comedies sometimes. Seeing a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you have to do all the time, but the experience is so comfortable you can ignore how unwise you are. This movie made me think about how stupid I was to continue to remain seated for the entire time. Everything about it screamed on the cheap. It actually looks as if they over-exposed the film at certain points, it is so washed out. It boasts cheesy CGI and lame sets. <br /> <br /> The script was lumpy. I know you can usually expect some plot problems in a screw basketball comedy, but you don't usually break because you're laughing. This movie is so unfunny that you are actually sitting there wondering about the unlikely number of coincidences and utterly incredible behavior involved. Events were placed in the movie just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to give a description. Sure, that's how all movies work, but you shouldn't notice that it is happening. Inelegant. That's the expression I need. <br /> <br /> There was hardly any in the movie that was really good. I didn't care who ended up with who, as long as they all stayed away from me and I didn't have to listen to them, talked about it any more. Why would the only really cool character in the movie, the Paul Rudd character, have anything to do with the totally bitch, discouraging, control freak played by Eva Longoria? In addition, almost all the people involved consistently chose the most difficult solution for any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years, just to hang out (and bathe) with a woman he is attracted to? The best feeling-good moment they could come up with was tackling a happy end for the same schmoe, where he joins Rudd's just annoying lie, kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they will find something better to look in the way.
