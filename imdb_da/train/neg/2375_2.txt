Freddy is dead: The final nightmare, the sixth part of the Elm Street series nightmare and yet another bad sequel. I think it's tied up with Dream Child's last successor. I was fortunate enough to get the nightmare on the Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday so I got to see all the sequels. May I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed, but with these successors, at least the last two, it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It's almost like the authors tried to give Freddy a soul, and they just ruin it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that was not necessary, sorry Robert Englund, but it was much under what Freddy Krueger represents. Freddy's back, but he has something we don't know about, a daughter. Maggie, she does not realize that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She must do her best to resist her strength, but it is difficult with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, isn't it? But Freddy doesn't give up without manipulating her into his ways. Freddy's Dead: The final nightmare is also featured in 3-D, radically, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst followers, it is tied up with the fifth successor of the Elm Street series nightmare. I'd rather see the second nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had bad action, stupid editing, and just about all a bad idea for a story. I didn't like the concept of it, and it just ruined the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not Far Knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
