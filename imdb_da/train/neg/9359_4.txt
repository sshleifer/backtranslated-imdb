This movie is probably pro-muslimisation. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing it? The protagonist has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he apparently is a Muslim because of his headgear that he has kept his amulet and his general clothing. He has a six-year-old child wearing the same headgear and therefore probably a Muslim, even though his mother is a Christian. The protagonist thus chooses to be Muslim, and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male protagonists who are Christians seem to breed a child. There are several Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it, so it works.
