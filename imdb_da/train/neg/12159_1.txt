I can't believe I actually saw this, but I guess I just wanted to know if this movie would be inadvertently more fun and fun towards the end. And it did. climax was the worst performance ever given by the defense lawyer - so out of real life, even for a fictional story, it was too strange. No way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did. and probably the worst accusation on earth. Why was he still in court? He did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty. a simple search in her house would have resulted in the discovery of the rings. But don't go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times throughout the trial - that was it. The blonde lunatic was given a means of truth to prove her innocent, but not Brett. The lunatic had almost Alter's Alter in her home that could have proven her sick occupation. But again don't go. during the cathedral I felt the silent urge to take the needle tip out of her hand and bang it several times against her head. Even real strangers do not see the stupid false "I am innocent" as she did. And what does this movie tell us? never married a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs, her husband is thrown into prison, guilty or not. evil, evil men.
