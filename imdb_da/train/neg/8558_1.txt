This movie was horrible, I feel uncomfortable and call it a movie. Its the typical "mumblecore" movie, with zero plot and a bunch of rippled whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to "figure things out". I've been trying to give mumblecore a chance, but don't be honest, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> I'm not in sync with the cinema, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, the Idiots are one of my very first favorite movies. So I don't care if a movie is made cheap, as long as there is some (something) substance. Everything in this movie is horrid, acting, writing (or was it all impromptu?), The direction, but most of all, above all else, the camera work was just plain and simple fog. The camera was never logical anywhere, there was no connection. I have to admit that I was a guy I had heard there was nudity in this movie, so I was thinking of myself even though it is horrible at least there is nudity (yes I know I'm a dunk). Well, thanks to the uber crappy camera work, you'll never see anything and the things you see, believe me - you won't see. This movie made me throw up at many levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me throw up, the camera work made me want to throw up, but mostly the idea that this movie was praised by some legitimate critics well now that more than anything gets me to vomit.
