I wasn't as "lucky" as some of the others commented on this movie: I've never seen anything else ... let's say ... "fecund" mind of Sarno. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time for topless and (go-go) dance are not very attractive. I liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so homely, she was sweet! The action was rather outdated, but even though the delivery of lines in another language could have counted much of that problem. Trying to follow the plot was an important task: was there one, really? I totally agree with another comment: For a vampire movie there is not much blood. Yep, if you want good blood sucking flicks, check out such Hammer classics as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Brides of Dracula". <br /> <br /> The most (unintentional) humorous part is how a lady doctor gets her clothes off with a cloud of bats ... as you never see! ... the bats I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay as a time waster, if you happen to catch that cable here in the big white north, but don't rent it for heaven's sake!
