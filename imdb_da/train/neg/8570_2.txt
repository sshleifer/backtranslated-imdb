There is only one thing that is crucial to the thorough understanding of the Indian runner. Unpack your pants. Look in. Are there signs of a Y chromosome? Okay, you must. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the male demands: blood, weapons, car gates, dear women, death, more tattoos, cigarettes, spirits, violence, pyrotechnics - what have I left out? - Oh, yes, blowtorches. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I seriously hope Sean Penn sees it as a "when I was a kid ..." a little effort. Since he both wrote and directed the case, he is almost solely responsible. A bumpy throw (Viggo Mortensen as usual demonstrates excellently how the job is supposed to) tries to save Penn. Too late. The lines and the action are there. Even devoted, accomplished plays cannot change them. I found this movie pueril and stupid, as well as predictable. The dialogue stays together - Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe into a tree-nut monologue with no maternal authenticity. Then she dies. Gradually, the protagonist's father, Charles Bronson, also plays. Their absence is hardly noticeable. <br /> <br /> At intervals, the pyrotechnics appear. To experience and intimidate the audience to believe that something significant occurs. <br /> <br /> If you are male and under 25, you can love this movie. Planning to return to it at 35. Think you still like it? <br /> <br /> I don't think so.
