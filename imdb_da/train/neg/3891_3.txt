I think my favorite part of this movie, the one illustrating the pure meaningless, stupidity and stupidity in the case, comes to the top of the movie. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend The Sheriff has finally turned Melting Man on landing on some stairs in an electricity production plant. Remember that Nelson has been looking for MM for almost the entire movie, and that MM has killed and eaten more people at this time (including his boss), and Nelson is very aware that MM is fierce insane and hungry for human flesh and blood . <br /> <br /> So the sheriff has his gun directed at MM, who is, and I give the movie and Rick Baker props for this, the most obnoxious and scary object in human form we've ever seen. And he calls out a very important question to Doctor Ted Nelson: "What are we doing now?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera cuts over to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it is obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so appropriate to the problem of finding the merchant, he never thought to bring some restraints, a lasso or a tights or a net or some quiet darts or perhaps a New Age tape by Vangelis to reassure the savage beast. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panic and shoot, melting man goes crazy and hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has turned around the space trial in the subspace of the last 30 years instead of going back to the moon or out to Mars, as everyone knows they couldn't be. I am not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's the kind of miserable, lazy writing and direction that submits to every aspect of this movie. It is difficult to say how well the actors are, because the film has completely disregarded their characters. Two other incredibly painful sequences also hit the stupidity of the procedure: There is a scene with the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn apart by the merchant. This scene is a nadir in the 70's cinema. I can guarantee that you have never seen a more meaningless and annoying set-up with otters who see people throughout your life. And the assailant's assault on the lady who lives in the house, where they hold a horse sitting on the walls, can tolerate any attempt to treat it. (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathon Demme has a walk-in in this scene as a redneck man who enters first to check the house and never comes out again). The only thing that keeps the actor from chewing nature literally is, as I said, their horse has apparently looked at it. And we are forced to watch her hysteria for at least two minutes longer than any SANE movie director would hold. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should crap out IMM's director and photographer. I remember him from an old Columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here - no idea of ​​a senior man, but solid and discreet. But no one could possibly be so uncomfortable in real life that his instructor made him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone else gets a little better except the old couple (and stop, I know they were playing for laughs, but I don't laugh!) but not much. <br /> <br /> This is certainly in the category of "Biographical Disaster" so bad. I will still see it again before I see many other 70's and 80's abortions ("The Moonbeast Track" and "It Lives By Night" coming to mind), and MST's coverage is very fun, so if you get One chance, see the MST version.
