I rented this on DVD and I feel bad when Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about it in the DVD comments. It is not a bad movie exactly, but it is one of those films that desperately want to be a deep comment on human nature, but do not realize that its history is practically a genre. Plus, it's a bit simplified about the problem in many ways, and the characters' behavior often stems from faith. I would say it is a movie that you would get something out of if you didn't have much movie / TV / literature / life behind you (for honestly I am almost exactly the same story in horror comics though). Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. And that comes to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much cinematic interest in it beyond the point. It ends up being a rather bland movie that collectively invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and convincing, and it doesn't pay really well.
