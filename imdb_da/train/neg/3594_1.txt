This is not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, horrible acting and annoying music. If you only see the trailer then you probably know ... It's a shame that such things are available on VHS or video, while there are so many good movies inaccessible. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or the Italian gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. It's masterpieces if you compare this to this bin. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
