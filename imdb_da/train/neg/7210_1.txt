Once again, Disney manages to make a children's film that completely ignores its background. About the only thing common to this and the original Gadget cartoons are the names. The most sharp mistakes are the characters - Penny doesn't have his book, Brain has been reduced from a sign to a fancy prop, Dr. Claw is more a show-off than an evil villain, etc. But there is more to it. Fears start from the first minutes of the movie - having the Gadget as a security guard called John Brown does not help identify him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And right at the start, we see Disney's blatant attempts to make every story ever a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, who only serves to make this movie Disney-compatible. Add to this that "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr Claw is almost diagonally opposite, and you will see that this is going to be nowhere near the original story. What would help would be a better story to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney also failed. The whole movie is just the gadget that seems silly for the silliness sake and lusting after Brenda. As if adding disgrace to the damage, Disney introduced the "new" gadget mobile - it doesn't look, work or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical "comic relief" figure. Disney, of course, acknowledged that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the movie a comedy, but they took out all the clever running gags (like the release paper exploding in the boss's face) and replaced them with the Gadget as a moron, the Gadgetmobile is a clever-ass, and "Claw" appears. Someone should tell Disney that "children's movies" does not mean "total lack of any brain consumption". The gadget should be targeted for children aged 10-12 ... not children 10-12 months like this movie. No matter what this movie should be, it is NOT, repeat NOT, the right Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old gadget, I hate it here.
