Having been very entertained by Mr Brosnan's performance as a cad in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I judge 10/10 across the board: casting, acting, scripting, history, editing, tempo, music, emotional consequences, etc.) .) I enthusiastically expected this movie. I was very disappointed. It's a script that doesn't read a movie, vulgar to be vulgar, bankruptcy in every way that "The Tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen to write and control. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part" it never came. I also didn't laugh and cried, even though a dialogue line made me smile. Worth $ 7? Almost.
