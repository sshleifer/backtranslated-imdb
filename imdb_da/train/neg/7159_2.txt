I thought I would never find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but this movie competes with it. I'm not someone who sleeps when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up and started to see it agian. Why did I deserve it? The whole movie was a torture, I have to use fast to see it complete. <br /> <br /> I can't stand why one of my favorite actors from all the time (MR WALKEN) could do this. I have to think that he did the director a favor, or he really had money because movies after the movies he makes, he destroys himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the movie? It's not scary, stupid plot, signs are terrible (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), the effects are very poor, lack of death and blood, etc. in three words it has something. And I mean it. I can't understand how a director can make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was more disappointed, when I looked in the video tape, the movie was presented by "Stephen King", I think he could never present this crap, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I do not recommend it for a million years. I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my "Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre" review, there will always be a worse movie, that's why it doesn't deserve a 1 in 10)
