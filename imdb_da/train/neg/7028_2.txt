Somewhere between Food Court and Zip is a mall in this movie <br /> <br />. This is the only place the title character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb he plants in the mall in the boring final. <br /> <br /> A fictional city has a new mall, built on some countries it was <br /> <br /> condemned. Cute girl (I didn't get her name) gets a job like <br /> <br /> waitress there. She lost her boyfriend in a fire on the spot, where <br /> <br /> the mallet stands. The scabby mall owner hires the arsonist <br /> <br /> responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security <br /> <br /> vaguely end up being dead. Rob Estes, eons before "Silk Stalkings", is a <br /> <br /> photographer / reporter trying to find a story. He is associated with Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and their common "fun" friend Pauly Shore, and tries to find out if Eric <br /> <br /> is still alive. He lives in the basement basement (?) And travels through the air ducts and postpones various people who disturb his former boyfriend, including the arsonist. Finally he kidnaps her <br /> <br /> and the final involves the bomb and all run from <br /> <br /> the stage before the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is together for <br /> <br /> ride as mayor ... yes, she is mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably didn't need a plot sketch since the whole <br /> <br /> story is in the title. A person named Eric takes revenge on <br /> <br /> people as a phantom of a mall. This also means that there is no <br /> <br /> voltage. We know Eric is behind this, but we still have to see Estes and Cute Girl going through the movements of a silly study. <br /> <br /> Look like Fairchild we know has been in cahoots with <br /> <br /> mall owner all the time, pulling a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of <br /> <br /> a crowded party, but no one says a word as she leads them to her <br /> <br /> office and her eventual death. The fictional city is huge, but a policeman is ever called, all relying on the agency's security for orders. Eric has been hiding since the mall was built, but I am not sure <br /> <br /> where. He seems to live in a basement area, but you would think <br /> <br /> any construction worker would have found him. He also <br /> <br /> furnished his love cushion quite well and found some outlets as he <br /> <br /> has electricity. It can be nicer than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both of you note. He tricks a security guard out of his cabin by moaning the camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, here you will see a grain <br /> <br /> black and white shot of Pauly's south coast, although it is not weasel. <Br /> <br /> This is just undesirable and evidence positive that I am hiring only <br /> <br /> about anything in the video store to stay in the horror section. This <br /> <br /> movie is not Eric's revenge, it's the filmmaker's revenge for me <br /> <br /> to be stupid enough to see it. Here's my revenge: I don't want to <br /> <br /> recommend it. It will show them! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, some weapon violence, make, <br /> <br /> some ghosts, some female nudity, short male nudity, and some <br /> <br /> sexual content.
