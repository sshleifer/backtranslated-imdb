This is the first time I've ever seen a movie with Jamie Foxx and I bet it will be my last. I couldn't see why he was funny, even though people in the audience thought it was a lot of fun when he made a face for the camera or to say "I'll have a shower". <br /> <br /> Plot is absolutely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman so the bad guy uses her. Meanwhile, the officials are screwing up. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't work your home to solve a trivial puzzle? <br /> <br /> There is no big play that is not much of a plot or story and the slider is finished MTV style. Don't waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
