Most college students find themselves lost in the academy's bubble, cut off from the communities where they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and college faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focused on a small group of people portrayed representing large groups of the population. As is common, the screaming peoples get the most attention in the media. Aside from its misrepresentation of the society where the film was set, the documentary was well made. My only dispute is that the emotions and rebellions depicted in the film were attributed to the whole community rather than the few people who expressed them. Of course, it is important to investigate a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political views, but it is ridiculous to include a whole community of people in some radical actions.
