I agree with everything that people said about this one, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WORST thing I've ever heard all my life! There is actually vocals in times when you have to listen to the actors' speech! And the vocals are like a broadway version of Danzig singing, "The darkness of the forest! Oh the darkness of the dark, dark forest!" or something else so unpleasant. The singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthetic strings and fake drum strokes. It's terrible !! <br /> <br /> Yes, the male leaders are terrible. Then they are female. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! All they say is about being a man or a woman, just playing the stereotypes up to the maximum. Make me sick. Sooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The kids were so echoing in their lines, you couldn't understand them. And why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair, beautiful blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair? Not scary - STUPID. Daddy's face was too immaculate and clean to be for a man living in a cave. Beautiful beard and forehead, pa. Did you perfectly cut them with a knife yourself or did you go into the city and went to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
