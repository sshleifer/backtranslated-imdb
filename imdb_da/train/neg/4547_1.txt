The movie was awful !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last few years. One of these movies I will be able to tell people in the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to the burning question "What is the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and was thrilled to see the movie, but then they treated the audience as if we were received. There is no story, and the story there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. It's too bad that they have to spell out the nine prophecies and cannot simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. They didn't spend any time on character development, and it was easy to be indifferent if any characters died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people stuck to the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is also boring, but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while reading the book. The movie does not give the same opportunity, and I do not suggest seeing it if you want to keep the book's words close to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
