Not only did they get the signs wrong, not only the voices sucked. Not only do the authors have a serious need for having lovers. Not only are the drawings really raw, but it seems that it was mainly created in ages 1-6. The only episode I have ever seen on this show that kept me watching was "A Mattter Of Family" because I liked the Robin character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, yes? Over a two episode story, he transforms into the unlikely villain TwoFace. In "Show" Bruce is friends with the Ethan guy, and over a two episode story, he transforms into the unlikely villain ClayFace. It was just a small example (it can't even be true), but in short this is the WORST attempt at a Batman series. And that says something.
