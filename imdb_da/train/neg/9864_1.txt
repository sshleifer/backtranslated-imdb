As a gamer, I can't say I like this movie. The fact is, I down right hate it. I tried to see it as openly tuned as possible, but when it comes to that, it feels a little offensive to my social group. <br /> <br /> There are several reasons for me. <br /> 1. The signs seem unnatural. I have met many players, of all different societies. I don't know anyone who works like any of the characters in the movie. It's like the film's producers have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. Most players are social people, some with fairly active lives. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The mockumentary style is poorly suited to the subject of the movie. An actual documentary about players would actually work better. While it looks good (ie, just joined together), it's not that good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack a real world context. Players swear I admit it, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. The humor is missing. Although self-destructive humor is a mainstay in my group and several other groups that I have encountered, this is less self-devotion and more like toilet humor. Likewise, a great deal of gamer humor is full of fun and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most players would beam and avoid anyone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: accuracy. I don't mean rules, but instead dynamics. Still, this movie will be compared to the even lower budget film The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both portraying players as actual people playing a real game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat players indecently against The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Huh, I know a guy like that ... Yeah, it's definitely like Gary."
