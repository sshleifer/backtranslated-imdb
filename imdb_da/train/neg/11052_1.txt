The Deadly Wake is the perfect movie student movie ... to learn how to NOT make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what shot the crew in this flick? Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script BEST ALL-TIME DIRECTING Worst play Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst sentences Worst lighting etc. Let's see if this "movie" had been ultra-high contrast black and white and silent ... it would still have been terrible. All scenes are dark (the lighting of people calls it "black"), often the music has scored the winding dialogues, which was OK because no one ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. The "evil" robot was fun ... what was that? Jazz Dance? Oh ... I suppose it should be tactical or something. I'm sure it hit fear in the heart of the poor editors. And, how do you edit so much of the recordings of waste? Not possible. Waste is garbage, no matter how you split it. How has anyone ever got it through the dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is - I couldn't stand to see more than 15 minute segments, it was so bad ... but I saw whole things (with lots of breaks) just to see if it had any good share it at all. NIX! DOES NOT! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a girl ... one should watch for every serious movie student !!!
