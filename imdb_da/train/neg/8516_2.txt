Last week I took a look at the weekly Nielsen ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you don't see". <br /> <br /> Well, they're right you're not seeing it. It was broadcast twice and ranked 147 and 145 out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest rated show on any national broadcast network ... and deserved it. I tried to see it a couple of times because of all the press coverage that hung it like a "big" show, a "realistic look" in life and all such nonsense. The reality was otherwise. Veronica Mars is a bore. It is as unrealistic as it gets and it deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is why CW felt compelled to put on its initial schedule the lowest rated show in memory, after two years of continuing commercial and artistic failure.
