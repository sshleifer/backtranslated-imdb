and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the author had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize that every single thing he wrote was cliched and hackneyed and was parodyed to perfection in movies such as "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialogue ever written. Stupid "we're going to prom" junk. I wanted to clear my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There was really no reason to make this movie. The leading lady is uninteresting and I continued to think "Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the square in teams of 2! Front and back! Not a sleepy policeman sitting in his car, with the window rolling down and waiting for his neck to be cut.) The serial killer is just swans about killing everyone he wants without the slightest problem . No resistance from victims (or doors). No one has any protection or the slightest idea of ​​fighting back (or turning the security lock on the hotel room door). People are like mentally handicapped sheep. <br /> <br /> By the city, if you are a gore fan, you will also be disappointed. All the killings are kept offscreen and are - ahem - tastefully finished. (So ​​boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the killings are least interesting. Most of the time they have already happened when we find out. <br /> <br /> The only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movie. "Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then at the end, when it's time for the killer to die - well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Lace up. <br /> <br /> The audience shattered and talked back to the screen throughout. It was too stupid to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy movie production. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and by the way - no crown prince king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) <br /> <br /> Save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th "or" Halloween "or" Scream "or" Scary Movie "(any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
