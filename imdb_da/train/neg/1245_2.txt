Absolutely the worst movie yet by Burton, which seems to get worse with every movie he is leading. A miserable script with cliches is only the first of many offensive aspects to this movie. That's the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shouting "he's lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is really awful and it is Wahlberg who can't play it right and be convincing. Very nice effects and photography, but bad music in the John Williams shadow of Burton's crony Elfman. Heston appears in a nonsensical scene to play its most famous catch from the first movie. Very poor results. <br /> <br /> If anyone out there also saw "Sleepy Hollow", they would have noticed as I have, the falling quality of Burton's movie. I have heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was introduced as a director, in which case his judgment should be questioned. But I think he has allowed every possible vision he might have previously had in his career to slip; The proof is there in the movies. In "Sleepy Hollow" he could not decide what kind of movie he made, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the people of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) Also got you thinking it was kind of monster rally movie (They are never scary as horror fans know). The movie could not succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. "The Planet of the Apes" is very similar, and the result is more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than as sci-fi. He has also fallen on the edge of so many other "big" directors to try to satisfy the entire potential audience. Words for Burton, if you are out there - choose something and do it right, or use a style to separate it all (as in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you might as well retire because people like me who are fans of your movies will stop going.
