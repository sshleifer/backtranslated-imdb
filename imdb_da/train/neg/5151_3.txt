I thought it was a good idea, but boys, it was badly executed. We get a broad sense of how complex and challenging backstage operations on a show are, but almost no specifications of any of it work. The producers do not seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a "consistent". (It is not to say that they did not try, but having the stage winners relate to a connection in the ring cycle, as the program's narrative does not do anything to tell us about the work of physically mounting an opera.) <br /> <br / > We see many things happening, but are told a little about what people are doing and why. There is little sense of who is who or how the different production departments fit and work together. For example, we hear several times about a problem of some sort - one expects to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is solved. But instead, the filmmakers generally only cut for something else (generally speaking, there are generic images of people pushing things or talking in the headset.) On the whole, the film ends more like a pastiche of images that you would see running under the Final credits of a show, rather than something worth looking at for their own profits.
