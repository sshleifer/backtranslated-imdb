OMG this was the most painful experience in my life that looked at this. I could even finish what happens to Nick. Their best thing about teen Nick is Drake and Josh and it's about to get out of the air. The children's songs are a little annoying and so are the kids. My little sister wanted to see the show because she likes everything that comes at Disney or Nick but after finishing watching this show she said "one of the worst shows I have ever seen is so boring." My little brother actually fell asleep, I envied him. In short, if your 3 year old without brain activity you will enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now.
