Saw this on DVD in original language with English subtitles. Either the subtitle was very bad, or the actual dialogue does not make much of the story and gives some character development. There are very few HK stars in this, but the film does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes performed in CG are attractive to the sheer colors and shine, but it can be overwhelming before long. If that's something, I get to think of a child's movie with its nonstop cg, combat scenes and crap plot. I'm sure I understood what was happening in the movie, but the whole story of the story was pretty miserable.
