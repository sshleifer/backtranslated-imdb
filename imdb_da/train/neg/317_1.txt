This must be the worst movie I've ever tried to see. For the first 15 minutes there was nothing to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at that time and had plenty of time to devote to one just for fun movie. The condo we stayed in had this movie in stock - they must have got it from $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, it's not like any other movie he's made. This started with a bad premise and got worse. There is nothing, however, extremely fun in it. <br /> <br /> I've seen many movies, including some I didn't like. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.
