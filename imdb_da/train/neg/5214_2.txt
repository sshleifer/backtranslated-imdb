METAMORFOS I work my way through Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of "Atom Age Vampire", which also included a scientist striving for similar results. Seen in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to break the human genome to create a serum that prevents aging. Printed by the administration to publish its papers; and produce some results (or risk losing funding), the researcher decides to use himself as a guinea pig! By first believing that he had no negative side effects, he finally discovers that the serum has really changed him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The play is stalked; and the performance left me with a much smaller interest in the film. The result is pandering. And the science behind the experiments and their results is not only false; it is absurd; that's ridiculous ?? at best. <br /> <br /> As others noted, the end becomes a 30+ minute gag, which seems to be endless. Without giving too much away, I would call this, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet with the creation of the black lagoon that meets at home alone."
