Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors provide decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. The notoriety for his charity, a drug addict and a guy who, despite entering AIDS, continued to make adult films, just doesn't make an exciting sign. History surrounds the events leading up to and the pursuit of an evil mass murder that occurred in the late 80s in Los Angelos, which Holmes was associated with, arrested and accused of murder, and ultimately acquitted. As in OJ, the fault factor regardless of the result was very high in the "He did it" area. There is no one to sympathize with in this movie, which is all a self-serving criminal. There is just nothing externally interesting here.
