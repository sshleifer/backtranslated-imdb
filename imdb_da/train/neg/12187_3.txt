Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this terrible terrible violent overburden. Scorsese is completely out of his element in this movie with horror clich√©s suddenly loud phone rings and door slamming gimmicks that seem ridiculous and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. Cast is completely wasted here and southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone! The Niro's psychotic Bowden is no more than the typical 90-film shooter. The scene with De Niro and Lewis early is very awkward, and climax continues and continues, and we should all be more than tired of the psychic stalker who never dies. One of my most horrible movie experiences. Rent the original, it's 100 times better. <br /> <br />
