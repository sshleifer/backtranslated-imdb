Never see this movie ... it's the biggest pile of sh * te I've ever encountered in my entire life. And that says something. acting, history and filming were absolutely bleak this is the WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD !!! Seriously doesn't it give you a chance as it cost my 99p from sainsburys, and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to see it, you should see the "scary shark scene" ... possibly the best piece of play I've seen in my life ... ha ha. i seriously think this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours ever !!
