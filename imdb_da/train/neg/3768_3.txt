It is true. A movie written, directed and produced by Fred Carpets and family. (Fred should have known better when he had worked with the Titantic and Dogma sets.) <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are some scientists, and some forest cruisers and a hot chick with big fake breasts. They are all really bad at their jobs, including the hot chick (which I think should be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the forest cruisers says the researchers are "professional people", which is good because it would be terrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They wander through the woods in search of some strange monkey-like bones, and no one even mentions that the bones may just be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one of the rangers hits tremendously on hottie. We all hope that he will die very soon (along with his sister, who is supposed to be the sweet naive, but is really just annoying). Then they find, * gasp *, a Sasqu ... I mean, Ape-like Animal Burial Ground. Of course, it doesn't mention that it might just be Bigfoot bones they are messing with ... I think scientists and woodcutters just don't think about those kinds of things. <br /> <br /> So Sasquatch and his tribe become really angry and kill all the people we don't like, chase the other losers away and bury his great aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) again . <br /> <br /> Insipid, boring dialogue (I speculated several times), inane plot, unlikely signs, bad CGI (a man in a monkey dress would look better) and acting it just wasn't that good, everything together to make a movie, I will not see again. <br /> <br /> You check it though; It's good for some unintentional laughs.
