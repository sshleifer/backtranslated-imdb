As a fan of science-fiction movies, I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. From the little bit I will allow people to tell me what I thought was very original and sophisticated. I'm also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released. With the forthcoming release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy the DVD and watch it. <br /> <br /> The disappointment was too great. The prerequisite for the matrix (the controlling unit as opposed to the film) was clever. The philosophical premise for parallel worlds, alternative realities is shopworn. But I could still have bought into the movie, as science fiction, if it got stuck in that genre. Unfortunately, it became a standard, "they will or will they escape, break through, save those who need rescue, etc." To make matters worse it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts movies are really two different types. For the purest, one or the other devotion works that the two do not work. It's like mixing science fiction with romance. You can have one or the other, but not both in the same movie or at least not both in the same movie. <br /> <br /> If there were such issues with The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded really worsened the issues. At least 30 minutes of the movie was either martial arts sequences or the long-standing car fight. (This observation ignores the question, made in every professional negative review of the movie: If Neo could do Superman things, why are you even bothering to fight? The answer, of course, is what pulls the young male demographic into the theater.) there "redemption through love" aspect. This plot unit was worn by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. It was actually better handled by him in Die Gotterdammerung. <br /> <br /> So where do they leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded. Martial arts fans probably moaned through trite, but arcane sci-fi philosophers. The fans of science fiction wondered why they were sitting through a king's party. Most of the men in the audience are likely to be bored with the silly romantic aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What to get for your money when you watch The Matrix franchise movie: Science fiction, martial art or soap opera? A bit of each does not do much more of either of them, nor of a satisfactory movie for each afficionados.
