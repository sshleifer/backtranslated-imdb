This show is not smart. It's basically what it boils down to. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to pull to avoid completely biting the rest of the world's bushes is just unfunny. In another comment, someone quotes a few hilarious lines. Standout for me was George H.W. Bush tells the kids that they should not watch any television besides Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a highlight of the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with drivel as this sad excuse for political satire is that these people get another season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush has not been a good president. We all do that. But it's no excuse to put out this totally poopie waste of time. I place these authors on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula bites off so many already unfunny topical jokes that you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself written credit. Again, just simply bad. Involuntary and it just makes me more and more dissatisfied that crap like this is renewed, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons. Please do not see this shit unless you are one of the green blooded liberal hippies who believe that any sentence with the words Bush and stupid is comical gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice stinks. All he does is mimic a Texan accent and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits the votes are not correct. If you want fun political satire, see the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for political sketches on the Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch as stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done. Look for George Bush as a Jedi piece on youtube. Priceless
