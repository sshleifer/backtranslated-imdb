I've seen about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite type) This movie is among the worst. For me, an idea drives a movie. So even a poorly traded cheaply made movie can be good. Something strange is certainly cheaply made. However, it has little to say. I still don't understand what the karate scene at first has to do with the movie. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
