I'm a big Michael Madsen fan, so I have to buy this movie without renting it or anything ... This movie was so horrible, I didn't even go back to the store, I didn't want anyone else to be exposed For this human poison, I just threw it in the garbage, don't remember the money, it was worth the price to throw it away. The action wasn't that bad, it wasn't good or anything. The story was horrible, and the end was something I despise. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. his life was a lot of junk. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a horrible device to show his childhood innocence, a dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this end undoubtedly angered me. Jesus heals everyone ... I hate that I know people like here, who are great Christians and Catholics, and time will tell that God does not heal everything or anything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the opportunity to watch it, pass it or better buy it or rent it and throw it in the garbage, and let it coffee in the morning
