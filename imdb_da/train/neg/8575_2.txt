****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> The unfunny radio quiz show has been Kyser and his mediocre band is the excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to retrieve a paycheck in this bland sporadic apparently haunted house spoof. Lugosi is a mystic whose sanctions are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to overthrow a heir's happiness; Karloff is butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes false media, but it turns out that they are both in conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his band of 30-year-old "kids" reveal the truth with the least possible humor along the way. Not recommended to anyone but the absolute horror completist.
