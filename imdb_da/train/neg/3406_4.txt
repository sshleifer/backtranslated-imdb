Space Camp, who had the unfortunate luck of being planned around the Challenger accident, deserves luck. "The stars" make a scream of plays, Lea Thomson is actually turned sideways when asked for more than her usual, wide-eyed innocent smile, presumably suppressing her risible attempts. The movie is sometimes fun when it starts asking too much of you. A little boy holds a multi-million dollar robot in his closet that breaks when given too many commands of hordes of kliched dorms. This hackneyed and unlovable machine, "Jinx", is an important player in the film's ridiculous premise, which appears in the Short Circuit, part 2001 of the aircraft team. I'm not going to drill you with this, it's enough to say that you can only laugh when you face it. Having said all that, it is fun to see, in a SeaQuest, hidden by the Bell kind of way. The romance and technology, beware, are as incredible as each other. Also, if you are an eighties in the 80s, it is harmless to Kate Capshaw's entertaining performances (Willie from the Temple of Doom) and of course Lea Thompson. Also, Joaquin Phoenix puts in a dizzying trip like a kind of wannabe Goonie who is friendly with Jinx. Do not go near this movie if you are not a waste bin fan.
