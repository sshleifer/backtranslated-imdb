That's what I found myself saying over and over in the remarkably innocent third act of this apologetic excuse for a movie. First, the effects of the computer are completely insane! These computer wizs really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though ... None of the characters work in a realistic way, especially in the aforementioned contemptuous third act (I promise I won't give it away, but believe me it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the movie come unintentionally, as when trying to explain that an invisible man's eyelid does not work. Please give viewers more credit than that! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. What would you do if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt with much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man of 1933. In particular, there is a scene of violence that is so incredibly ambiguous and not even mentioned later. If more attention had been paid, Kevin Bacon's crazy scientist could have made a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The movie would actually be much more successful as a porn because the assumption could actually be made in a unique and interesting way. But this job ... go see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
