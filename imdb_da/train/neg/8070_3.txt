This is not a very good movie, but it is not a stinker either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I figured this movie out (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is actually quite simple when you remove all the confusing unconscious dream-state junk (95% of the movie.) <br /> Ignoring unwanted what really happened is this: One group of school friends going to a rave one night. They leave and come into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. It's the simple cut version. (That's right, I said Sean is carrying me) <br /> <br /> Right after the accident, Cassie is in the hospital, stuck between life and death until the end of the movie. This is where the dream drug starts. <br /> <br /> The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the accident has interacted with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 odd and Judas) along with pictures tainted by her thoughts (Sean, school, and everything else around her). Souls continue to do what they were defined as: Annie the rave chick, the 2 weirdo-killed (from the opening scene), father Jude still helps people, etc. <br /> <br /> We are then taken on a lot Long trip, shown many pictures (many of which my GF and I still can't tie in), but it all boils down to it's not Cassie's time to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is the reality again. She's okay. <br /> <br /> Then the instructor adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream piece of her in the wheelchair being choked. But this part is really just a nightmare and she wakes up next to Sean, who of course still deals with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to room restrictions, we did not cover all small things, but it was free to send us an email if you wanted. <br /> <br />
