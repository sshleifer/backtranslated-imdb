Slashers ..... well if you like horrors, it is definitely one to see, otherwise don't even break. Clearly, this movie has an extremely low budget. For example, it looks as if the whole movie has been shot in a warehouse somewhere, and in many cases you will see the mike boom shadow and camera shade, believe me, you don't have to look for them. Also, try to ignore the cheesy actors if that's what you call them! are a few people decide to go on a show where they have to survive one night in a large maze because they are 3 kills on it loosening and whoever lives is getting rich at the end. Now there's something about this movie that keeps you looking and rarely do you find it with a cheap budget fright these days. For example, when I looked at it, I thought of myself, I didn't want to go into this game! especially for $ 12,000,000. so anyway i recommend you to see it and make your own mind.
