Ten minutes worth of history stretched out in the better part of two hours. Since nothing of any significance had happened halfway, I should have left. But, ever hopeful, I remained. And left with a sense of guilt for wasting time. Action was ok, but the story is so transparent and weak. The manuscript is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out ten minutes plot does not provide much room for good dialogue.
