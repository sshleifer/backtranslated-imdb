I saw this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to the back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know people are going to say that prequel was made on a small budget, but it never had anything to do with a bad script. Now, maybe it's just me, but I've always thought that a prequel was made to put the other movie up for starring and maybe fill a little about life that we didn't know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has Carlito's name. There should have been at least a few characters from the original movie, the end does not make sense to the original. At the end of this movie, he goes back with his sweet heart, but how in hell do we get him out of prison in the next movie? And his woman is not even the same woman as he speaks of as his only love in the original. I would say the movie is mildly entertaining in itself, with a few decent bits, but it pales when held up to it's big brother. Don't be awake at night and wait to see this, see the original one again if you really need a hit.
