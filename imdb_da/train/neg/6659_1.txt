During the first 3 seasons, just as strange parents were as tasty as hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's just as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you need after seeing the latest episodes, where all sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that results in no laughs. Cosmo, which is once one of the more inviting Nick characters, has become an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of Family Guy would not even know. Timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would happily turn out of (and given Timmy's snottiness that would take much to beat). And poor Wanda ... a real charm that has been the victim of her husband and god-god, she is now labeled a "nag" to care for the welfare of others. Plus Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he is never punished for it, and he also teaches no lessons. Which basically summarizes Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are raw, vulgar and not too bright. Thank goodness this crummy toon has been canceled along with Butch Hartman's treasure, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
