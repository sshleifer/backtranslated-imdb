Probably the best woman in the show business and the sexy, Debbie gives another good performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this movie. The cast is filled with your typical Melrose Place types, chiseled features and seductive curves that I had never seen before. Apart from Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had ever seen in the same Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a group of California arrogants who embark on poor naive Debbie Rochon in their clips. They tell her they have a murder club and that she has to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie no longer wants to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group has to decide what to do with her after she fell for their joke. VALUE: $ $$$$ (Really! Debbie Rochon has occasionally splattered the blood over her and all the murder scenes are finished in your face. Gore dogs will definitely enjoy!) NUDITY: $$$$$ (Plenty too! Debbie Rochon has several naked scenes, like many of the unnamed actresses and actors, the pool party seems to be an excuse to get all naked, both men and women, Julie Strain also has a topless cameo, but her characters are gone after the first five minutes) . STORY: $$ (Could have gotten a higher voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a filler between naked scenes. I understand that B-Rate movie often uses nudity, but this is cross-border). <br /> <br /> ENABLE: $ (The action is substandard, at least. Rochon is always at reat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the company today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does it good work as Debbie's favorite item, but the other actors were nothing to write about).
