I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was looking forward to this. I was fascinated by the company's pre-hype descriptions, its narrow submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the Treks we are used to. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything interesting in this pilot. I found the plot to be confused and confusing. <br /> <br /> I would admit that I liked some of the character developments - human depictions as a "youth" species ready to grow their britches were entertaining. <br /> <br /> And the volcanic babe had a hell of an incredible rack. <br /> <br /> But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series. <br /> 3/10
