This movie is entertaining enough because of an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is lovely. But the reason why the film is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. I haven't read the book A Mother's Gift, but I hope Britney and Lynne Spears blame it completely different from this movie. Unless you are considering ending a movie with what is actually a music video, an original idea is that the whole movie will think of the word plagiarism.
