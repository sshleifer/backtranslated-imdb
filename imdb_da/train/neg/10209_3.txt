Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder City Numbers a shot. Though decent in sudden, self-destructive roles, Mrs Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) gives much to be desired. Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused and sexually incorrect. (Sandra's past complex comes across as an unnecessary filler that does nothing to develop its already low character). The two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensic expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude are despite stupid mistakes screaming "We did it!" Chris Penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here, as does Ben Chaplin's token partner / love interest character. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre behavior, the biggest mistakes can be traced to a TV-of-the-week plot that has never been completely bought in the killing motifs in the first place and which mentioned are the stupid mistakes (vomiting of a rare food on the murder scene, an overly comfortable and framing of the school's guardian, the two boys hanging in the public, a convenient love of interest to cause friction, etc., etc.) are shown to be from being intrigued to being bored and disappointed by the murderers. The end was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. Using the classical tactic to almost display the climaxing scene at the beginning of the movie and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surpassed none and lack any of the so-called intelligences that the film claimed to reach its conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost every way. * out of ****.
