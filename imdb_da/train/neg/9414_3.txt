Despite the recognition on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than other war movies in the period to portray the mud's sludge, boredom and frustration, but unfortunately you get away from what thinks it's ALL for this movie. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie must have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films from World War II, "Twelve O'Clock High," has very little action. But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of G.I. Joe" is a short battle segment (titled "The city under siege" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. Admittedly, it is one of the most rapid and convincing battle scenes of any war movie. But unfortunately the rest of the movie is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another deviation is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is supposed to be a "romeo" but comes out of a pervert. In contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, if inadequate man. As he says to Capt. Walker (Mitchum), volunteering for another patrol: "Every step forward is one step closer ... to the home." But the last step ?? a patrol for many ?? runs him over the mental rim. Too bad does the rest of the movie not fit for some otherwise fine details. As for Meredith's portrayal of Pyle ... it is practically comatose.
