I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am middle aged, the old one for me is a movie made before 1970, when most were made in the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was amazing. I could reminisce about the stories there, but I really enjoyed the monster in the box history with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. All stories were good though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good, and who was bad, the horror bites were enhanced with a close-up of a face horrified by fear, and the funny pieces were really fun! This successor lacks either these elements to a great extent, or they are completely absent! I write this only after seeing it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing, you tell something ..... 4 out of 10. Also, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must have told him to tone it down to a PG standard (I don Don't know what this was judged on, but it looks PG to me) and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else. It appears on the Encore cable channel if your door (yuck yuck) to see it.
