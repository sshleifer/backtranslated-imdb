First, I was convinced that this was a movie for television that was not worth the primetime. But after a few minutes of stupid awe I realized that there was at least comic value in over-the-top stunts and c-movie acting. This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I hadn't laughed as hard as we saw that the actors could hold a pretty face. It was like a less fun spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much, I actually bought Big Hit DVD) with even worse plays. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim, after all those hugs and tall. A few rooms and cokes will definitely help it go easier.
