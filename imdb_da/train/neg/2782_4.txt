I just watched the movie last weekend, I'm sorry and disappointed with it. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring all they can with them from the old country and invade and take over what Americans have worked for. It's a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way to tell people about it. It is the most important. Another thing, the general writing, directing and filming is on par with village amateurs. The actors did it pretty well, but it wasn't up to them, so scared this bunch of shed. A couple of jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. Couldn't wait to get out of the theater, want my money back.
