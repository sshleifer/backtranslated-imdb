To begin with I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Although the 'naked mile' and one are the two worst, this seems to be the decline of the entire series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the movie was that it was an American Pie movie that is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> But there are tons of bad things to say about this movie. First of all, history has a very outdated 'arch' structure. First, there is the introduction of the signs, so the pledge of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of them has exactly 25 minutes length. Apart from the general silence of the plot, there is little or no sign development, making a double whammy of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I had deeply rejected the stereotype of this movie. It is to show jocks as the extremely cool, only think-about-sex guys, and explicitly show geeks as subordinate. It also shows women only as sexual objects, and men who only want to treat the females as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the play was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a generally horrid movie, if viewed from a critical point of view. If seen from a teenager's point of view, I guess it's better, but this movie is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't be seen by minors.
