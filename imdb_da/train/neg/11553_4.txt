Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm sometimes after directing "Apocalypse Now" that made him totally incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" was thinking when making this flabby movie. It gives Kathleen Turner a star-driving vehicle, plays a woman who travels back in time and is allowed to restore her youth, and knows all the things that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, the troop that she is, does what she can do with it, but this movie could not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even have any style to it, and considering its instructor one would expect that even if it had nothing else it would have. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
