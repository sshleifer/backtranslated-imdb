STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Long-term partner Twitch (Kurupt) gets transferred to a harder prison than the reopened Alcatraz. He claims it should be closer to his lady, but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a big prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch is despite being less muscular, just as oral and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang-war brewing between the black and his Latin inmates exploding into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black band leader shot dead and the finger points to Burke. But sh! T really does hit the tab when the real murderer and head of the Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's boyfriend and Burke's daughter case. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not succeed (supposedly much in contrast to the idea of ​​under siege 2 and agreeing only to do so provided the movie company he was with at that time makes his own movie) So, although this is a DVD sequel, this time, Bill Golberg is going to lead (Steve does not even come in some of the first films coming to the end.) But there is a reason why he has not done much work since Universal Soldier 2, and that is because he is not much of an actor and not much of an action star either, to control a character that begins as very dark and brooding, but unjustly becomes a standard action hero, scary looking out of boring one-liners. Support wise, veterans of the first movie, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have only jumped on the chance of extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has tried to copy the style of the original quite well with dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music much about it. It does quite well, unfortunately it cannot be contrary to an unengaging hero, a straight cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the creators seem to have made when they walked together. **
