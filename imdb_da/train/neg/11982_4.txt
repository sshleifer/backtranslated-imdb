In 1925, childhood friends monitor Marie Dressler (like Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (like Lizzie Praskins) the wedding of their children, Anita Page (like Helen) and Norman Foster (like John). Before the celebration, Mrs Dressler turns over her little town bank to her son, Mr. Fetus. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bankruptcies and financial uncertainty. Banks Foster is able to survive because of Mother Dressler's clever planning. But Mrs Moran is concerned about her happiness and loudly calls for a complete withdrawal. Other customers from "Warren Bank" hear Moran's rant and start questioning their own solvency. Soon the family is in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> Dressler's huge critical and economic movie hit "Emma" was released early in the year and MGM would have wanted to get a new Dressler movie out as soon as possible. Dressler's 1931 hits, "Reducing" and "Politics" still made a lot of money; and Dressler became the 1932 US # 1 Box Office Star, according to the industry standard list drawn up by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy and hurried. The cast does well, considering. Something more care in direction and editing, and some resumes would have helped ?? Apparently they needed it in theaters for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
