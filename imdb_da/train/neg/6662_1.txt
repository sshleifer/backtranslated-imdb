* Spoilers and extreme bashing were ahead * <br /> <br /> When this show started, I found it tolerable and fun. Easy Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with SpongeBob. But it began to fall because of the following crap, which Butch Hartman and his team pushed into the show. First time, the toilet humor is not that fun. You can easily grab a quick laugh from a young child with a burp, but it's basically the only audience that will laugh at such a clich√© joke. Next, there are kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people across dressing. Lololol !!! I just can't stop laughing with such joyful happiness! Someone help me! But of course this show wouldn't suck so badly if it wasn't for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed the Australians? They saw them as other than kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons living in a warm desert. But now ... is the coup de grace of why this show really sucks the highest of them all ... OVER-USED JOKES !!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (most of them are unfunny) that seem to be the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly the culprit. I hated how they continued to mention "Super Toilet" (which also has a mix of kiddish humor in it as well) and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget the stupid battery joke that every parent's parent in Dimmsdale would use in one email episode? Do you know, one, where every parent (unaware of other parents saying) would pronounce the NEXT same sentence before breaking into their child's room? Yes, it can be first class humor to some people, but it is purely s *** to others. <br /> <br /> If I am not mistaken, I think Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone around my area says it's the funniest Nickelodeon show ever. I just can't agree with that ?? I think it's just another pile of horse races we get at our cartoon stations every day, only worse.
