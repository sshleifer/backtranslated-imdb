This film introduces quite a few signs and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them generate any interest or positive response. I waited for the plot to begin, hoping things would get better and ended up sticking to the bitter end, but there was no reward for doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me, the action is not worth telling. Not that the story was so bad, I think you could say I had some problems with the script - ie. I thought it stunk. A look at the credits will show you that there is a beautiful strong cast here that is used to no avail. Most of the old benefits in this flick do good jobs; of the actors I had not seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. It's all about what I find good to say about this image.
