As is often the case, the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films add up to nothing more than unclear stories. Like Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are bred as nasty wild dogs who carry out their masters' bidding. The protagonists, an emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who matches an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, at the end you lose track of who you should empathize with, not to feel even the slightest feeling for any of the men ?? Whether it was the director's mistake or perhaps the stressing message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the movie's beginnings were filled with intrigue and unpredictability, the way point it struck down to a humble story of survival and revenge. The excitement that was first evident disappeared quickly due to a roughly inconsistent musical score that brought down the potentially effective storytelling. And in the end, you were left to feel that all the detailed background information and introspection of the protagonists were somehow unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, was the transition in history from point a to point b rather atypical to American movies? So those who are not familiar with Asian movies and tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance appeared throughout most of the movie. It was like looking at a picture shot on fluorescent as it had to be put on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it strained my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you? An interesting structure gave me hope for the slowly moving story until it was redirected to a low budget, low speed hunting scene. And just when you think you'd get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespeare tragedies, you realize it's not an end to something, but rather a transition to a crazy country music montage about peace and ro. <Br /> <br /> Throw some grisly from behind chokes scenes, an insoluble moment unexpectedly brought back to savagery and back again, the Asians' fascination with body fluids and a terrible music score that didn't match the movie, and you get the average gentle Asian thriller . <br /> <br /> I just don't understand why every battle situation was overlaid with clipping of roaring lions? I thought they should symbolize dogs? In the end, we eventually become reminded of a true killer who still lurks among us ?? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
