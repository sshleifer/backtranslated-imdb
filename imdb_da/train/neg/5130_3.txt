Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her dissatisfaction with this film and calls it, among other things, anti-feminist. She also said on her radio show she hates making "romantic comedies" because she doesn't believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This movie is at best a trifle. She does her best, but in general it was just another boring, incredibly "romantic comedy" that has no foundation in the real world. While there will be some who will "suspend your disbelief", you get tired of having to suspend it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. Janean's character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look attractive while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which is probably dissatisfied with Janeane and probably one of the reasons why she rejects this movie). It really hurts the movie if we have to buy the premise that Janeane should be better on the two. As many have said here and on other commented threads, Janeane is not ugly, but actually quite beautiful. I haven't read a review where someone said Uma was looking better. However, when I have said that, I think Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely be with Uma, not Janeane. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really smart men) and unfortunately Ben would probably have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it doesn't work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway. I think many Janean's male fans who are obsessed with her as this movie because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character and actually score with Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role Janeane is best known for, and it is a shame as it really is not so good for a movie.
