This movie succeeds in being one of the most unique movies you've seen. But it comes from that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems like a series of challenges created to determine if you are willing to leave the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel weak, you will sit through this horrible movie and develop a true sense of shame for the actors involved, they have all seen better days, but then you realize that they have actually paid a lot of money to Do this and you will lose pity for them just as you have already done for the movie. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, it's almost something Ed Wood would have made, and in that case it would probably have been his masterpiece. To start, you have to sit through an open dialogue as those you have never seen / heard, this thing should be five minutes long. In addition, it is told that you can see that the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr Slater and the blockage of terrible lines is starting, it is as if he is only working to get lines on the movie poster roofline. Soon we will meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy), and he does his best not to drown in this, but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid plays an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and in one way or another she gets roles in movies, in my opinion she must stick to movies of American circus type. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can just see this yourself when it comes to video, I know I got a kick out of it, I think everyone is honest here, sometimes it is the comforting to fear in the shortcomings of others.
