No wonder this was released directly to DVD here in Australia, with no redeeming features ever. The dialogue was hokey, the actor, horrible and the script sucked !! Anyone who thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel or follow up on the very superior John Badham movie, the Wargames of the 80s, may well have been on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it as the eye candy / love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other main lead-that's about it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out Hackers or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this piece of shit !!
