What can I say? I am a secret fan of 'over the top' action and horror movies. Especially when it comes to lots of humor and insinuation, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. There are three possible features for this movie: ?? Comedy of the situation; ?? Horror; and ?? The news of hundreds of snakes is of an airplane. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not written as a heavy-in-kind fear or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you will smile at yourself. If you want to make the movie feel the movie, the trailer represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Second, if you expect a movie full of action and shock, you won't be disappointed. It doesn't stand out other movies, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, though the novelty of Snakes of a Plane is not worn out, but you want to let the cinema think "what was it all about". <br /> <br /> I know this movie has a high rating but it doesn't add. A) Many of the reviews written before the movie was released and B) The breakdown of user ratings has much less variation than usually 77% of the people who assess the movie 10/10, with only 7% of those who gives it 9/10 - Why such a huge hole?
