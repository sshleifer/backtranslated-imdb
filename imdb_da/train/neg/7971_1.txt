I'm not sure who writes these <br /> <br /> glowing reviews for this movie, but trust me on STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and slasher flicks and this is LAME it's only about 80 mins long and believe me that's all I could take. The reason is horrible, the action is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even the David Cocteau movies are better than this. Drive away from JIGSAW. I expected to hate the play, which can be forgiven directly for videos, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> This had no scary, very little Gore, <br /> <br /> and a really unattractive cast. <br /> <br /> I saw this with three other friends <br /> <br /> I still hope to talk to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to flirt out the window. I can't believe anyone could have <br /> <br /> given this tripe a good review.
