I must admit that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, from me he gets "no respect". I only saw this because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without real humor. It's full of lame, raw jokes and a completely ridiculous plot that revolves around a developer's (Dangerfield) plans to build a Utah ski resort that just doesn't catch my attention at all. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Dangerfield movie, a weak cast, including the likes of Andrew Dice Clay, stared all the way over the John Byner hill (I didn't even know he was still around until I saw his name in the credits for this This is really a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
