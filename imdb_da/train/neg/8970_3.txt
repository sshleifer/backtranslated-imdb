The first Cube movie was an art film. It set up a world where all the great archetypes of humanity were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they could not understand. It was on the non-literal plane a "human vs. cruel nature" plot, where the person who represented innocence and goodness eventually came and triumphed to see a new indefinite world beyond the human calves; a world where there was no more struggle but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never supposed to have any sequels. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube, was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the case of the original movie, both the story and the setting were not sensible and had no meaning. To be quite entertaining I rated it a 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the other, plays as a very subordinate commercial B movie rehash of the first , sense symbolism. There is no "tribute" or "tribute" here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot, with some elements changed idiotically (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say). <br /> <br /> Seeing something from "behind the scenes" means nothing because viewers are just part of the great bad experiment the architects we don't hear about. And in this movie, those who come through to the end (which Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - how * the wave * is in it? It's just flippin 'stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​and performances of Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get a rating of 3 out of 10.
