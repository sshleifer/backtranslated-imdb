Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is ridiculous to throw him as a fun romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, croons so effectively, and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem the more creepy. In his more sharp moments (with the girl in the station, in the final number with Rosie) I couldn't take his eyes off him, he was so offensive. You continue to expect him to release the nice guy action and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the right star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. If you see a production of the stage music, the 1963 movie and this movie from 1995, you can see three versions that have multiple revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.
