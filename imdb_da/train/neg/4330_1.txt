Last night I decided to see the prequel or should I say the so-called prequel to Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power" (2005), which went directly to DVD ... no wonder ..... it totally .. .and I mean S% & KS !!! waist of time to see it, and I think it would be a pure waist time to write about it .... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh # t party in a movie. ... except just one fact that I tip my hat to ... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante .... reminded me how De Niro entered Brando's shoes to portray the young Don Corleone in the Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro was fantastic and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez, he is good at trying to be a young Pacino .... too bad for him. I don't think he'll play more in movies and, by the way, after watching this sh # $% movie, I sat down and saw the original Carlitos way of getting the bad taste out of my mouth.
