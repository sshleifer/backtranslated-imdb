First, I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen. It's not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, it's just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. Went to watch this movie expecting this movie for me a Transformers with dragons, thoughtless entertainment. Everything we got was a thoughtless hour and a half. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so horrible with the play, it did. It's basically a Chinese haul that returns every 500 years ... Sounds like a good remake of rain of fire? No, the plot tries to be deeper than what is to be abandoned, not just plotting holes, but with magic and a very small actual war between dragons (rather large snakes) it just becomes ridiculous. The director tried to add some humor to the movie, which fails. Me and my friend laughed through it all (along with all 5 audiences) and can't believe we spent money on this. The short trailer on the TV is for the most part the action, while the crap does the rest. I've seen many B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say if you want an uninterrupted laugh for an hour, watch this. <br /> <br /> History: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> I don't drink ... but it would have helped before I watched this movie
