This is the kind of movie I fear most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it presents a sketch of Colombian conflict so clumsy and stupid it represents an insult to all Colombian people. The performances are godawul, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who looks straight out of a Tim Burton nightmare), to Díaz, who makes a remarkable effort to bring life to a character such a -dimensional, so cliché and so poorly written, is all he has left to work with, a mustache. Not to mention the gratuitous end, a gore party so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood cringe. It fails in every way, film, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing, and most of all, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a miserable filmmaker, but at least his former film had some dignity. I can't say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope that Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson on honesty, integrity, and accountability from this average failure.
