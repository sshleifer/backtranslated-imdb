The reason for Descent, if it can actually be called a plot, has two remarkable events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events make up 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean everything) between them is basically the director's desperate effort to fill the protocol. I like to disturb movies, I like dark movies, and I'm not alarmed by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy / dark (literally) scenes with no story you have another thing there coming. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is totally wasted here. And no, she won't be naked, not even in the NC-17 version, as I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to see "Descent", take a nap instead - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
