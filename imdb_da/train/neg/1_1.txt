Robert DeNiro constantly plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate. This movie is so wasted by talent, it's really disgusting. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of its own and not a fun thing. The film moves at the snail's pace, is photographed on a poor advice and is insufficiently sermon. It is also connected in each clich√© in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supportive role, but so what? <br /> <br /> just as annoying is this new IMDB rule to require ten lines for each review. When a movie is worthless, it doesn't take ten lines of text to let other readers know it's a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
