This film was so poorly written, directed and acted that it begs faith. It should be restored with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the actor. You have Jennifer Beals on one side, who is polished, professional and completely trustworthy, and on the other hand Ri'chard, who is violently mistaken and just throws in this piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave who owns (and holds) couples, although both usually do fine work. The actors (and the instructor) should not have tried to make accents at all - they are inconsistent and incredible. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in English. Casting is ridiculous. Why are the children of an "African" merchant (so less socially desirable for the gens de couleur community) cast with very bleached actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel has pronounced African traits, including a distinctly colored blond "fro"? It's as if casting directors can't be disturbed to read the script they casting and choosing appropriate actors from a large pool of highly talented and physically diverse color actors. It's just so weird! This could be a good movie and should be restored, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled players. There are lots of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.
