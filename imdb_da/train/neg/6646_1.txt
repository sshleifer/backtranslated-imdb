It is so sad that Romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated people who enjoy this kind of cheap and demonstrative show, as superficial and brutal as the "Garcea" series or the "Vacanta Mare" children's games ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such negotiators never presume to claim their performances as "art". Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a really good movie ("Duminicä la ora sase") followed by someone else who is enough ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare his film lengths "works of art" - but unfortunately he is gentlemen On a way for a limited level, it is specifically cinematographic expressions. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample of "HOW NOT" - it is about its only merit.
