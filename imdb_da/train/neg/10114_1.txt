This is one of the worst movies ever. I like cheesy movies, but it's simply awful. Where are the pictures in the movie that are on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD box's illustrations than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a company release a DVD so the cover is so misleading? I want such an idiot to rent this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I examine IMDb, I should have made a small study and made a list before I visited my local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, keep cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It will be much more fun. You've been warned!
