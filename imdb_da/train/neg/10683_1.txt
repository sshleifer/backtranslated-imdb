Some guy gets smashed. Just in sight, this other guy shoots him. He has some bodyguards and they beat the killer, but a journalist gets interested. She goes to the hospital, where they took the guy who was smashed. She walks in and corners a bodyguard, but he doesn't want to talk. I can't figure out why. It's not like anyone else is interested. She's the only reporter there. Yet her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But hey, she does anyway. She goes to see the killer sister and mother. A few minutes after she leaves, they are hit big time - someone is blowing their trailer - big ball of fire. Then she seeks bodyguard from the hospital. She finds him hammock on his boat, but a moment later they are both underwater sucking on a diving tank, because three guys are trying to lug them (and have blown the boat big time - big ball of fire). The reporter and bodyguard beat two of the boys trying to smash them. <br /> <br /> During the next hour, another guy will be whacked across the street, a shootout with multiple struts in a warehouse, a car chases with wreck and death, a fake suicide, etc. Lotsa stiffs, all kindsa carnage. Big things, but what the reporter and bodyguard can't figure out is: why in the hell was the original guy smashed. What is the motivation? It can of course help us find out why the reporter himself is interested. Through all this, she is the only journalist on history. No one else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies. True, the original guy who was smashed was not exactly a celebrity. His job was a little boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service Agent. <br /> <br /> Is it a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no TV cameras, no other print journalists, no bloggers ... just another of these cops is blocking crimes ... <br /> <br /> So what is spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme thinks ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spore is that his wife did it! Yeah ... the first lady. She was on the order because the president was fooling around. And she gets away with it. She's really sharp, huh? But how the hell could anyone ever find out? Why would anyone interfere? After all, only one reporter is just interested. <br /> <br /> I give this movement a "1". It was so stupid I had to watch. And it was only stupid! It's the right spoiler! But even if I have told you, you must see it to believe it!
