You will see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. It's not that movie. This movie is not fun. It is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good comments here seem to be written by (badly disguised) fake third parties. The people who made this movie seem to try to synthesize false interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a well done mockumentary. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are insulting. <br /> <br /> The movie is so mediocre that I can't imagine anyone familiar with the subject of fun. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the ones being pocketed this way, you must hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo issues, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
