I rarely write reviews to IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is horrible. Just awful. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hate.) And I had high expectations for this site when I found it listed on many "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I am now convinced that the top 10 lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all, there is almost no action in the film. Most of the film is about talking about the plot, which is a fantastic experience because it is at best thin. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978, but it is routinely according to today's standards. A special warning for Netflix users: the DVD they are sending is horrible; the picture is terrible and not even 16: 9 improved.
