Very, very humdrum movie fare here with Stella Stevens taking directions from someone in disguise (it didn't take me long to guess who it was) in Old Nevada Town outside of Vegas for a money hoist in the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her girl on three, and they find that they have to act much faster than expected. Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70s, very average but credible appearances from most involved, and a plot line of potential, the Las Vegas Lady puts a big boring egg. It seems forever for the movie to throw into gear, and when it does it just sputter here and there and never really faster. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Sure, I didn't expect anything good, but at least I thought this could be one of the nice movie films from the 70's or something similar. Not even close. No one dies. There is a lamb war between creaking Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo, a year before his great performance as the prosecutor Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. The war party has all the excitement of seeing a waterfall. There is a blow and a head hit with a mute instrument. Besides that, nothing is in the form of action. And for the girls, don't expect much there either. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre but beautiful talents, came in a sauna and a bath.) What we see? Stella wears these beautiful open blouses that highlight her real talents, but I wish she would have been a little more open with her performance. That way I could write a thing that would recommend the movie. Unfortunately, it was not and I have little to say in favor of this movie. It's not a horrible movie in any way, it just doesn't matter. Yawn.
