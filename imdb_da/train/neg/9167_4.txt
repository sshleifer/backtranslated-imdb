"The Leap Years" is a film adapted to an e-novella by the Singapore author Catherine Lim, who became the first Singapore novel / novel to be sold over the Internet. The movie had a sudden post production plan: shot at the beginning of 2005, it was launched for release at the end of 2005, but only ultimately up 3 years later, on February 29, 2008, a leap year. <br /> <Before I say anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the Romanesque genre, so I can be a little biased towards this movie - I just saw it because it was a Singapore production and that it is available for borrowing at my neighborhood library. Here are my two cents on the movie. Let's just start by saying that other than Qi Yu-wu's KS and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here on note seems to be a Eurasian. The love interest is a Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and Wang's trio of friends are all at home, Eurasians. This movie remains the stereotype that falls in love and connects with the Euras, more "in" than the ordinary Chinese (or whatever Asian race you are?) I don't know, it certainly works like that. Also, everyone in the movie speaks in some mysterious "anglified" accent that does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's the kind of "semi-perfect English" that the authorities want us to talk to, but that doesn't exist anywhere, says MTV Channel. The effect is that the film's dialogue sounds forced and stolen, not helped by the lack of sand blue singaporeans in the casting. The writer seems to try to be too hard to lace up after smart replicas. After twenty minutes, the film "white" begins to pill and the film begins to serve its usual plate of clichÃ©s. <br /> <br /> I don't think I enjoyed the movie because the whole premise of maintaining a love affair over 16 long years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other cheats in the movie. I can't believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall into one of Wong's friends. And the scene where the groom says, "Go before I change my mind", has been used in television series from hundreds of Asian (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.) <br /> <br /> So 4 stars to this movie. The production value is fair and Wong Li-lin is trying its best, but she is not helped with the script. Joan Chen has a 15 minute piece in the movie as the older Wong and is perhaps the best actress in the party, but hey, her role is just cameo. <br /> <br /> If you come across "The Leap Years" in the rental or library, you might pop it in the DVD player for the sake of curiosity, but otherwise for people who don't just settle for the romance genre, You decide if you want to give it a miss.
