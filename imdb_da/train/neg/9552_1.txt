Just clean, good old stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not the good stupid like Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood movie, this is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. Giving this movie a golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. Calling this movie stupid is offensive even to stupid people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, we are better able to truly launch World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single brainell off .... <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you are suicide.
