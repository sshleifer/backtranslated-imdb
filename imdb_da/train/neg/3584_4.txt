It is curious that Rene Russo's eyes and mouth - not Buddy the Gorillas - are the focus of "Buddy", a Jim Henson Pictures production by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face hit the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times that the bad monkeys are upstaged. Unintentional fun true story adapted to Gertrude's "Trudy" Davies Lint's memoirs of a wealthy wife who turns their mansion into a pet and game menagerie. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it kills positively with serious sincerity. The movie never sparks with the kind of "family movie" magic it needs, and for too long, both the people and the animals seem to be clearly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes, two chimpanzees walk around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cummy's head with inches); But no eyebrows are raised because it is all in a day's fun. But when the grown-up gorilla Buddy gets crazy during thunderstorms, the police are called - and everyone is staring at Buddy through the window while he breaks up in the living room. The furniture should be the least of anyone's concerns in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But at least we know Russo was in good hands: when director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder how the lipstick budget was in this picture? ** from ****
