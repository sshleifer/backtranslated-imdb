Being a film student I would like to think that I've seen a wide selection of movies, some good and some bad ones, but I have to say that 'Summer rain' is by far the worse movie I've ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that it would be a great British classic like "Secrets and Lies" or "Lockstock", but oh no it was so bad that my cool friend and I ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous play and cheesy script (reminded me of a poor 'theater in education' school production). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the start. 'Michelle' the protagonist who lives with her two friends has that kind of face that you would never get tired of relaxing and Gary was so wet (he stuck in tears every 5 minutes) that at the end of The movie really didn't give up on any of them. All I could think of was 'I paid Â£ 3 for this pile'. I've never written a review before, but after watching this movie, it has encouraged me to warn people about this disastrous production. So avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
