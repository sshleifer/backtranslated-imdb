Now now. As much as John Carpenter's season 1 outing in the "Masters of Horror" was, this is the complete opposite. He certainly proved that he was still fate with "Cigarette Burns", but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I have seen from him. It is stupid, without being a grim atmosphere and excitement, and it exceeds the welcome, despite being less than an hour's drive. The scripture is nonsense, the signs are annoying and unpleasant, and the conclusion is beyond absurd. <br /> <br /> And for the suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them is me); did you see how Carpenter describes the movie? He is actually proud of it, and he speaks of it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notes an obvious turn up that made it the last cut, he just says he didn't feel the decisive thing to rectifying the error and he just let it be there. I fear that the old master has completely lost touch. I sincerely hope that I have proved to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a positive mention and mention that the creativity is awesome. Technically, this film is top, with efficient lighting systems and make-up effects.
