This movie was the most horrible movie watching the experience I've ever had to endure and what's worse is that I had to watch it and not have the opportunity to stop it because it was in school ! Certainly the story was decent ... but I found the play terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight without any doubt that I would have been able to bear to watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say "derling", I crush! I almost attacked a customer the other day because they said "it". It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours in my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if it offended anyone, I only express my opinion)
