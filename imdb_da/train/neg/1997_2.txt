This version is probably available at your local dollar store on DVD. The printout is not great and the sound is not, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or so minutes to save, you get your money's worth (which doesn't say a horrible mass). Anna Neagle is extremely awake as Nanette. No matter what her charm may have been back in the day, they are not evident in this movie. A large number of fine character actors appear in this movie (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is remarkably smaller than their talents. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how such performing artists make the most of the weak writing. The musical numbers (which are really only two) are quite awful. It was clear that the studio did not feel compelled to enter into the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can be available at $ 1.00. It's worth a lot just to say you've seen it.
