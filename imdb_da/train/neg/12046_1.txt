I had great hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The movie was fixed so badly, it made my stomach ache. The pacing was so slow, the dialogue ridiculous and the film - well apart from a good battle scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was low. <br /> <br /> And why, why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris outside Troyens walls with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story like this has become a soap. <br /> <br /> Don't even start me on the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman, the war was fought over, and it didn't even look like the two were very concerned about the other. No sparks, no emotions, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say in the movie defense Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole acted very well with a bad script, but that's not enough to save this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where Â£ 200m budget went? Perhaps in all the trees they used for the funerals - where did they get all those trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed that it hurts.
