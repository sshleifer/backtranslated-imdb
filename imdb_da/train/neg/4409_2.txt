Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by genre-mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, then it's something weird?). Army Colonel Brian Keith spares with smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped the Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fist fights, shoot-outs, stagecoach robberies and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking in a low monotonous whole Keith is going to fall with a prostitute (some of a shock after his run on television's "family affair"), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes Keith's beloved talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who doesn't seem to notice or care. Hack direction, bad writing and more unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****
