I just came back from the movie and I was completely shaken. This film is an absolute mockery of all humanity. The theater I was in might have had 4 other people. This movie was recommended to me and I couldn't believe this person liked it. I can't believe that any sane man will like it. There was no plot NO PLOT AT ALL. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing. This movie only shows why Hollywood is in such a shambles. I can only look at the spiral in the "Horror Movie" industry and giggle. What is a travesty for all filmmakers, it applies to all the new "teen horror flicks" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all such garbage can. Do not support this kind of mushroom!
