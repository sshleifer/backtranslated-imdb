How this movie was made with so many great stars is beyond me. This is a horrible clich√© 'ridden movie with the worst act that any of these actors have ever done. It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would accept this unfunny movie. What's even worse is that nearly 100 million are made here in the states. However, it shows that big stars can pull on the goose even though the movie is horrible. I was sorry everyone involved in this snorkel party. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he got, and the rest of the stars seemed to go through the movements. No matter what you do, the excellent throw does not fall because no one could have saved this.
