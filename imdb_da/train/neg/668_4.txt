Then Prom Night would be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to watch this movie at first, but after seeing it, it's neither horror nor thriller. <br /> <br /> I basically made fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what would happen next time. The young actors were okay to play their characters, but I have to say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting. <br /> <br /> Yes, I want to make props for the plot because it was good, but it's not exciting or scary. There were almost zero "hop-in-your-seat" scenes. So don't play ten dollars to watch it in theaters, wait until it comes to DVD.
