After seeing the credits with only one name that I recognize and it was the preacher of this movie (Russ Conway), I didn't expect much from this movie and I was not disappointed. A man is planning to kill his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life. Unknown to the man is that the plastic-looking skull he uses, on the other hand, is a ghost in a woman, his first dead wife apparently has revenge on her heart and uses a genuine skull. A simple plot with an ironic twist at the end. If you are tired late one night and need sleep, it will help you sleep that sleep.
