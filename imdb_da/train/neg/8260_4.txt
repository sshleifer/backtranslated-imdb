First of all, I would like to point out that while I am not an expert, the way the trial was being treated will offend your intelligence. First, the prosecution never showed that facilitated learning actually works. Irresponsible to both the prosecution (because they can complain) and the defense not to act on this. As another commentary said, eased learning was untrue. Second, they used Terry as the translator, who has personal interest, and will even testify in the trial, which is just stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify that way, they would have brought in some neutral, otherwise they would just request an appeal. Thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant's prosecution (birthmarks, event details, etc.) And even when asked by defense-specific issues that when it started, he could not answer. If there is no reasonable doubt, I do not know what is and a competent lawyer would have been dismissed. <br /> <br /> The bottom line starts well with the pressure of being a parent of a child with autism, but the test makes this movie incredible.
