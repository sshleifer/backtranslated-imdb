I never finished this movie for a reason, it was terrible and it's just the actor. I wasn't even sure what the movie was about tbh it didn't make much sense and the violence was horrible. I mean miserably, I like some nude in a movie (lol), but it was just sick because of what happened. ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera shook parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with the project but without good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time and would like to have my time back, thank you. I would not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
