Demi Moore's character in the movie was chosen for the SEALs because of her appearance. It was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The reason was absolutely incredible. The will to do so in a hard military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting.
