I couldn't believe how lame and meaningless it was. Basically, there is nothing to laugh at the movie, almost no scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie. This movie drew in some great stars, but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must have taken some acting lessons a few years after this movie, before staring at The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and humble. Fortunately, I got this movie at a very low price because it certainly is not a movie to remember for good reasons. I don't want to write about the story of the movie, but as you should know she's supposed to be the most famous hitchhiker in America because of her huge thumb. I wanted to give this movie a 2/10. Before I saw this movie, I wondered why this movie only has a 4.0 / 10 and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Don't buy it yourself if you see it for under $ 5.
