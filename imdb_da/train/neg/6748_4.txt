Let me just say that I watched this video by watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the biggest horror flick ever, even though I thought it was just pretty good. Bleeding is rather poor. The best part is to see the female cast nude. Gore is very fake look and over-done. It has its fun parts, but it is very predictable and I didn't want to stay to watch the horrible ending. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses. The only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos, and I have also seen two other members of recorded in even or worse movie footage. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
