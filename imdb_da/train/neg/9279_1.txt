As with many other pop-culture franchise series, this line just didn't know when to finish. Instead of leaving things when they were completely finished, they continued to generate this; The first installment of this franchise falls very short of the mark. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have happened. There was no intention of a fourth film in this line, and it certainly shows. The premise is idiotic, and the portrayals were the same. After the wonderful experience, which was The Omen, it was a big disappointment that stank of 70's cheese and horrible plays. It resembles Amityville Horror in these aspects, leaving a horrible lingering stench long after it was over. <br /> <br /> It ranks a 1.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
