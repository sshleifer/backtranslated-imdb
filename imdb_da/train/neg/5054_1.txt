We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idea re√ßue few would challenge. Friends and relatives of these and others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center could well be moved by this fast-paced movie game. A sweet, serious, though tuna-bound firefighter is reminiscent of what he can by lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who transforms his fragments into a shelf. They are considering the results. He mumbles a little more, she composes another confidentiality etc. Etc. The dreadful events that trigger the need for thousands of eulogies are overwhelmingly sad, but this plodding insipid dramatization is disturbingly dull.
