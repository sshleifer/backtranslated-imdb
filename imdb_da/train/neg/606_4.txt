The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, it'll be interesting' several times. Once again, the interesting plot lines cease to be inexplicable or ignored, as they never did. The protagonist was annoying throughout the movie, and at one point my trap and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some really spooky / scary moments, but these are roughly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed hell out of me. It's another of those horror movies that breed and intrigue you for a while, but ultimately leave you frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when baddie is more sympathetic than the main character you know, you're on a loser.
