1914 was a great year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in film and he appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films were not very good, they gave him a chance to slowly develop his screenplay. However, the known "Little Tramp" character was still evolving under this film. Safe Charlie saw that, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other unpleasant things to humans for apparently no reason at all. <br /> <br /> For this very small movie, it is interesting to look for the cast. While not known today, Chaplin, along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, are all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that although it has a few fine scenes, the plot looks very vague and incorrect. Chester and Mabel came to the racetrack (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it must have been located near a racetrack). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack is being chased by the police to do this while Charlie beats Chester and steals his girl. Eventually, without apparent reason, the police take Chester and Mack away - leaving Charlie with Mabel (who strangely did not seem to be discouraged by Charlie's boorish behaviors). <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big silent comedy movie or film historian, this is a very forgotten movie that is only important in the development of Chaplin. What he and the other actors actually do on stage, but not uncommon for a Keystone movie, is not very fun when seen today.
