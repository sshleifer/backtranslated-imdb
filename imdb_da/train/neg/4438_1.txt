I borrowed this movie from the library, think it could be nice. How wrong am I! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to see the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but in this movie she is not seductive at all, but I have to witness her awkward attempts to seduce almost all the other great characters. It's so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the film's dialogue is so pretentious and lacks the humorous fact that makes it so acceptable. <br /> <br /> Complete failure.
