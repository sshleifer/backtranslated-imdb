There is no reason to understand why this film was ever made. Why should Hollywood continue to change a horrible update of a classic after another? (Cases in point: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - horrible!) Christopher Lloyd, whom I usually enjoy, was so miserably miscast in this role. His manic depiction of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so unthinkable unpleasant to be almost criminal. His ranting, moaning, grimacing and histrionics give us no reason to take care of his character except as a one-dimensional cartoon character. The director must have thought that fast-moving, screaming dialogue and "one-take" slapstick had no resemblance to comedy. Apparently, he told every actor to seem like they had red ants in their pants. <br /> <br /> Errors must lie with the irresponsibly executed script. I think the author used "It's a Food, Food, Food, Mad World" as an example of a fine comedy script. As a manic as the 1963 classic, it is far better than this claptrap - in fact - it suddenly looks pretty good in comparison. What is most sad about this movie is that it seems to have been written to appeal to young children. I'm just not sure where the kids it was made for. Absolutely not a self-respecting, card-bearing child, I know! <br /> <br /> If they were to restore "My Favorite Martian," why didn't they add some of the original classic's timeless charm? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot factor in "zero" as a rating for its readers, this is the only assessment that will come to mind in the description of this travesty. <br /> <br /> A good thing came from this movie, the actors and crew were paid - I think.
