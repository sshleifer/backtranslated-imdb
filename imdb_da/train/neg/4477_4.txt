What an empty and lacking gloss of the classic novel. I wish people would stop talking to classics when they clearly have no idea of ​​the real purpose or point of the original. This version is no different. I felt that Ralph Fienne's version is much worse, though the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy will have to be the worst casting decision, EVER ... yet back to this version. It aims to make history relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. It succeeds in both but high art it is nit. Throwaway view for a rainy day maybe ... The direction was average and editing abysmal. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great trip as Hindley and is actually one of Britains wasted talents. That part of Heath was played with great charm and faith, and I think the casting is the strongest point in this project. Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. It is clear that he was the director of rental and did not initiate the project with the passion it deserved.
