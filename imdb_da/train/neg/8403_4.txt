I gave this one four out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it appeared out of the blue at Showtime in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Spade Cooley has a few numbers. I think it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not quite sure the reason was so minimal that there is nothing really sticking to my memory. I remember vaguely that it is a Western musical comedy. Even Stooge seems to go through the movements. All in all, nothing very good to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan, then you won't bother. If you are a Stooge fan, stick with shorts.
