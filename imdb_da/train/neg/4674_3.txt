I don't know who should be due, Miss Leigh or her instructor, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to see. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, does an overall job - against all odds as far as I'm concerned. His character is far too charming and appealing. But certainly not shown as greedy enough to address Leigh's character's pity. Chaplin looks confused as to what cannot be understood as Leigh's shadow and lack of grace, but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness. There must be some element of credibility to his interest, but as the game it is incomprehensible. The performances do not matter. Of course, Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are wonderful despite every effort to track them. The support molding is also a pleasure to see. It is also a shame that the managers are not working together because the production is nice to look at.
