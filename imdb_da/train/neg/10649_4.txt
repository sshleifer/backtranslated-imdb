Johnny Weissmuller's latest film, 'Jung of the Jungle', after 16 years in the role of TARZAN AND MERMAIDS, is bound to disappoint everyone, but the most fiery of his fans. The 44-year-old was the former Olympic, one of Hollywood's most active "party animals", far past his youth's slim athleticism and so tired (though he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry, TARZAN and HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Not only had Weissmuller been too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the rare "Boy", had grown into a crew (he was a 17-year-old strapping), so he was printed out of the manuscript on the pretext of being "away in school". Brenda Joyce, at 35, appeared in her fourth of five films as 'Jane' (she would give the transition as Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, in 1949's TARZAN's MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as sweet as ever. <Br /> <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, at RKO, on a small budget, the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a certain Spanish air to the presumably darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey used the land of extensive, incorporating rock diving and an Aztec temple in history. <br /> <br /> When a young island girl (Tyrone Force's future bride, Linda Christian) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan, he learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of the film's most persistent villains) almost had slavery to the locals and threatened retaliation from a living 'God' if they did not do his commandments. The girl had been selected to become 'the Bride of God' so she fled. Faster than you can say 'Is this a stupid plot or WHAT?' Will the girl be kidnapped by the clergyman's henchmen and returned to the island, and Tarzan, followed by Jane, the colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (charming play by John Laurenz, who sings several tunes), and a government commissioner is unable to take on deity and his priest (poor cheetah is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the 'God' is simply a condom in an Aztec mask working with the pastor in milking the island's rich pearl beds), a bit of fights and comic relief and songs by Benjy when all expected happy conclusion. </p> <p> Please note that TARZAN AND MERMAIDS have a musical score of the brilliant film composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, and are far superior to what you would expect from this 'B' movie! <br /> <br /> While the film would give a less than beneficial end to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loophole (he would immediately continue to play Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variation of Monkey Man in Khakis), the talent involved lifted it overall product at least a little over the overall mess it could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was about to smile and become very sexier ...
