The Power Rangers, the horrible children's show of the 1990s, continue to disturb young children with the complete cheesiness and horrible settings. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing children how to fight each other to solve their differences. The toy was further demonstration of how to promote a violent television show and such. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show was ever. As such, it remains one of the worst children's shows ever made.
