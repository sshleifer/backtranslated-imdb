This is a classic stink with a big named cast, mostly seniors who were well past their primary and bedtime in this. <br /> <br /> This is pretty depressing movie when you think about it. Stay on the ground and you will be exposed to illness and eventually your death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed she could still dance. Too bad the film focused no more on it. Looking forward, Maureen Stapleton still shows these steps from the "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom", so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier. I just hope this movie does not encourage adults to commit a lot of suicide at the level of Jim Jones. How can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it makes you think? Why did Don Ameche have an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the seniors did such a wonderful thing at the end, why was the youth encouraged to get out of the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg also skip the ship? After all, he had found his lady-love. <br /> <br /> It would have been a great movie if seniors had just found their youth source on the ground and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately with the exception of Wilford Brimley, by this writing by Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and gentleman who are otherwise gone. The authors should have taken the script and placed it with this group as well.
