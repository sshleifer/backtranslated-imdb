Man captures the Alberts Rocky Mountains in a fantastic way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan provide entertaining performances that they always seem to do. <br /> <br /> But come on Hollywood - a Mountie that tells the people of Dawson City, Yukon to choose a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law itself, so warriors fight it out on the street control of the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing even remotely resembles what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold. Mr. Man and firm seem to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North of the American West. Canadian viewers are prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable cave with this ridiculous plot or shaking your head in disgust.
