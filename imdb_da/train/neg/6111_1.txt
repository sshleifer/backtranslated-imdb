Numerous Playboy spread and bad movies like this one (especially) directed by John destroyed what speed she had and made her many of a joke. The 1980s assumed that you could put a certain personality into a particular movie, and that would be a gold box, John expected to put Bo in a movie where she was naked for much of the maturity, would make people flock for theaters after 10 hype, maybe if the movie was good enough, this version of Tarzan has to be the very best of the many iterfortations of Burrough's lord in the jungle, a blow to the character's book and film heritage. , then the movie p Reasonable is a means of Bo's breasts and Richard Harris' wonderful over-acting (remember, the couple had worked together in Orca).

Bo's body can only get you so far. Miles O'Keeffe, who played at least Tarzan, would embark on a long and enjoyable B-movie career, and Richard Harris could postpone this after his latest acting triumphs, but Bo and John Derek never came back from this failure and Future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place. <br /> <br /> And how did the orangutan come to Africa?
