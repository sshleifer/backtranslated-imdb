I can't imagine anyone ever going to see this movie for a million years. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the mainstream. I tried to figure out where I saw an actor before and it fired. So, yes, a child stops playing little league because he doesn't like nukes, this is asking for great media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war. The end. A fantasy, to be sure, but one so cuddly it would make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as the -ism that scares hell out of us, this film really has no relevance unless one (unapproachable) looks back at those times. Writing, acting and movie vessels are also undeveloped. The reason I rated it as high as I did was because I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still have a small place in my heart for it, but I realize now that it is not completely cut mustard. So if the law of big numbers is true and someone finally decides to check this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also much worse. (I will refrain from a John Q. tirade for now.)
