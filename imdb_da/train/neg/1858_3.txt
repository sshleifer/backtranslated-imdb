A serial killer dies in a blizzard and is mutated to Frosty Snowman's evil twin. Then a killing continues Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it's scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's a kind of cheesy. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie that can become a cult movie. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not in it. Although I didn't like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I found entertaining. Such as bathtub scene and post-explosion scene with Picasso reference. It was also fun to watch the many heroes trying to kill Jack and he just doesn't seem to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B movie comedy, but a poor low-budget B movie horror.
