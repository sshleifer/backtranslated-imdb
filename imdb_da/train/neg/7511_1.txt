This was one of the most ridiculous and ill-fated movies I've seen for a very long time. I never wanted Spike Lee, but thought I'd give this a try: bad mistake. The film will show how Son of Sam's real life killings hit a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; What it really did was to center around the most boring characters I doubt, someone cared for in terms of their drug problems, marriage problems, etc. The scenarios depicting the murders are just that and nothing more; a shooting and then it's back to Saturday Night Fever! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to appear as a reporter in the movie: Spike, trust me, you're no Hitchcock, get out of the movies, it makes them even worse. The most stupid scene had to be the dog who spoke in a blunt voice, which was depicted in a scene before the one where it should have been shot ??? Spike, what did you think when you made this movie? Not thinking at all is my guess. People who think they want to see a crime movie take my advice and don't waste your time or money on this loser. You better see Jerry Springer in this case! Waste film, I gave it a 1 out of 10: horrible dud.
