Check out the movie's website, more time was set to do than writing the script for this movie. It couldn't be any more in that boast. Original story? Original? They must have found the manuscript hidden away between the Old Testament or have legal consequences for the little bit of horn-tooting. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jar of earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, America's funniest home video look is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money available for this title, so of course sf is not really as good or a little bad now and then or just plain, but it's the story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of set-befores and done-already's.
