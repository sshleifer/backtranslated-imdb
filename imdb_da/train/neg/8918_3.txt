... fortunately he doesn't have it! This is inappropriate, simplified student policy for drama. It needs the viewer to buy into a series of incidents. Conceit 1: That a British voter could be swung from being basically right in the center to being overwhelmingly far to the left. Conceit 2: That all debates in the media and the public are unanimously concluded and that the new prime minister's only critics are outrageous officials, MI5, big business and the Americans (of course). Conceit 3: That this radical socialist PM can solve all trade union, economic and social problems in a way that unites the nation. Conceit 4: Separating all ties to the United States and NATO is a good thing. Conceit 5: That the Soviet Union is not a brutal and repressive regime, and that we should have had times with them back in the 80s. And finally, Conceit 6: That US reactionary forces would actively try to launch a coup d'Ã©tat against Britain. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, and the show only got the reputation it did by trying to make money on some anti-Thatcher feelings in the country and having left-wing TV critics singing their praise. When it was made, television was still a hugely popular and influential medium of shows that received great ratings, so a wide-ranging talk of drama with a touch of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience. Ray McInally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points. History and time have shown the great weakness of the premise and the plot of this show.
