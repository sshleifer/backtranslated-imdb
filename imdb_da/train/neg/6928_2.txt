All the other comments already said what to say, here goes anyway. I thought it was Italian first, excuse it, Italy. I didn't get bored because I was waiting for something to happen. Who made that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather back then? Was it Alan Parsons? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 package, and the quality was as expected, horrible. Full of strokes and things. The film was an incoherent mess. Goofy music and clueless characters. The main guy should have known in the first moment that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. I thought the "doctor" who directed the "fight" scene never came to an end. Had some great babes though. It seems that these stupid ass movies always throw in a naked chicken or two and it makes you hang. I gave it a 2 to nekkid women. The bird that people danced made me pull out my own eye arches. Poe probably made about 3,000 rpm in his grave as this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story about his.
