Let me first start with a quote, a friend of mine said while looking at this movie: "This whole movie should have been a trip. You know, like" DUDE, I BET YOU CANNOT DO THE MEETING MOVIE EVER "". With this film, they have made a good effort to reach the title. The effects are of course poor. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors assume to be in college. But parts of it (especially in the beginning) make it seem like they should be in high school or middle school. It makes no sense. The bird scare goes around and kills people is not least fun. (SPOILER: At the end, when they chant Lester's name and he returns, the black guy and Scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief, they were on their last scene and in the cheesy dialogue.)
