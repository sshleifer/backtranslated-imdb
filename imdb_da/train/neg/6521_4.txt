I probably won't give this movie a fair shake as I couldn't see it all. Perhaps if I had seen it in a theater in its original presentation, I could have appreciated it, but it is far too slow for me. I read the book 25 years ago and details of the plot are faded from memory. This did not help the movie, as it is somewhat less than vibrant and clear in its presentation of events. <br /> <br /> This is really four interconnected movies or a movie in four parts, and I think it was supposed to be over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found part I enough to be comfortable, but that was all I could do to sit through Part II, which draws immeasurably. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or read it in the original, his brilliant writing outweighs the problems one might have with the pace of history. On film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I have other issues with the parts of the movie I saw. It is very splashy, with a lot of hi-ma-look-to-this camera work that calls attention to itself, rather than earning to promote history. Obviously I am missing something, but I just couldn't call the enthusiasm to turn up in Parts III and IV.
