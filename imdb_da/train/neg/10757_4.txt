I just watched this movie on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that "I, robot" has polarized the critical display community here at IMDb (and has given rise to many insults and name calls as well). I find this somewhat surprising, as this movie is not big (or even good), but it is not terrible either (or even really bad). What this movie really is ... is depressing. To suppress that the American film-goer population is so ready to run into the gorge, clich√© reheat and recognize them as spectacular new works. This movie as "retread" written all over, from the plot line (an unpleasant mix of Asimov and today's uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with titanium hoop) to the special effects (it borrowed from Matrix and a few others). Unfortunately, "I, the Robot" is the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, spooky sneaky dialogue and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew it (he seems to be Hollywood's recent failed attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people who are attracted to this movie are critically minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster according to today's standards, but a lot of B-movies compared to true winners.
