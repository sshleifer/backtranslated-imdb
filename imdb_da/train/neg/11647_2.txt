CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime film was partially recorded in Hamburg, Germany. An easily forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good car chase sequence, this flick seems to be emptying on almost aimlessly. A new Don takes over a strong Mafia family and finds himself in battle for his own life. Unwritten laws and ethics in the Mafia Code make it hard to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence breed the same in return. This cannot be put on a shelf with the right gangster epics. Just the look of the movie brings back memories of American drive-in ticket. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas cannot increase the caliber of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also stars with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
