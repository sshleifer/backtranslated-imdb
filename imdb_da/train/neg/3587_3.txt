How can they from Joe Don Baker (like Bufford Pusser in the first successor) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second successor). Why did they do it. Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser, they still should I change it because the first successor it was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and one of what I wanted to see in the second sequel. I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10, and I would have given it a 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life, but it did and that's why I had given this movie a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone planning to see this cheese, I suggest, and not see the first successor instead.
