Hi HULU.com plays Elvira song show on their website, and this movie is their name Monsteroid, it's fun to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie .... Have fun with bad movies. Anyways this movie really has very little value other than seeing how bad the 70s were for horror flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movie making. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. While at HELU, you can see the other movies that are theirs right now, there are 10 episodes, and some are pretty decent movies with good plot and production, and you can see many of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.
