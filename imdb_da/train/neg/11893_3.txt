** Can contain Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A guy in a dunky Kong suit (the same one used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) gives many of the laffs in it very mocked monster flick. Kong is revived on Mondo Island and helps the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time. The vampire-like villain is called Dr. Who? - funny, he doesn't look like Peter Cushing! King finally celebrates it with Who is pride and joy, a huge robot monkey that looks like a bad metal sculpture by Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's flicks, this may have had some profit before the American audience diddled around with it and added new footage. The Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess. They should have attached to superior children's programs such as The Little Drummer Boy.
