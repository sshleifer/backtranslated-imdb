Unless you are between 10 and 14 years old (except R rating), there are very few things to do here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should really see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous, and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can consider her surroundings, but unfortunately it is. Bad plot. Bad behavior. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are gloomy. As much as the whole situation is a strange and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are just as terrible. If we consider the action parts then there are incredible action sequences in some movies that make you dizzy and there are some that make you moan. This movie contains only the latter. This leaves a little left. I'm so glad I didn't pay for this. <br /> <br /> Despite any hype I can read and think so I sat down to see that I didn't expect anything good. I had no expectations but was a bit worried about going in. But as a train wreck you can't just look away. And even without expectations I was let down. Bath. Not even 'so bad, it's good' material. I'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but it makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI'd waste is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all I can think of as an answer. <br /> <br /> I could go on but say enough that tonight I saw a train wreck. I have to go and wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
