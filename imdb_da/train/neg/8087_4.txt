The film lacks credibility with the helicopters, which did not exist before the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement in the 60s and 70s. About the only part of the movie that you could believe was that Germany would know where the landing would be. Ignore the moment the British had taken all the spies, but even if they did not, they would not have let a rip around like this to assure the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. It's not a big thing that doesn't make the movie work. It is the culmination of all the things that are wrong that cause the film to fail. Poor routing, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (whatsoever) all to just make the movie fall flat. Generally, spies must fall into the woodwork. The excitement comes into the spy, wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being discovered. At this it was the game from the start. This spy did anything but spy. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and inspires some excitement may be to read the book.
