This movie, for a post-school special, is not that bad and that is the problem. Nothing happens. You feel as if you are still in the class. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paintball players. We must never see these underdogs bad, as the good player trains them. They suddenly become good players by meditating. There are also too many signs and no sign development. Too much time spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other children. This could have had a 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original), as there was a girl on a whole boy's team, but there was no sense of this movie at all. It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after seeing it, it's not fun to pose on, not fun to watch, and is just kind of ... there. Generally. Boring. Something you would look for the school before your night at night. As boring as the day is long, and it has been a long, long day to watch this movie.
