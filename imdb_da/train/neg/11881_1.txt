This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except in the premise. The office space was fun. I would not recommend this movie to anyone as I did not laugh once during the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-indulgent tiras quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexander's in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or view it at someone else's house so you can go if necessary.
