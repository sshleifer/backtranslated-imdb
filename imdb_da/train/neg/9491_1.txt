This movie really appreciates the invention of the fast forward button on your remote. It is exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once, Hamilton goes relatively soft on soft shots. But what I found hard to take on the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot, girls were portrayed so much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing, especially since there is an older man involved, leaves me a little restless. The heroine is actually shaved in the pub area to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a great time - between consenting adults. Another thing I found strange was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the movie, yes, not a real one at least.
