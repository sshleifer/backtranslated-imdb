I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool and I would like to see a real kick-butt viking movie for a while now ... unfortunately this movie was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead a boring Nordic soap opera was delivered, which seemed to drag on for too long despite its 84-minute maturity. The premise of the film is exciting enough: It is about a Viking warlord who tolerates his God, and Odin is so furious that he curses the warlord's son, called Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live furious, insane and violent life after life. The film is adequately recorded, with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances from the actors, but again I felt bored and asked when this dribbling would end. The filmmakers had a chance to make something quite entertaining and semi-unique, but they lost the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in for example. Free naked and lots of gore ... I mean we're talking about "Berserkers" here, aren't we? Vikings should be bad enough, what about all rape and looting, then is it not Berserkers that should be even more extreme? All in all, unless you are a fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) or of course you are a crazy Berserker who likes self-confidence, I would probably reject this slaughtering piece of celluloid.
