(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to see this tonight. I had to turn it off for the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding rude, disrespectful, and ruthless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was "We should at least no longer look at her." Keaton did a good job of moving into her anesthetic state and into grieving, but it was too far away for me then. I simply didn't enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to look after the protagonist, make me worry about the characters much faster - if it's almost an hour in and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The support cast was sincere and well-played - I felt for them! * - And the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, it wasn't enough to carry the movie to me.
