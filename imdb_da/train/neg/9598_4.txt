Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known all over the world as a world-renowned television reporter. Less familiar but equally cumbersome are his exploits as a full-time filand. <br /> <br /> I saw `Vivre pour Vivre 'in English titled' Live for Life '. Some lives! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: a mistress going out, one going in and the cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib lover. Among his most useful lies is 'I call you tomorrow' and 'My work took longer than planned.' He spends a lot of time and money on flights, trains and hotel rooms for his order of connections. You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants. Some can find their life exciting, but I thought it was boring. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceptive you wonder if he enjoys all this. <br /> <br /> Adding to the tedium is a significant recording that no longer ranks. There are extended sections without dialogue or French-only dialogue. We see documentary films about wars, torture and troop education that are distinguished between living action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this movie. Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the start of her career. I can't fault Yves Montander's performance of what was basically an amoral bum. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's new techniques. In a hotel room, the camera scans the camera around the room that Robert and his mistress argue. We spot them briefly during each passage around the room. In another scene put on a sleeping car by a train, Robert lies on the top bunk while his wife is on the bottom. Robert gives his wife some important but disturbing news, but we only hear parts of it because of the train's climbing. I felt that his wife also couldn't absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of these scenes and of those in Amsterdam was amazing. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Congress Library. I have mentioned the project FIFTY: 50 remarkable movies forgotten within 50 years. As best I can decide, this movie, like the other forty nine I've identified, has not been on video, telecast or distributed in the United States since its original release. In my opinion, it is worth being made available again. <br /> <br />
