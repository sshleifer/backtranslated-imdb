This movie is really bad, with a script full of 'memorable' lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen), and the music is so bad you have to listen to it to believe it. Only two short themes (30 seconds long or so) are repeated throughout the film. All in all, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
