Was there a single positive for this movie? Critics who did not know anything about video games could find the game errors found. No damage done with damage that is clearly visible in the beginning is a prime example. <br /> <br /> And I might have missed something but wasn't Super Mario Bros. 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before? Well, if that's the case, and I didn't miss anything ... how did Fred Savage know the character, and even the girl, so much about the game already? We talk things that some people do not know by their second or third review. <br /> <br /> Besides the actual and gaming mistakes, there is the overall low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The child was not even so good at playing video games in the pictures they showed. Many children I knew far back these days were considerably more experienced. On top of all this, acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. The signs are bland and completely uninteresting. "The Wizard" (the youngest child) is a very quiet, completely dry childhood bitch by a young child who almost never speaks because of a trauma. It is not that this is unrealistic, it is the fact that it had to be thrown into the film to actually start forming a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes. Honestly, the only value that exists here is of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you would like it, whether it was good or not. It was about children playing video games, and at the time you saw it, you probably had an obsession with NES too. But unless you loved it as a child, it just isn't something that will keep you interested and very little that prevents you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No gentleman, I didn't like it.
