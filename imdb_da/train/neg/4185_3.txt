I give this movie a 3 because it's worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper 2. It doesn't make sense to you? Well, it doesn't. This is another vampire movie with a silly plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) hit a space race of moron vampires. <br /> <br /> Is it something ugly than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her amazing Norwegian beauty. God, I want Michael Ironside and the deLuise brothers would stop accepting stupid roles in silly movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he has acted in 164 movies on this date !! It is true that he rarely had a big role, but still!
