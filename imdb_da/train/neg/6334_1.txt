I watched this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when it was released. The theater was maybe 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes in the movie I and the friend who went with me to watch the movie were the only two people in the theater. The movie was really strange and had no plot or reason for its script and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie .... why endure such torture ?? ... here's why. We wanted to be true film critics ... having a standard to base all other movies on it's hard to justify seeing the best movie (a 10), they always come up with something better. But it's easy to base any other movie out of the worst movie ever made (and that's it ... a 1 at best). There may be other movies out there that really qualify as a 1, but I haven't seen them yet. I now base all the movies I see on a scale based on this worst .... I am a true film critic ... he he.
