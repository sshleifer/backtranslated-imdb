This is the only movie I've seen made by Uwe Boll, I knew he was probably the worst director ever to ever make video game films that "House of the Dead" is one of IMDb's bottom 100. But I still wanted to see it because I'm a big fan of the game and I wanted to see what has the movie that makes it so bad. After seeing it, I agree that it is bad, the film had no history. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls without brains running around (in a moment I wonder the zombies are brain-dead? Or the girls are?) So at night the zombies came out of nowhere & began to attack people later, a woman began to shoot them. I think it takes you somewhere and every other five minutes. Should it be a comedy, or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the other half and woke up at the end credits, so I couldn't see it all, which is a good thing! The movie is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more movies. Thank you!
