I love Don Knotts, let me just say it upfront! He is a tremendous talent and the best of what he does, which is an expression of a nervous, lovably befuddled loser thrown into an authority position. He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the restrained astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, really, though as a child I was happy to see this and his other films. It's still worth watching, but it's really a movie that best enjoys children. I would categorize it as 100% family friendly and something you could sit down with and watch with your kids on a family home evening. As with all Knotts movies, there is a huge cast of beloved character actors, and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky open mouthpieces no matter how old and jaded you are. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, one thing I think is amazing about this movie is how it captures NASA in the 1960s - all the new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then. Only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a pretty wearable, excruciating woman who can't give him time of day until he becomes a big shot - if you're like me, you will hope he gives her the push at the end. Beware - you will whistle the theme for days after seeing it, it is so captivating.
