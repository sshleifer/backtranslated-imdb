I can't believe that Muncies city is so hard for attention that they would be bothered by letting this show be done there. This show is like a blow to the face of real hardworking law enforcement agencies. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life before in my life. If they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing, but to say it, the reality is nothing less than a lie. I only saw it once and was shaken by what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy come into a foot-hunt with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the chief of police and all the officials must put their heads in shame and should never want to admit they come from the city. No wonder it didn't stay on TV
