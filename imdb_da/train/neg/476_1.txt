When converting a book into movies, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's planned tone or conveyed concepts, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it is clear that the director had access to and counseled by Elinore Stewart's children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar with regard to the good, enriching, empowering experience of performing his country. The book describes her life at her and her husband's adjoining home in the great Wyoming border; She chronicles daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, even though they lived dozens of miles apart. However, the film takes a standard stance on the time it was made, and portrayed this woman's experience as hard, unforgiving and almost meaningless. Perhaps the director leads some of his Vietnam war experiences with him to this movie (as some movie players have said), but it seems to be a miserable excuse to take all the joy and beauty into the book and turn it into a gloomy, odious landscape without friends or hope. Don't waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
