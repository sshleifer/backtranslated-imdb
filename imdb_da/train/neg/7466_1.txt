Wow. Some movies just give me speechless. This was undoubtedly one of those movies. When I left the theater, not one word came to my mouth. All I had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theater wall to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was at first class level, at best the play was too stupid, and the plot was astronomically removed. I'm never allowed to watch another movie with Chris Kattan or another cast member of SNL.
