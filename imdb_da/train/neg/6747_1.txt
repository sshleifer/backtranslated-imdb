Wow ... speechless about making this movie, I can't say much. The cover box on the local video store should have said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who get lost on the show and decide to shoot a movie! The actor was apparently not in the budget, but they could afford nudity and great actors! Style over fabric almost makes its mark here, unless most of these action classes fail, forgetting that there is a plot to go somewhere when reading this script. After only 4 or 5 kills of the so-called masked murderer and a confusing tie about a murder club, which the stupid lead actress thinks is a real club that she can attend (only if she can get over a girl who encounters her car) You will stick your hands with the closest sharp object to remind yourself to never be too excited by a possibly good movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought this movie and can't find anyone to take it off their hands. Another example of what is wrong with the increasing number directly to video horror releases without the thought essentially set. Throw it away if you bought this.
