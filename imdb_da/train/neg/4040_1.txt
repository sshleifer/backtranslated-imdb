I consider myself to be a little snob when it comes to everything, and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than loud drama, I can also be very stuck on film. art film is better than King Kong. I could probably give King two stars, double the moves of the movie. <br /> <br /> My guess is that people were so excited about this because it was almost identical to the style of what you can see in a game. For the less discerning art buffer, a movie similar to a game is 'great art'. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was useless. <br /> <br /> There was hardly any history so proud of high drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would fall off the roof or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting? Barely. To be too fair: Some of the landscapes were interesting, though: communist apartments, urban environments (Petersburg?) And Soviet trams still in use.
