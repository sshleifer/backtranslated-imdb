It's not the most suitable slasher movies from time to time, but for what it is, it's pretty entertaining. The ground is lame, but the killings are not so bad. I have to be honest, if you don't follow the ties that exist in this movie, you won't find this movie as fun as those who do. I knew someone who watched this movie and was really disappointed by the poor quality of the movie, but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time to be on tour between playing for moshing kids and drinkin 'with friends backstage. .. it's not made to be taken seriously It is unbearable at the best punk and with over 100 kills, most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to make friends see, drink and be happy!
