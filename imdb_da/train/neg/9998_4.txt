At the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom and saw how our marine is doing rescue at sea. I liked to see the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have figured it out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is strange and not realistic. The action was pretty good as they are most experienced professionals, but if you have to go so far from what would probably happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comic, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the film Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night spokeswoman and Dracula also had on board. The film was filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood must exaggerate a bit for drama, but it hurts the quality of a movie when a serious topic is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet with a movie about the flight is that everyone just moves randomly. They walk around with drinks, put them down and pick them up 5 minutes later as if they were in a building or something, and appear as if turbulence does not exist. I also know it's a disaster movie, but excitement doesn't have to contain a 30 second crash after hit something. Nevertheless, skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from being made into a movie that has can after the first screening. I like Lee Grant but it was fun watching a psychotic person get decked ... :)
