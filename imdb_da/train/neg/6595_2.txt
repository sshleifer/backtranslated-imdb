I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my kids in the morning, we left to come home because I had packed all their toys away. (Toddlers don't like to see "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old found a scene fun, but told me the rest of it was "too stupid". This is a four year old, people. Anyone at the age, says nine, would like to kill their television instead of letting it play itself. <br /> <br /> Saying this movie is bad is that the Holocaust was a little mistake. There is no word for how ridiculous and utterly horrible this "movie" really is. The action is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. As this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can't even laugh at the movie's badness makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with any weird false accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are awful. I haven't seen a real Laurel and Hardy movie in ages, but I know they should be far better than this. What is the purpose of destroying a classic comic duo with this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Derived waste. Avoid at all costs unless you have any freaky Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2.10
