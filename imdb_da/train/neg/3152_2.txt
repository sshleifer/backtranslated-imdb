Poorly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogue. Not a single scene is shining. The actors are struggling with a painfully boring scenario that manages to avoid complete surprises, plot twists or conflicts. You know from the first ten minutes where it goes. <br /> <br /> For a movie set in NY, it has almost no sense for the city. There are a dozen other indie films that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget. This one seems to be shot in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you throw Natasha Henstridge, why dress in baggy sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and boring? Where is the attraction? I felt I was watching a strange Christian movie this week, it was so unusual and moralizing. <br /> <br /> Steven Feders great success is that he convinced people to make this gentle movie.
