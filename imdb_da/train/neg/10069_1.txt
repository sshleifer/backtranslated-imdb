This is a horrible movie. Yes the girls are beautiful, but it's not very good. The reason with a cowboy involved with an Indian girl would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way. Well, okay it could be interesting, but it wasn't because it was so poorly paced and and only partially acted. I can only imagine how the nearby dance halls look on a big screen, probably more ridiculous, so they do on TV. (I don't even want to mention the topless knife fight between two women tied together and spending the whole chest chest to chest. Never read about it in the old west) This is a movie that requires liberal use of fast forward. /> <br /> I like schlock movies, but that's ridiculous. There is a reason why I don't go for this kind of movie, and they don't tend to be very good, the plot takes a back seat to breasts. The original nudie cuties as they were called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching, but as the adult industry began to grow the filmmakers, either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else to hit the seats. The wise were very few who left only hacks of limited talent. The comedies often came out best with the humor that approaches the first class level, the child but harmless fun. Something that can rarely be said of any other genre that is combed as a nudie. <br /> <br /> Ramrodder looks good and has a few fine pieces, but it is done by being neither Western nor sex movie. <Br /> <br /> I don't have to see it again. <br /> <br /> Of interest to anyone, the rapist and killer in the movie was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a schoolteacher not long after the film wrapped. Of course, these kinds of things will ruin some people's lives.
