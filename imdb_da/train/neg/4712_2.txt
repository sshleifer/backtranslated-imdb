This show may be the biggest, ugliest, most generic steam rod I've seen in children's programming that has actually been successful. The protagonist, Johnny, while I understand that he must represent an ordinary child, is not sympathetic or even tolerable. The whispers are lame, overdone (that is, "Whoa! So not the coming" gag. Come on, it wasn't even fun the first time. It's not even sweet) and lacks any primitive humor or inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to look at. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye care. I can't stand watching the show, because in a way the art style is just ... gross. Actually. Just plain crummy. <br /> <br /> I just can't argue that this gets so much odor. While I understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and I shouldn't get it hoped it will come back ... I really miss the old cartoons. Bring Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... anything but this crap. I think it's just desirable thinking though. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste your time on this show. I think the big kids can also enjoy really good cartoons. And it doesn't cut it.
