What an incomprehensible mess on a movie. Something about a policeman pulling bullets from himself after he was shot and holding them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he has been shot about fifty times now) and a secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who, for some reason, drive it to Mexico. Whether they were sent there on purpose or just got really really lost, it's never clear. And you will never hear another manuscript function the word "butthorn" either. Gary Busey tries the Mel Gibson role from "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is a serviceable actor, the play destroys the whole movie for mediocrity. William Smith makes another trip as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. Having played biker heavies for most of the 70s, it was kind of fun to see him expanding his reach to play communist weights. Unfortunately, he will probably always be remembered best as the guy that Clint Eastwood whupped in "Every way you can."
