This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last one. This time, the mirror is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some weird reasons. In my opinion, this movie was very meaningless and unnecessary and not even fun. Maybe I laughed three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but one was just stupid. If your jokes consist of corpses that are being opened up and people are constantly throwing things at each other, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay home and save money and stop making these kinds of movies, they just get worse 3/10.
