After reading some very good reviews about this movie, I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the movie I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first ever so naked with me. First of all, I would scratch the horror of the genre as it is by no means terrible or scary at least (with the exception of a few weak attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of them worked on me.) I want to say calling this movie a thriller pushing it which I was not particularly excited about! The film is about a pampered rude girl who enemies a couple of times. During these times she visits a house that she has drawn, after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a little more lively. One of the features is a sad little boy who is also sick in reality. As she turns to the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world she created is actually better than the real world she is in. Until she adds her constant father to the house, she turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from their links. <br /> <br /> Think of an attempt to be a slightly milder version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's more like a beach trip. <br /> <br /> Finally, my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from seeing this killing!
