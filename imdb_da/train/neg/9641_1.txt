If you look at this movie, you are either a Fred Olen Ray fan, you found it at $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought "what should I lose?" Or you spun around in the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It has everything that a horrible movie needs: a scramble dialogue and enchanting detours in the plot, skewed science involving mental and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors who do not only wood, but seems to be the border of befuddled, gracious nudity (not all that is what you would necessarily ask for), and of course, a 5 'monster played by what I suppose is Fred Olen Ray's child. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is something similar to the heart - as if Mickey & Judy decided to collect all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hi! my dad can fix it! yes! We can use red paint from my Johnny's father hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can shop in it!). <br /> <br /> Look for the blooper coil over the credits - you'll find out why the final piece of the movie was so crazy. <br /> <br /> Also, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth a visit, but it does not have the same cozy crazy veneer this does.
