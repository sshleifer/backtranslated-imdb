I am a sucker for a good romance, but this one does not qualify as either good or romantic. I had plotted nailed down before credits were passed. With such poor dialogue, plot and character development, I suggest investing your second half hour. I had to hurry out and rent Serendipity for the third time so I could get the bad taste out of my mouth.
