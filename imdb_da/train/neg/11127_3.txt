I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when making this movie, but of course it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel on which the movie is based. <br /> <br /> We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12, and looked straight at the movie. During periodic listing and checking of the clock, I considered the chances of being hit by lightning strikes. Of course, the sky was clear and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-page essay on it. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel discussed very real themes, the idea of ​​a killer and the psychology behind it. Silver's film became a killer of a victim, which is not what Wright wanted (see: "Where the Greater were born" 454). I'll make it short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness, in Raphael Lambert's words, effortlessly, skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I'll write the essay.
