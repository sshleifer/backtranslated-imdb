This movie is a joke. I mean a "ha ha" funny joke. Why? Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got from the sheer ridicule of invisible, creepy plot, and horrible acting. Wow! <br /> <br /> Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; Why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie's "caretakers" and what are their purposes? Since when do 6 people make up a "nation" of zombies? And is the black black eye mascara "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this movie made at all? Why? Why? Why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> In fact, on the demand channel, they issued this comment after the movie's synopsis: We apologize for this movie in advance. "LOL. At least, they had a decency to do so much!
