First, let's agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, hardly just decent, sometimes just miserable. But in this piece of @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater sank the film industry as a whole. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the plot first. A Vietnamese veterinarian named Jack Kelly, also known as Soldier, gets the word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. That's why he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Had some potential, but still rather thin to begin with. <br /> <br /> Now the actor. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that these were some of the WORST acts of art history !!!!! Lama is good though. The jackasses that play Clampets / Deliverance rejects should be stretched and shot at their so-called performances that offend actors everywhere, especially talented, never-ending breakers! Finally, the action. The fight against war is uneven at BEST, and the fist fight is regrettable. I've seen more real matches at the Renaissance Festival (and they were pretty fake)! Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS PART OF CACA AT ALL COSTS! If it was the only movie in existence, you would still avoid it! For the sake of your brain-cell count, DO NOT see this thing!
