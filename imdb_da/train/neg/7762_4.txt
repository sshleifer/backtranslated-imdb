Considering that John Doe apparently inspired Kyle XY's creator, I expected the pilot to be quite interesting. But I probably had too high expectations because I was very disappointed with it. First, they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of ​​showing his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public domain. So after that scene I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story much less exciting. I was also a little disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance because I found that he didn't make a credible John Doe. Another problem was the history of the police. It really felt like déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. It leads us to the worst problem in the pile, the episodic format. I could already see the fillers come together. <br /> <br /> So overall, I was very disappointed with it and didn't recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was, I understood better now why the show was canceled. Somehow, I have the impression that it lacked its goal, develops characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club. The production quality was also quite good and the casting correct. But I never know if it got better, probably not because I don't plan on seeing the next episode.
