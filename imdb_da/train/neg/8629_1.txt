Dear Richard, I know we all loved you at Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, don't you have anything else to do besides lame successors to Air Bud? I would have thought Tim could actually give you some role now or even become his personal assistant. I know it seems ironic, but the salary is much more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone wanted to see you around Tim and immediately think of "Tool Time". You would even get roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smile. I know there wasn't much of a script, but you could have added it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie doesn't matter for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, they are fake talking puppies cornier than watching the dogs play sports. The original was better. And you, Mr Richard Karn, know it more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
