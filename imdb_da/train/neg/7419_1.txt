This movie was horrible and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the US government has always been vicious. The communist sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom are as stupid as a box of stones, love to take the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and the imagery him as the leader of a great movement. The truth is that at that time he was regarded as a fringe character who exploited a legitimate concern over the Soviet Communists for political gain. Oh yeah, and the United States brought over all the evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we had no room program. He actually loved being American and became a great benefit to the country. And yet the irony is that the Hollywood people, an uneducated party living a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run everything and give us everything we want. And yet, the same government is always portraying as a perfect film in movies like this.
