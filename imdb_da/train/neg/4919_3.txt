I have rarely been so annoyed by a leading achievement as I was by Ali McGraw in this movie. God is embarrassing or what? She says everything in the same tone and is terrible, so terrible that Ryan O'Neal, on the other hand, is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a story. He is rich, she is wood, they must both sacrifice much for love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, she's his first name if you didn't notice the difference in the two of them they overcame in the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate that it should have been a bad year. John Marley is fine as Wooden's father, but a support designation? At least Ali doesn't win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but then again, if it was up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in many more movies. She is definitely a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I didn't even cry when she got sick, never emerged for myself to feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones look like he was about 15, and the score is good. But this one is so old, now it has a beard a kilometer long, and its sin is not so old, but it feels it.
