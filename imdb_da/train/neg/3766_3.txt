I went into watching this movie and knew it wasn't amazing. but what I experienced was terrible for words. I don't mean to be hard, it's just the movie was terrible. All in all, it was bad, I mean AWFUL special effects, the action wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good either, and the sasquatch itself was like .... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion, the best sasquatch movie is Harry and Henderson's. It's not violent or horror, but it has the best depiction of Sasquatch. at least its a suit and no half-ass-cgi rip-off. Just watch this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate someone in the movie. or go see the boondock saints, it's much better.
