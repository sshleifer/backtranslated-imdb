From the very open scene you will notice how hard they attempted to imitate the very clever and powerful "cruel intentions" and how flat it landed. You will also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont ... So in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you can get past that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... Then the film goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice that Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past , here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here is called Cherie ... How original it is for a prequel. Then it becomes a low budget 'Wild Things' type movie with lots and many oh-mine "twists". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good. He just didn't have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, is once again delivering. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way to save this garbage. As a whole, this "movie" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode. The score has been stolen from "Cruel Intentions" and "Jawbreaker" ... Yes, they used the score from JAWBREAKER ... Couldn't they leave one alone? You want to pass this one. If you want more cruel intentions, see Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaison.
