"Cement" is a bad movie about a poor policeman (Penn) with a bad attitude and a poor disposition that has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast-drying concrete. While we are waiting for the cement to dry and the film to find out what it is about, we regularly return in time without any rhyme or reason so we can see events leading up to the things of the cement. A boring junk girl in general, "Cement" suffers from a lack of a story, a clumsy performance, and the most ubiquitous of the film's failure; no need to care. For a while, killing the needy sofa potato at best. (D +)
