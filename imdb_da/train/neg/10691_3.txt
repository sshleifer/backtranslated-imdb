I argued with myself to rent this or not. I'm always afraid to rent something I've never heard of (remember not to be in theaters). Big cast ... that's what tipped the scales. For 30 minutes I almost stopped seeing it. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. It only gets worse after that. The authors of this film can do some research on future projects if they want to make their movie even better. Or they could just try to write something just a bit trustworthy. I give it a 3 .... a 1 for the writing (only because there are words) and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to accept making this movie despite having to read the script. Oh my God, this movie sucks.
