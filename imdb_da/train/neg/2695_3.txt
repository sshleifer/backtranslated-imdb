When I go into the video store to rent a flick, I usually rely on IMDb's view of a movie and until it had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or more on the site I didn't like. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really fails here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: fill a movie cast with thoroughly uneven characters with no real redeeming features at all. <Br /> <br /> I like movies with erroneous characters, but no matter how dark a person's personality is, we all have a bit of light too, we are all shades of gray with some darker or lighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with completely unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife who hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser as he much is. His indecision and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he is too wrong to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery, which falls apart and mother is killed. At that time, he is standing up to his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but does not get much to work with as he is portrayed as a person with a boot that is permanently stamped on their face, and he "is not particularly aware that it is there." <br /> <br /> Speaking of which his fellow's wife is just as bad. Almost every shot of the movie she is in is that she orally prepares him for rent and baby money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, it's just about all the signs do. Albert Finney plays their father Charles and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, using about 90% of this film with the same mouth Open half-grieved on his face, as if he is suffering from the world's worst exhaustion of constipation. For someone who has been an actor for as long as Mr. Finney, you think he would be more inclined to feel. Although he does not show much, his character is probably sad and angry. And when he forges Andy in the movie's conclusion, it is akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster, he helped create out of his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei doesn't have much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and have an affair with his brother for an inevitable reason. When Andy's world begins to spiral out of control, she jumps logically ship, but it really doesn't make it any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the movie, but probably the most common sense at least. <And finally, we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, the only reason I rated this movie a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-dependent, astounding financial manager who is "perfect crime "To rob his parent's insured jewelry business goes wrong is fascinating. His descent from calm master planner of a flawless scheme to unstable, falsified mistreatment is credible and tragic. Hoffman's character ceases to be the movie's chief chaplain, but it's hard to mess with him as the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother, and a self-absorbed poor father's father led to his son's possible psychosis and indirect accidental murder of his mother. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is really worth looking at PSH's great achievements, and it's family change nature. Just don't expect there to be any signs worthy of rejoicing because there's really nothing.
