Whoa. In the Twin Cities we have a station showing a "Big Bad Movie" Monday to Friday. The night's nugget was a movie with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really annoying woman who ends up being murdered when thugs break into her house. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to haunt her husband. She wants him to seek revenge over his dead, so she's back. And she won't let him rest until he does. She annoys him endlessly ... and the viewers too! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hi, I like bad movies, though (my fave film is Xanadu). I really shook my head all over the movie and wondered who thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is just so annoying. The reason is stupid; the play is bad; the story ... Well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - really really bad movie, check this one out. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
