I've seen my share of Woody Allen's movie, and while they're not always good, you can usually be sure you're entertained. Probably the last really good were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, those I've seen have become patchy but watchable. And when I was invited to watch the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, which I wasn't even aware of, had been released yet, I happily went along. I hadn't really heard much about it, so I hoped I'd be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I've seen. The premise is explained, the casting is terrible, the manuscript is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out, I suppose to fill in what would otherwise be a 15 minute short film. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the concept behind this movie - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and of course, the film continues to show us that by playing out both scenarios. The problem is that none of these "two movies" are any good things. Comedy is not fun, and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen made a good idea, but then ran out of steam or time to complete the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall level of action is also bad too - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and it's basically a Woody Allen impression. Former good actors like Chloe Sevigny come out as annoying, and the worst of the pile is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the actors, the script they work on is missing if not non-existent. Definitely a long way from Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
