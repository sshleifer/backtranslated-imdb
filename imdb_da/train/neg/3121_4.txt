This movie is the trash. It has horrible tastes, and is pedestrian and convincing in script, although it is allegedly based on real events - which do not add much to anything but make it more of a disappointment. Direction is not well done, as scenes and dialogue are out of place. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. Initially, Williams is not convincing as gay in a collapse, nor is the relationship interesting. What's worse, his character is forced by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot unit. You have an older Rory Culkin tasteful spouting "d_ck_smker" - in good fun - which is annoying enough and then laughed at the Williams character. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as guardian angel counselor to Williams and a cast explanation of the entire failure towards the end. Toni Collete's character is simply annoying and a re-hash of her 6. Sense performance with the inferior direction. Very Miss-able.
