WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay money to watch this horrible movie. It was like a story nut went on a cola binge! The previews made it look decent, but it was really bad. I would say the idea sounded decent, but come on. It was really really bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would also realize it was unrealistic. Come back the day you think they had all the things to work with. It wasn't like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a marvelous puzzle. It was absolutely ridiculous, and you will see a bad movie, and then you have to see it here. All and ALL HORRIBLE movies it can actually be on my top 10 WORST movies I've ever seen.
