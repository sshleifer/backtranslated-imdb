This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While there are good actors, the film does not live up to expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music that basically sums up the movie: compensating for a bad and confusing story by having well-known actors, high and dramatic music. It doesn't change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch. Earn a score of 1.
