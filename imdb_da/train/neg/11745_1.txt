That I did not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical innacuracies are not. I realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if others are commenting falsely because of it. Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation, which was staged and reorganized because of the discovery on board the ship to release 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of whom was Samir Kuntar, a terrible terrorist whose story you can find by searching for " klinghoffer samir kanar "on google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other acts of terrorism, although he never set foot on Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC, did he? <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film almost apologizes to the terrorist acts and reactions due to horrors they may have lived, always accentuates and exaggerates how much the Israelis have done to hurt them. However, they never portray the damage the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis. The film uses (quite horrid !!!) pictures from Sabra and Chatila horror, and nothing is said, emphasizes the general conviction that it was Israel who was responsible without mentioning that it was a Syrian-Lebanese army who did the massacre. <br /> <br /> The action was generally very poor, but I think that's what can be expected from opera singers? <br /> <br /> On another note, I'm shocked at how a person can apologize to terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage attempted to touch the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists and added that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how scary his wife was, spit on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope nobody in the world is as cruel as she is (blink flash)
