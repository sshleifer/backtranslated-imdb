Using footage pillaged from Planet of Dinosaurs this shot on video (except for the stolen footage) relates to a lot of people shot into the room landing on a dinosaur planet that is ... not waiting for it to be truly earth. Its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes. A little better than Chickboxer (another in the Bad Movie Police series) - having a nostalgic home environment experience coupled with good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible hit to get through. I'm back to consider the question, are we so motionless that we now plunder old movies, not just for plot, but also for inconsistent recordings? Clearly low budget producers are becoming so desperate, they will really give us something to take our money on
