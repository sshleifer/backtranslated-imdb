I would not recommend this unless you are keen on David Copperfield and will "complete the set". There are some good performances (eg, Uriah Heep) and well-informed moments (eg the slogan), but overall, it really fades in comparison to the BBC's 1999 version and earlier versions. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes in history that really do not serve any great purpose except for possibly stupid it (the stolen jewels are a case in point). The American cast was poorly selected: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is wrong as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is slightly better than Dick Van Dykes cockney. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Micawber; however, he pours it a little too much and becomes annoying. He also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply treacherous. Anthony Andrews is threatening as Mr Murdstone, but you almost expect him to make a black cape and tie David's mother to a railway line (though this may be a part of Dickens's fault). <br /> <br /> I got this free with a newspaper. It helped pass a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than the charm of the end of it
