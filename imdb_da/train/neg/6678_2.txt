This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The story is more or less the same but is modern. Govinda plays a sharp witted guy who replaces man on the trip. While Rani plays college's girlfriend who does her the same service. They seem to be trying to catch each other while the real man and wife are trying to get together in Bombay. On the trip, Govinda fails another girl to Sanjiv's wife and spies on her as she falls in love with the amazing Rani. <br /> <br /> Liver plays a dual role as father and son both lawyers specializing in divorce cases. They are pitted against each other for the warring couple. <br /> <br /> It's a bad attempt to copy the original classics, and the songs are pretty horrible. The comedy is slap-stick and will not make one laugh too much.
