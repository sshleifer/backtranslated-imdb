Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'm a CYBORG, BUT IT'S OK, chock full of entertaining little technical blooms with some brilliant ideas sprinkled between them. Attempts to walk in the footsteps of the like. By Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESS), Park begins on an imaginative, light-headed tale that is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be pampered for his ambition or his vision, it is really unexpected to see Al Park's efforts add so little. I am a CYBORG, but it's OK, surprisingly, to subtract from itself as it goes along with the end result is a fraction of the sum of its parts. The prerequisite is promising, gags are abundant and scary humor abounds, but it all fails to create a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and ornate and played with the gusto of the cast, but try as I might, I couldn't make myself look after anyone. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a mistake, which may indicate the Park overindulged itself a little, but still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography it was easily forgiven. None of the insured trusts that ordered JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is clear here. I'm a CYBORG, but that's OK, so I'm totally uninvited. I instinctively made myself relay from time to time (more regularly, when the film was advanced). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by this measure it deserves no more than a 3. For old time I will be generous: 4/10
