Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: Desert of the Desert (they want!) With Melinda / Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert farmer who draws a bank hoist along with girlfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in a South prison prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw (an exaggerated Robert Englund in a toupee). She and her beloved animal powders end up hiding at a petrol station cluster until they are transformed by a recently fallen meteor. The dogs turn into unpleasant dragon queen "bitches" and Candy develops a very long, talkative, killing fork, she can't control. Thugs seeking the stolen foliage and other various numbskulls add extra complications. <br /> <br /> First, Clarke is great and does what to do with this movie. You see her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and aprons, including an eyelid, skin-tight latex bodysuit ... and wondering how this actress is not a big star. It's too bad, the rest of this cult attempt doesn't live up to its promise. <br /> <br /> Blame instructor / scripts Sciamma, who believes that the incredible premises alone are enough to maintain laughs ... but the annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogues of his vulgar gags are not a substitute for a true sense of humor . Another nail in the coffin; The movie looks cheap, lots of colorful colors and sets are strangely dampened by muddy photography and the dusty desert areas. Fortunately for Sciamma, Clarke is in her movie because she alone keeps you watching.
