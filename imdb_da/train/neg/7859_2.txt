My God. This movie was horrible. I can't complain about it too much. I went to see it just to be exhausted. It was enough, kind. It's fun that the most obnoxious part of the movie was in the very first beginning, where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby. I also think it's fun that the most notable actor in the movie was the Spanish soldier who was a supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the movie made a terrible play. It was some of the worst actions I have ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected it to be much more cruel than the first. It wasn't. I expected it to be more cruel because it is a successor, and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected to be more cruel when gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it was actually not as cruel as the first to be yet another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The M mutants in the first were disturbing, but the filmmakers tried so hard in it to make them creepy that they were quite funny. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera phone, saying "I love you, mommy" FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to continue trying to make us feel itself be for her by showing it three times for no reason. This movie was a joke.
