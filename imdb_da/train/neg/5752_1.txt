I don't usually comment, but there are things to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> The act on Jeremy London's part was horrible! I didn't think he could be so bad. The reason could have been good, had it been really directed along with a good solid performance from the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of the movies you are reading about and thinks it has great potential to be entertaining, but be disappointed from the start. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I got a laugh. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you.
