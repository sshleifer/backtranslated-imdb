This movie has a etc. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hacke Stein. The beginning and end credits show along with most of the players and the "special effects" that this is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in another crazy scientist, horror / comedy or low cost movie. Not special for any naked scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing too excited about. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of one line summary.
