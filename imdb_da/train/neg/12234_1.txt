I think it was just meaningless to produce another part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it is ridiculous to make another part of a movie where one of the protagonists (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story was over after the first movie. I wonder why anyone was trying to find a way to do the story. It was pointless!
