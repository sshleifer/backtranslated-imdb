This movie is a good example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes. Apart from the names of the characters, the film has very little resemblance to the book. A book full of strong Latin characters, and they mostly represent non-Latinos. There is no sign development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And to delete a complete generation is unpredictable. Isabel Allende has written a strong book and the book is what to read!
