OK well, I found this movie in my dad's old pile of movies and it looked good from the front, but the movie actually sucked !! OK the first story with the swimmer was pretty good, but it took a while to get in, then it was with the boy completely retarded! It wasn't even scary! His dream sounds like a little child's bedtime story. Then, the news girls were also completely retarded. I'm sure some will call the news guide and ask him to go with you. But one ended cool, she stuck him, and she was in the hospital, and she saw him, and he said everything that shot at her. Next was the beautiful gay story of the guy who brought back the dead people. AS it's so stupid, I'm not even saying it any more. The last one was the best. It wasn't that scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool .. yes, the girl gets obsessed and she kills all her classmates or something. So when they are all finished telling their dreams to each other, they get lost on the bus (HELLA AHAHAHAH) and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
