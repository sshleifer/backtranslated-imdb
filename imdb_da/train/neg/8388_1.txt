Get this heart-warming tale of hope. Hope you will never have to endure all this terrible again. * cough * Razzie award * cough * <br /> I didn't like this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and inane. While I was watching, I felt like I was in a psychologist experiment to decide how low film standards could get before people complained. When I requested the money back at the end of the movie, I was informed about it because I looked at the whole thing 'I wasn't entitled to reimbursement'. I was told by the assistant manager that more people had complained and received refunds already. <br /> <br /> The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget girl steals a diamond and poses as a baby to avoid the police. Under this clear disposition, on the other hand, is a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious sketches. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people being hit by pans? Do you like speed jokes? Do you like to see the midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racing jokes? Do you think babies say 'go goo goo goo goo gaa goa'? Are you running? <br /> <br /> If you answered yes to any of the above, this movie is for you. Although it has been billed in some places like 'The Worst Movie of the Decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that is worse ... somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate pre-tension on that part of the reviewer and then the review would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I cannot recommend it to anyone in good conscience. Save your money for something fun. respect
