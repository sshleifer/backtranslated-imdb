I wish Spike Lee had chosen another title for his movie. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer David Berkowitz. It is not. It's a gritty, earthly portrait of NYC street life in the hot summer of '77, when Berkowitz terrorized the city. <br /> <br /> The movie follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood and their responses to Son of Sam threat. There is Vinny and his wife Dionna; there are Richie and Ruby and several other characters. The problem is that these characters do not like. They are routinely irritating and sometimes unbearable. Lee then infuses their high energy, chaotic life, full of anger, lust, and general unrest. There are at least two long-lasting battle scenes between Vinny and his wife, superfluous disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... About and I kept wondering: where's the movie editor? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with all that great, the movie passes the chance to convey a true sense of fear or fear as a result of Sammen's son, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing another type of threat from neighborhood groups. <br /> <br /> The action is uniformly good. Combined with 70's disco music and sumptuous attention to costumes and production design, it makes you feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in NYC in 1977. rambling, overblown script about life for grossly annoying people.
