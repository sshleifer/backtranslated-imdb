This fake journey never comes close to matching the game and the wildness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie. This pass is trying to move away from its prequel to catch some new blood out of the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and travels nowhere interesting or fun. <br /> <br /> There is almost half an hour wasting show guys making a rock concert (and many people watch "free TV" - since when does it happen?) Probably the scriptwriter could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were nicely tied together by converging them on the science presentation. Not in this movie that almost ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The wit was over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for whatever reason. This infusion, as the whole plot, is badly done and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement. There is a ZZ Top impression, hammered for no reason. There is light, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or fun. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
