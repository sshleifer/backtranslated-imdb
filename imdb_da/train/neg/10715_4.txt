What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere loses the movie. In fact, it never really went. There was some excitement when we found out that Angie is not really pregnant, so find out that she is, but it was. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was horrible, and his whole character wasn't even close to being important to this movie, except to do it anymore. I would really have wanted to see more interactions between the protagonists, Kate and Angie, and maybe not try for a pure comedy, which unfortunately was not, but perhaps a drama of comic elements. I think if the movie did, it could have been a lot of fun as both actresses are quite fun in their own ways and sit here, thinking of many scenarios that would have been a rebellion.
