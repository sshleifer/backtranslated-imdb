This movie is really wack. There really is no good I can say about it, besides the moral truth expressed in the climax of the film about people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime. Besides all that, the film had nothing: no good shots, not good plays and not a good script. I give this movie a F and a 2 out of 10.
