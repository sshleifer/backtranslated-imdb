This was horrified by possible great matches that were cut very short. <br /> <br /> The opening game was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I suppose the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect have had to put overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And it was the third pv in a row where Perfect worked. Remember before he never lost a fight. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were outstanding while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights, pinning Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a foreshadowing of Bret Hart's single career when he returned from the two-to-one and almost survived the battle. He and DiBiase put on a wrestling clinic, which makes us forget that the point of the fight was DiBiase's dull feud with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the visionaries were the first team to make all its members survive (and only the other since '87 having four survivors), this fight was not a squash. This was the longest fight of the night, and Jake repeated his '88 performance as he was left alone against four men and dominated. I think he could actually have pulled out. These days, the fight would have ended the other way round. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS matches ever was also one of its most surprising. Possibly the most underrated wrestler ever, Tito Santana was the inspirational breaker of the night, set on war painting and pinning Boris Zukhov, Tanaka, and even the warlord in the last survival battle. It was so weird to see him put over so overwhelmingly, so go back to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well to get rid of Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but it was just not a surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of the survival match was getting Hogan and Warrior to win together at the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the fighting was also short. The undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I want to remember this.
