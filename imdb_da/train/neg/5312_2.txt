Typical horrible garbage from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter (Teagan) commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute escaped alien beliefs Ross Hagen, who has mapped course for the earth. Soon, Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will protect a group of uncomfortably hammy college kids led by Richard Wiley, who ran across the garden with his RV on a camping trip gone wrong. Soon, the cyborg will blow away with its arm laser, burning an innocent alcoholic (Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire fame), proving that no-one will stand in the way of retrieving the prison cover whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body . The law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an ancient Vietnam war color with too much weapon stashed in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps intentionally made terrible, this shows which fans of "rancid cinema" are longing for. effects, actions and preconditions. At least the film PJ Soles has some eye candy .. even in '89 she was quite smokin '. This laser gun is probably fun .. It can burn some houses, but when Cyborg shoots by law, it hardly goes a mark on the spot that is fired.
