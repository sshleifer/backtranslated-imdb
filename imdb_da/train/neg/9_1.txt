This is one of the stupid movies I've ever seen. It almost always scratches a kind of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all. There is no single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought, and as far as that is concerned, there is nothing good to say, so I'm not saying anything. I honestly cannot understand how this kind of nonsense is being produced and actually released, somebody at some point believes: "Oh my god, it's really a push load" and call it a day. Its shit like this that has people downloading illegally sees the trailer as a completely different movie, at least if you've downloaded it, you haven't wasted your time or money. Don't waste your time, it's painful.
