I'm sure there is some kind of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K has made fun of. Having seen both this and "Werewolf" and reading dozens of comments on how they were undervalued, I was convinced that there is some conspiracy going on here. Many people say that people who hate it "are only afraid of doing", "Don't know good scare" or things like that. Well, I don't care about gore, but I want something in a movie! Mostly, only wife sitting around looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! A movie requires something to give it atmospheric, you don't get it by just having meaningless scenes where someone is walking around and staring. Oh, and "do you think"? Yes, I thought "MORE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I ever have the scene! <br /> <br /> P.s. For the record I am a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, That kind of thing.
