Much worse than the original. It was actually * painful * to sit through, and it hardly kept my six-year-old's interest. <br /> <br /> The introduction of some new Pokemon is marginally interesting, but the story is extra thin, the dialogue is still poor and music is mediocre. See the TV show instead - it's much better.
