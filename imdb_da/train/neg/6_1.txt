From the beginning of the film it gives the feeling that the director is trying to portray something that I mean to say that instead of history dictates the style in which the film is to be made, he has gone the opposite way he had some kind of movement which he wanted to make and wrote a story that fits it. And he has failed a lot in it. I think he was trying to make a stylish movie. In some way, I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the director's credit, he knows the media, which he works with, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen worst movies than this. Here, at least, the director has to maintain the continuity of the film. And the actors have also given a decent performance.
