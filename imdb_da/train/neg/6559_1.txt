My boyfriend picked this one; as a South born and raised African American, I found the plot and premise of the film completely without credibility. Believing that the class and racial disturbances would be so light and comfortable suspended would only come from a person who was totally unfamiliar with ante-bellum south. Absolutely absurd !!! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who is southern better) to join this shit
