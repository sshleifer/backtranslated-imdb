I've always been a big fan of Woody Allen and will always be for the most part of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how boring, meaningless, pretentious, and most of all horrendously acting this movie is. A vacuum mental masturbation based on inconsistent reasons. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a supposed "actor Allen clone" that sets in on Will Farrell's mouth and gestures, what Allen would have done in Farrell's place, he'd been 30 years younger. The result was of course ridiculous. And not to talk about the dialogues ... what was meant to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary blasphemy of intellectual reflection, unaware of its comical effect. How sad ...
