This is undoubtedly the only worst movie ever created. There are no arguments here. This is it. That's the way it is. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, looks like it was created by a three-year fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is simply stupid. It is unthinkable how someone might come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The witnesses are also completely paralyzed. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get lucky. If your morbid is curious about how bad this movie is, don't let me describe it. Words cannot express how terribly this movie is. It's not just bad as being a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its evil level by 5,000 and you still haven't come close to how horrible this movie is. Having given Pokemon the Movie a point, this movie gives a point seemingly nothing less than charity. It's so bad it is. Have the producers and the directors even taken film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It seems that some amateurs high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, take it back and request a refund. And don't even think about renting it again.
