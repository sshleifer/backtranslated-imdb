This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI bubbles and the amateurish special effects like close-up shots of false blood, making it very clear that the blood is strawberry syrup or another syrup variation. But I had thought I had seen all the possible lows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand in a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? It's the most important Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers in the rubbery socks. A talking hand comes out of the victims, and the vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter's team can talk to these rubber socks in the Transylvania. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And isn't that Transylvania in Romania? So don't they have to speak Romanian? Why would a small town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber boots with your fingers, clearly moving inside the aliens' heads; Then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are "Leatherfaces" that like to wear the faces of the faces. Then there are just the simple ugly, who all seem to have many faces. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their lovers who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack. Finally, if you think everything above is fun and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects, which make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes who are constantly fighting among themselves. Why should almost all Sci-Fi Channel movies use lead grades that are annoying, abrasive, rough or just unsympathetic? I found myself hoping they would talk rubber socks would win.
