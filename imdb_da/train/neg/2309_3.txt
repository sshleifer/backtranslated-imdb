I have a high tolerance for the weird, but frankly some movies go far beyond strange - so far that they hurt your brain. It's such a movie. Trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and I think the movie is best understood while taking drugs - it is so incomprehensible. The movie begins with some very cute Japanese animations involving a cat. But out of the blue, tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things - make me wonder if I lose something in the translation. But even if that's the case, why should we be treated to pictures of a magic trick involving a lady with a clever, stool, puking, lighting of fire animals, etc. All of this seemed really random and pretty awful. Strange, and I don't know why, some see this as a genius work. I just can't get it.
