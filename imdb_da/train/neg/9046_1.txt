Now for the truth is the very very weak story - for a Walt Disney movie its total nonsense. When Robinson shows up, the movies everywhere, I was shocked at how poor it was. It looks like "Alice in Wonderland" gone wrong! It feels like they were short on ideas, some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try to get away with it - and they don't. Then I sat there and wanted to end. My younger brother lost interest halfway through and became confused by the story. The signs are weak, and after the robinsons look, you don't care about the end, you just want the movie finished. It's a movie to forget and forget quickly. If you have a little free time, don't waste it on this.
