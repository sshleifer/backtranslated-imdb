You can give the JMS and boys a pass on this because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the film is still underperforming. Don't make me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I was an exe look this movie, I wouldn't have ordered the series. I don't like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are stupid, and there are plenty of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (except for Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set a fire in the series and it was a great play. If you are a B5 fan and have not seen this movie then watch it. If you are not a B5 fan, dont ... you will not see the series.
