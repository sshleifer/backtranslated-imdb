Having seen about half of this, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I continued to quit. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The action is bad --- much worse than what works in the 80s T&A film. There are several attempts at humor that fail badly and the movie is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager, this movie will hold some appeal, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how the movie will appear after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in pain and waiting for the final credits to roll. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this.
