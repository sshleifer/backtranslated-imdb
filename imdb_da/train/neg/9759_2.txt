It is rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this movie is very deserving because of how bad it was created and how confusing its product was. <br /> <br /> I felt a special attempt on the part of the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness they feel under oppression, but the film is shot and arranged in a way that we believe the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that the Palestinian teenager's position is parallel. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand that restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. I came out of the movie, feeling that the victim's mother was selfish in her grief and completely closed because of her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see damage from the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed words made the last meeting spiral out of control. It is more realistic that I see the Israeli mindset as the root of the problem; ignored reasons for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for recognition of the process by which the Jewish people acquired the land. <br /> <br /> I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which would normally be admirable in a documentary, but in view of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the example itself and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. In the end, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I recognize that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I am obliged to note the deficiencies in the direction of the heartbreaking and sad subject.
