Back in the 70s, when I first saw it, I was in high school. It was cool then. Now as an adult I look back on it and I say to myself. What was so funny? It has moments, but they are few and far between. It is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up. Show this to a younger crowd and they will be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor, you might want to stick with the Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From the Moon. Tunnel Vision and Groove tube are too dated to today's view.
