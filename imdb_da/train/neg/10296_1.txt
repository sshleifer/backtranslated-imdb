It was probably just my DVD --- but I wouldn't recommend anyone trying to see this picture on a DVD. I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some of the speakers still remained audible. If you are from Scotland, you might have a chance, though slim. People's voices were drowned by almost all surrounding sounds, including packing a package, footsteps and even puffing on a cigarette. <br /> <br /> When the volume reaches a level where voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene switches to a high environment, such as f eg. a disco. And you will hurt yourself to dive for the remote control to turn it down again. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art even in audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as a cruelty. <br /> <br /> half an hour I gave up as I had not seen anything else in redemption either.
