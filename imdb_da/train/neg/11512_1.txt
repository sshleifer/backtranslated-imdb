*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAIN HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what can happen to Madonna if she ever stranded on a deserted island. There is absolutely no challenge for Madonna in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can't even get it right. I know what you say you say, "How do you know what Madonna really is, you never met her!" Correct, I don't, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", not we? I know Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> In the year 2002 you think Madonna might have learned something in one way or another from the "crossover" ladies who have also made their way across the silver screen. For the sake of goodness, has Madonna not seen "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the movie world how it's done !!! Mariah kicks Madonna's trashy butt to the edge in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! All we see from this glimpse of Madonna's world is that she is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there's one thing to say to Madonna, she's consistent. When she was an MTV treasure, she put the world of women's fashion back 20 years. Now, in film, she has set women's roles in film and society back 20 years by glamorizing all the most incredible, horrible, reprehensible and evil qualities that women have claimed to have locked into them qualities they have so desperately tried to Prove that they really do not possess. <br /> <br /> *** HERE IS SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ WHEN FURTHER THAT DOES NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> Here is the one good thing I want to say about this movie and I was really impressed with it. They didn't go to "Hollywood Ending" - Madonna's character life. In the typical, happy Hollywood end, Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped man would have had the freedom to finally settle down with a good decent woman, a woman who would be the opposite of his late wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion she is rescued, and once again, this poor victim of a man is again saddled with his wife by a wife, and his life becomes yet another living hell. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ENDETH SPOILERS ***
