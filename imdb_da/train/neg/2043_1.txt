Horrible, horrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> A disappointing note at first and a few unpleasant autopsy does not make a good movie. Once again, I am amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a film production, and yet they have no pride in realizing that what they have done is a complete pile of crap. <br /> <br /> I was trying to think of a redeeming feature so I could at least balance my criticism, but the only one I could think of was that Pink's slot was pretty good .... I wonder on whether she's seen this? <br /> <br /> Look at your danger, the boredom can kill you.
