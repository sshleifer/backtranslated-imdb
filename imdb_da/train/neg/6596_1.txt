This is the kind of movie you see in gape-jawed, horrified silence, and yet continues to see, fascinated as if you see a train wreck in slow motion. But in the back of the mind, think: "Who on the ground green-lit this garbage?" <br /> <br /> Some of the previous user comments say things like "A great way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to children everywhere. That children would need some kind of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding about the nature of the children worldwide. Others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of Laurel and Hardy that I would answer: so what? One would think that rashes of movies BOMBS based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that simply cannot be recreated. The movies from Laurel and Hardy are easily accessible on video: why bother with that? <br /> <br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, a fine actor of the stage and screen ... well, all I can say is he must have been in trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, don't let go of the TV if this trash comes on!
