Sorry this movie didn't scare me, it just annoyed me. It was just as frustrating as I saw the potential, and it all went down the road. The children! Father! Formonitionen! Had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I've heard it all before. Daunting! None! I can scare myself alone here where I sit than they could in the movie. Are there men who write the figure that women should be so annoying? Huh? This film was completely atmospheric. Or at least it could have been if the director / writer had bothered it. We could have had a good music that would have added the excitement too, if anyone had made the effort. What I really want to know is why does it get the money? Just give it to me and save all that trouble. Abandoned? ... No, we where betrayed
