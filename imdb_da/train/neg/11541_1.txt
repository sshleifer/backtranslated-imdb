This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie have agreed to act in such worthless peace in the bin. The film is rape / stroke and revenge genre. Couples have gone to party and on the way back they hit deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes. He did not go to their car, instead he was kicked and well beaten while trying to drive the car engine that betrayed her and she was raped. Then she's once in her fathers house, and a villain is her neighbor, so she took shotguns and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenario! Bellow Hollywood! He was against the revenge, but "she was raped" "They laugh at her" so she must kill them all ... But once in the house she was contented by pushing the rifle's top into bad guys anus and walking away while he have become wild and do bad guys. Personally, I think the director runs out of money before he finishes it because the movie ends before they perform others who are involved in this rape and strike, which is not a big surprise because of course the sponsor has seen this and wanted to take back his money. LoL This movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they do not want to see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is to disturb that this peace of garbage has been made of British filmography, I like it and that is why I have seen this. Don't do it yourself, you have better things to do that look stupid scenarios ...
