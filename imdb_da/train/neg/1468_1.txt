Wonderfully cast wasted on worthless script. Ten or so adults reunited at the summer camp they attended as young. Could it ever happen in a million years? It is simply a fantasy and a boring thing about it. Will they be teens again? Do they restore their ghosts, games, good times? They can try, but in the end the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any excitement? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How anyone can be entertained by this drive is beyond me. I would like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
