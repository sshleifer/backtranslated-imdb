STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/> <br /> Alice who defeated Freddy at the end of The last movie is now trying to adjust its life. But her unborn child carries a demonic presence - Freddy trying to get back into their world. It is interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks to control Freddy movies - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins ( Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin have done a good job of it, Hopkins IMO has done some of the podge with this post, it should soon be forgotten. The story is clearly stretched as far as it can go here, with Freddy ridiculing a father himself and the ridiculous-looking demon baby. Although about an hour and a half it all becomes tiring and of course not scary. <br /> <br /> "Bon appetite, bitch" catch set is the only memorable point in this second wise very forgettable entry. *
