This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was great because it was so right, "like the people of the Ohio Valley are!" I'm from the area and I saw the movie as: "Like California people, we think we are!" I have lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there as a minimum wage job. We laughed a lot, we tied together and paused with people of our own age; the young people went together at night. The elderly had some spare time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in summer and not gloomy in winter rain elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Apart from "if you live in a manufactured home, you must be depressed" decommissioning, the story lacked elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. Martha's character was the worst drawn. It is doubtful that anyone who so oppressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she would probably have friends there. I've read reviews that seem to assume that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, more beautiful, and thinner", but if so, it's not shown. All we actually see is that Martha learns not to like Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends were of the same age and sex. We see that Martha feels left out during back sessions, without leaving the loop when social plans are made, used but not valued, and eventually disrespected and hurt. <br /> Just one thing: Should we assume Kyle of murder because he once had panic attacks? Please. This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level.
