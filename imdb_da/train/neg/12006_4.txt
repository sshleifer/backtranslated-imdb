OK director recreates LOVE CURRENTLY Director Nikhil Advani after debut with KHNH makes his second half and waits <br /> <br /> He makes a 3:30 hours + movie that loses on patience, time.etc The viewer works like a 3 hours sleeping to watch this movie <br /> <br /> OK they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the Anil-Juhi story convincing, but boring, no TV shows show such stories? <br /> <br /> We have the Govinda-Shannon story that is fun and works well <br /> <br /> We have the Akshaye-Ayesha story again credible but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and it is also slapstick boring comedy. <br /> <br /> We have the Salman-Priyanka story, which is the worst, not just terms, it makes no sense <br /> <br /> We have the Sohail-Isha story that makes you laugh, and the trick sometimes works thanks to the boredom set by most other stories. <br /> <br /> We have the John-Vidya story a good story in every respect <br /> <br /> But then all the stories come to pieces and the viewers get bored and sleepy. The Climax is not appealing especially the Climax in the Salman-Priyanka story Nikhil Advani's handling is okay in places, some stories are well handled but weak in places. Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs. Cinematography is great, each story is given a different look, texture and it works <br /> <br /> After a resignation with BB, the actors Govinda Rocks makes you laugh and love him in this movie despite his age and weight. Anil Kapoor plays his part well, although he looks out of form and tired John excels in his part, Akshaye Khanna overcomes a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is also over-the-top and Isha has nothing making Anjana Suknani's dismissal <br /> <br /> Priman and Salman deserve a prize for this movie you're shocked. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is not just acting, just talking as if he is asleep and the false accent, oh God Priyanka overcomes such a standard you want to throw something at her, she gets better at the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla's okay Shannon is okay
