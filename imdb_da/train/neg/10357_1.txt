I really didn't like this movie because it doesn't really bring the messages and ideas that L'Engle brought out in his novel. We had read the novel in our English class and I absolutely loved what I'm afraid I can't say the same for the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the custom version, and it just didn't matter to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is why I gave it such a bad rating. Don't watch this movie if you're a big fan of L'Engle's lyrics, because you're very disappointed. But if you watch the movie for entertainment (or educational as it was my case) then it's a good movie!
