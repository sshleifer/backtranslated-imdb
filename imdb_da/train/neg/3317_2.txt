I like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I couldn't stand Emma. I gave up on the book after 2 chapters, and at the end of the film I couldn't care less about Emma. She didn't seem to change at all. Perhaps it was Paltrows acting (as so excellent in the Se7) or my lack of interest in the movie. Do not know. The costumes are fine, but the dance was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 pretty much for the fact that Knightly is bloody beautiful, and though as a pretty patchy performance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his song.
