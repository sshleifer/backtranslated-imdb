I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but came on this movie last night at Showtime. The film looked good with the set design and the cinematography, but the manuscript was stolen and wood. The action was pretty bad - thought the two female managers were serviceable. You never really believed what the supporting actors said. There was the stereotypical-bible-throbbing Reverend without a glance at nuance, authoritative captain, hot-headed soldier, etc. I'm sorry to say it based on these shortcomings I immediately knew it as Canadian without knowing that it was such a telephony Canada than credits gave it away. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I missed something at first, but the hostility to the girls has never been explained. Here they are besieged in a fort of werewolves, and the men are wasting time and energy, which brutalises two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is a bit more of an urgent situation than your walls, rather than whether these girls are lesbians or not, it is just my introduction to the hostility directed at them. If they can aim and burn a gun, you might as well do well with them. The issue of their "immortal soul" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I suppose this relates to the rest of the trilogy, should these girls be the protagonists? One of them killed the Indian guy at the end who saved one of their lives. I suppose one is only a victim of his condition, which is not necessarily due to the blame in her actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve her happy ending.
