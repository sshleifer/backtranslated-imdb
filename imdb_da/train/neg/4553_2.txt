I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Be aware that the film is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points do not even appear in the film. It's at best a "B" movie. Many events, signs, how the character interacts and meets in the book, simply change or do not occur. The flow of events, which in the book is very smooth, is chopped and fed to the view as if you were a child. The character development is very poor. The personalities of the characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a "B" horror flick. I understand it would take six hours in film to present everything in the book, but the screen-based base lacked many points. The casting was very good.
