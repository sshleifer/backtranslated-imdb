I had been eagerly waiting for the first screening of this movie ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special place for it last night, I sat down to see it with my daughter (17 years and a film student), with chocolate of course with great expectation. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After just the first two minutes, we knew we were immersed. The shake camera shots and angles, generally poor filmography, direction and wood performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Despondent, we looked at. <br /> <br /> Anne, who played by Sally Hawkins, oddly and intentionally, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost 'I find you 'stalking fashion. Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with script and direction, blessing him. I hope they paid him well when he practically drowned at an apartment with a large wave that predictably violated the sea water and killed him and his associates. They were almost swept out to sea. Health and safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left with spit water to deliver his line. Probably there was not enough money left in the kitty for resuming this scene. Anyone with any sense would not have tried it on such a day in the first place. Other than Mr. Penry-Jones gave Alice Krige the only compelling performance as Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by Anthony Head's convincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott. <br /> <br /> Against the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth seemed to be strangely grace Anne with a second visit every second, which has had great pain to avoid her for the bulk of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impedance that made him forget his reason for being. In contrast, Anne ran high-flowing from pillar to post after seeking the good captain, who had meanwhile managed to call almost all of Bath, we are told in just three or four minutes without having a sweat. <br /> <br /> We didn't see any of Anne's charms that cross the screen. In fact, we were left to wonder what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, effortless, meaningless Anne and why someone, someone, didn't say wing Sir Walter just to close his heel. <br /> <br /> The decisive kiss, usually our favorite piggy moment, was painfully pulled out. As they walked closer, Anne held open and closed her mouth, which had an effect on the screen to make her look like she was gum before the lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing about last night was chocolate and half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> What a shame to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story filmed in some of England's finest scenes. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
