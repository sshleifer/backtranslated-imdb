Swayze does not make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; Who grew up was my ultimate hero in film like 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "The Capturer of Zenda" and 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Swayze completely fails. Even the depiction of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in the "Extraordinary Gentlemen League" was very good in an otherwise big flop. Alison Doody also lacks Deborah Kerr's grace in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least, the impressive Siriaque in Umbopa's role makes it very difficult for anyone to fill his (shoes) !!! For anyone who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I strongly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version.
