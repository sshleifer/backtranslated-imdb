I can't believe how horrible this movie turned out to be. I feel magical, even referring to it as a "movie". The action was flat, editing was terrible, and the plot left many big questions unanswered. The premise was OK if unoriginal: a small group of foreigners live in the United States and try to slow down humanity. But it goes downhill quickly from there. How could they convince a "human" to accept a stranger as his wife to make the alien human hybrids they need? They show a larval stranger, but never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect-looking skin on an industrial scale. They throw in the obligatory big alien monster with teeth. The end was almost too painful to see. I suppose I am mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have something to do with this. How could he say to the great alien monster with teeth: "Get away from him, your son of a b * tch" with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
