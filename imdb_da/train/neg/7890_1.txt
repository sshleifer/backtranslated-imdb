How sad there is no way to send a mark lower than 1. I saw this nonsense and could hardly believe what I saw. Every part of the movie was horrible. Music, action, direction, history, everything, simply everything. I actually found myself laughing at various points in the movie. I especially loved the bit where our hero is blowing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion, and knocking the clipboard out of the nurse's hand, because ........... well. Just because. Product placement? Crossfish is (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are of Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out more.
