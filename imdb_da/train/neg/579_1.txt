Listening to the director's comment confirmed what I had suspected while watching movies: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play by making a movie. The reason is the kind of thing that cheats teens when they go through the "I could write a book / manuscript / award winning sitcom" phase. There is a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because it is a sequel to someone else's movie), but it is completely buried under a signed, poorly executed and ridiculously uninterrupted script. <br /> <br /> The lines are bleak and the performances are non-engaging, but again I tend to blame the director. He does not seem to have consulted the players at all about what is required, rather plonked the script into their hands, pointing the camera at them and telling them to continue with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these players could have acquitted themselves better (say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in the leading man). <br /> <br /> As it stands, no body has thrown at all. A beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampire parallel has gone up as he gets a transfusion to infect Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his accompanying co-hunter. She should have bitten him. They should have looked vaguely interested in each other in the rest of the movie as well. The only real moment of sexual excitement, between the two female leaders, is by the directors' own access by chance. He originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more meaningless plot exhibition - so I assume that the finished product could have been made worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as movies go, this is badly plotted, silly and forgettable. Even as trashy movies go it is not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and bloody little drum, but the director has left more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons.
