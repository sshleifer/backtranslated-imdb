I'm a big, big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I'm a little less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> This said I should have loved 1408. <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I went eagerly. I went out disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the actor's fault. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the film's performance puts Cusack in the scene "guy in a closed room". <br /> <br /> It wasn't a bad movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of "ouch, it's just wrong" combined with moments of "ouch, it's just painful" and moments of "oh, now it's just unfortunate" with very little continuity connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once and there is no apparent connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we look like while trying to survive the space. <br /> <br /> An earlier commenter described the Olin / Enslin argument as worth seeing and I very much agree. But apart from that, apart from some clever musical characters (the space almost suddenly plagues Enslin a little, and gives him a chance to get out before he behaves ante ... at which point it gives him an hour of countdown time and the title bar from the carpenters " We are just starting out. "" It's mostly "things going out on you when you least expect it!" kind of scare that was fun when I was fourteen and surrounded by friends of my age and clung to each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was "let's get him to relive some of his most painful experiences" mindgaming, with "let's animate the paintings in scary ways" clich√© cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the actors I mentioned above . <br /> <br /> We never find out the origin of the evil. We will never see evil defeated, even though we may suspect it was defeated. <br /> <br /> And the end was just a crushing "What?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for cable to come. I didn't want to pay for it as a matinee, but I feel a little shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it.
