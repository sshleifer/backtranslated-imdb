One can say that the actors want to make a movie, but it clearly shows that the statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this movie lack something to hold on to. They play the part of cardboard cuts that are being moved in predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It can be summed up in a few words, but I hold back if anyone wants to see this movie. I had to speed up the parts where Jack showed us how to be an unpleasant eating. I have to say that 70% of this movie was about cooking, dining or getting ready to eat. Frankly, I would rather not spend my time chewing Jack with an open mouth. Personally, I could have done without footwear references and jokes that also pepper the first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> Outside my own personal dementia, the film really lacked something that was worth it. There were countless scenes and cameras that felt it was pulling. When something happens, the characters' reactions are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It is best not to see this one up.
