I know that some movies (I mean: European films), which are very bad movies, are considered great cinema by some "critics" only because they are non-American. I saw the 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and noted the fact that this was selected for some major festivals. Don't let this fool you! Unless you are one of those people who like crazy movies like this and call it great art afterwards, skip it! The film contains a hilarious scene after another (a similar Italian movie appeared in my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these movies is that they are not only boring, like some other weirdly acclaimed movies, but they almost play as a camp. I mean, let's look it up, the play is terrible (I mean: soap opera level), the story doesn't have a surprise (it's been done endlessly before connecting several stories: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, GAMES BY HEART, only much better), not a realistic character in it (something true freak-seeing along the way, note the hilarious zombie-like daughter), and so on etc. As if that's not enough, the movie is 135 min. (count it!) long, and at the end the director opens his sentiment box. After a movie with such a hilarious poor dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening, laugh at so much incompetence, well ... It is an insult to the cinema and receives only high ratings because it happens in another language in this case Spanish. We live in strange world in ... 3/10
