By reviewing this film, I can only go into my experiences as a weekend warrior, doing my basic training in July, August, and September 1971 in that land on Earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take High Ground was not something I remember basic training. But one must remember at the time when this was post Korea, which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war that we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war, where we held slopes of jokes in an infinite pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome but accepted as still necessary for country defense. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a veteran in Korea who is now assigned state side to train troops to travel abroad. The film is about one of his training bikes and the men in the platoon he has to train. They are the usual kind you would find in almost any war movie from the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I want to praise you for is The High Ground, the fact that MGM acknowledged our army was now an integral part of William Hazard's presence as a black recruitment platon. It was in line with the spirit of the times when there was a change. <br /> <br /> But I would say that a recruiter like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured by his clever mouth from day 1. Richard Widmark would not have risked death or become eunuch to give Jerome Courtland confidence in a weapon . And by no means would he have worried so much about Robert Arthur's deserting. He just let the MPs deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas gave Give High Ground authenticity. But watch it as an army recruitment movie, and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly backed the day. <br /> <br /> I remember that the bartenders have their little conflicts that you could pick up when you were not worried they were going to get your case for 95% of the time. But it is not in any way that Karl Malden would have turned Widmark into the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that it would have undermined authority, something the military just didn't allow. <br /> <br /> I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like his talented cast talented director Richard Brooks, even the stupid theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington. fresh from their Oscar one year earlier for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and the story of Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's lively imagination.
