... from this horrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this movie, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. It is amazing that something is rising to the top and proving to be the absolute worst. The music! I noticed that the film has two composers listed. This should be the reason why each frame has music, the absolute worst "D" movie style drive. They have never heard of the term "less is more". It was so painful to listen to, I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You have to be upset by Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I am sure they did not see roles like this in the twilight of their career. See it at your own risk.
