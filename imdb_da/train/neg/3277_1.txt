If you've ever seen Dukes of Hazard, you know you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or gross behavior seen by young children. If you've seen the movie you know, it's no longer the case! This movie was HORRIBLE! Main characters who make drugs and think it's fun and cool are definitely not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and turned it into waste. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, now looks and seems to be listening to the street corner and being paid for her services. I was so excited to watch this movie before it came out, 15 minutes in the movie I was ready to leave. I kept thinking that it might get better, but instead it got worse at the moment. I wish I had never seen this movie. It broke a good show and left nothing but terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, see something worth your money because it is not just a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours in your life, you will never come back!
