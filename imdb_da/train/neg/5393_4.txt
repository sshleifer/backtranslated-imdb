I am a Shakespeare fan and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh has done to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of viewers. But this movie lacks to convey the overall intentions of the game with the ridiculous musical sequences. Add it with Alicia Silverstone's stumble over the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in much Ado about nothing) and other badly cast roles, all of which correspond to a tireless endurance of seeing.
