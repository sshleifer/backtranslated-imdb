This is actually a pretty bad movie. The ideology is not as perverse as in the films Collins made later. But my biggest doubt about the movie is that it is unreliable and honestly boring for a long time. The whole concept of an ex-SAS man who does not participate in terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing, and you cannot help wondering why a group of highly-organized terrorists (who later become rather clueless) fall for it . The movie starts with a pretty powerful scene, but then winds for a long time up to the grand finale. All in all, I think who dares to win could have been an interesting 45 minute episode of The Professionals, but the story doesn't carry a feature film. Although reasonably successful at the time, this film began to leave Collin's career, which in the 1980s mainly made inexpensive and dubious soldier-of-fortune or army films. Too bad because he is actually a very versatile actor, but at the end of the day Martin Shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that is still successful.
