Almost as boring to see as it was to read, Evening is a gorgeously produced failure ... until Meryl Streep enters and silently shows his other cast members how to act this kind of thing. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher. Perhaps, if Vanessa and Claire had changed roles, we could have seen the liveliness of the young Ann giving her the entrance to the rare story of history, and we could have imagined that the older Ann was actually dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out in the jumping storytelling, but unfortunately. It gave me a headache.
