Schlocky '70s horror movie ... you must love them. In contrast to today's dull slasher flicks, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie about the production of a B movie ... that went horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an over-the-hill, B movie queen who makes a film about a series of pigs murders that took place in a family in their home. Her boyfriend / instructor, who looks and works like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on the spot and on a tight schedule. The Ken doll's co-star discovers a book of Tibetan chants that they work in the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine has gradually given up seeing the 17th Church (The Unearthly), now showing a humble existence as a caretaker for property. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to run from the director. <br /> <br /> The fear builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine, who enters a grave there and finally culminates in seven, yes, seven murders. (In any case, there is truth in advertising.) It's just sad that ghoul didn't understand there was a movie made over him. How was poor faith knowing that the darn Tibetan chants really wanted to work? Face it, you just can't walk around on Satan's coat and expect him to take it down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says performing an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses.
