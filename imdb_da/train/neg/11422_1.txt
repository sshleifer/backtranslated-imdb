I saw this in the theater when it came out, and yesterday I saw it again on cable. This I was able to relive myself with the feeling of how the rebellion this movie is. The whole pile of characters are self-absorbed narcotics performers. The worst of it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20-something dating, even as it aims to celebrate people "to find themselves". The nice guys end up last, the jerked guys do it really well, the strangest guys do best. The girls are all boy toy pushovers. Only one sign ("Wendy") is seen doing something externally useful to society, and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a thrown one-night stand with a scumbag in a luxuriantly busy scene that we must think is romantic. What this really is is Hollywood's concept for young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, imagined.
