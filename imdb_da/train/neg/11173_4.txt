If it wasn't for the bad dialogues and scripts. I mean, the direction was really in touch with that topic. The actors did well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, what was really lacking was a solid script to hold all pieces together. I would highly suggest not seeing this. Unless you are an Al Pacino enthusiast as I am and want to see everything he plays in. Even though the result is rather poor. This is another very bad movie for this actor after S1m0ne, who once knew how to choose roles.
