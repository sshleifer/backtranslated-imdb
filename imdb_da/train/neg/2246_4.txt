I have never seen the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so have no comparisons. It has also been some years, but I did not find this narrative nor gripping or its romance captivating. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn-out, disillusioned rock star on the decline and embarks on a romance with a fresh and talented new sense of humor, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline. <br/> <br /> The main players, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are sufficient in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. The film is remarkable for me for only one aspect, Streisand's beautiful reproduction of Oscar's winning song 'Evergreen'. She really has a strong and magnificent voice.
