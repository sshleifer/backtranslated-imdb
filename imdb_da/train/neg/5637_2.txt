I understand that I want to make a movie that is edgy and different. I understand the previous reviewers comments that this is an error understood movie. My point is, as soon as this movie ended, my first comment was: "This is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ..... she uses her father's money to make a film she wrote, leads and pays for ..... of course that close to the movie to realize that there was no sign development and no directions like a beginning, middle and end ..... the voyeur part was good and edgy but what was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, find some pictures, screw the caretaker, came out on a very cold night (not credible) to check on the noise and run over her caretaker lover .... movies ending ...... anyone educate my ignorant asses ?? I really want to know what the meaning is .... what was the director's vision ..... why no development of the dead lover? Why no caretaker background? What is the night view? What is the point of lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why tell us about a escaped mental patient / peeping empty? What's with the urn? Oh, and the lamp is what is supposed to indicate if the house is? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker feel that it was his house? that aspect was never pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... i rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters ..... write back and tell me what i need to learn. ... I'm just a mother in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
