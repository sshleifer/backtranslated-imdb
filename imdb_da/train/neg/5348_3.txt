Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking / expanding machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) get ready for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) voluntarily take care of Adam while his parents are gone, but luckily that title would get you expect), the adults are accidentally provided with Wayne's shrinking beam. As the kids run amok, their miniaturized people have to fight with monstrously large insects, wrinkles in the rug that resemble canyons and other threats to them. This was bad, like most straight to video sequels are, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was kind of ridiculous. I had to laugh at the movie "roach" Stuart Pankin and the party became even more ridiculous, watching at your own risk!
