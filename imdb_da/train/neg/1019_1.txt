Honestly before I saw this movie, I had heard many people say this movie was a disgrace. I didn't think since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie and saw it alone. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and constantly wondering during the movie - why in the hell did I see this movie. Of course, I don't expect much from Justin, as he doesn't really belong in movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I couldn't stop asking myself why they agreed to attend Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe you think the players suck, then I need to pay more attention to the story. In fact, the story is the core of a movie, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie you will give a credit for its story. Imagine this, a smart-ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was backed by an agent who still has the heart to justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). At the end they beat the system with a happy closing story. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I couldn't even continue this. Just remembering the movie makes me sick already. My advice boys, don't see this! Please save your money and time for another movie.
