Oh my GOD, it was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie goes far too seriously ... unless of course it was supposed to be fun. I saw the last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the whole audience laughed at each scene. I think my favorite was 'do not study medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could manage in the character Nicalo's only line "we want to be together ... that's our destiny." I'm sorry, but after the first time the words lost the whole meaning. <br /> <br /> And what was the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this as a lesson to the Americans: You can't animate so please try not. You only embarrass yourself.
