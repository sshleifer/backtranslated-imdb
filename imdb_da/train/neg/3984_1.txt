I watched this movie a few years back on the BBC, I sat through it. How? I don't know, it's far away in "so bad the good" charts Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman have to call when they see it now. I think Woody Allen would have worked wonders with the outlandish plot, and Baldwin's part might have been played with gusto by Leslie Nelson. It was on again tonight I tried to see it again, but life is too short. the few minutes i watched was for the lovely Nicole she was so hot about 93, has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman played his stock in the trade "nice but dim" character the F word comes out of the mouth when the lady from "phrasing" miscast oath as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong. Stay away.
