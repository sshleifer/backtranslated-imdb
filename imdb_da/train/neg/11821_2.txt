Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie here I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad error I've seen 950+ movies and this is really one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting', soundtrack (movie's only song - a lame country melody) played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and uncomfortable and is boring to the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the film's final credits. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while it is far from his best performance, he seems to be doing a bit of effort. One for Keitel obsessives alone.
