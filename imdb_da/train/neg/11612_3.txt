Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time it is a movie played for sleeve ?? laughing. On a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as expected, encapsulated in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by the man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately in danger when he has to investigate some mafia types that turn the tables on him, and he himself has been found to be the main abuser, he must now go on the move and hope to resolve the matter alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the shameful jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to foxy Raquel Welch, but unfortunately he fails in this ham fisted vanity project. The genuinely ridiculous decomposition that surrounds every woman is quite astounding, every woman in the movie is a piece of head that likes to bend over, is in front of the camera, commits Douglas Douglas to zoom in on the cracks on their donkeys every time as they bend their posterior muscles. There is even a ridiculous campy gay character who begs for faith, it was a movie made by "real men" for "real men" to confirm their own fluttering sexuality, it is a shameful shame.
