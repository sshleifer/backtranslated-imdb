"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I have ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The actors appear to be recruited on uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> They go and walk through the woods. There is more walk-around than in all three parts of the "Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour I started reading a Porsche brochure while I was watching "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I would give the movie 0 stars out of 10, as this is not possible, I must give 1 star.
