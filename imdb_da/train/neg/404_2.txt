Shortly after watching this movie, I questioned the mental competency of any actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why should she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I need to give credit where credit is due. Some moments in the film were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the crooked perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman who has any kind of self-respect to count on.
