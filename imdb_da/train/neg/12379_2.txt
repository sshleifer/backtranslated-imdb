Based on the positive reviews above, we saw a free screening of this night. Now I know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these. "Destined to become a" cult classic "" ?? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and family of the production crew, because only a few of us went out in the first hour. The songs were the most literal I've ever heard in a musical ?? "Don't take the short circuit, baby, there's a wolf in the woods." Debi Mazar's eyes flashed furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most tunes lasted for only a few lines. Now whoever plays the wolf in this story must be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, ex N'Syncer, who lives up to his last name, as he is not aged well. He is not exactly relieved with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school quality makeup and out-of-tune song. Seriously was this guy in vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-fitting, but can't do much about the imaginative script. You know it is possible to write to adults and children at the same time ?? see under "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the virtual sets looked good and were well integrated with the actors. And it wasn't as offensive as "Crash".
