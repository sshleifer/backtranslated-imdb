Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London and the reason is so ill-researched that it is ridiculous. No one could be terrorized on the London Underground. In a short time it is not in use every night, there are teams of maintenance workers out there who control the tracks and perform repairs, etc. The fact that there are homeless people living in there is just as unlikely. Or it is even possible to get locked in and not have access to a cell phone in this day and age ... The worst thing that will probably happen if someone found it after the last train is that they can get graffiti sprayed on them . Although this has been under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in history. (Remember in London as a whole, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it had been put in a city I am not familiar with, I might have enjoyed it through ignorance but it's not a high quality movie, so I just couldn't put myself in suspension of my unbelief and try it for the trivial little story that it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating existed! Possibly the most disappointing movie I ever thought I would have.
