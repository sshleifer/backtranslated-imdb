I've seen many horror shows over the years, like the Nightstalker dealing with the Wendigo legend, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit that caused chaos to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man I was wrong. The whole film creates this sense of events happening that will be frightening and scary, but then delivers a very simplified tale of revenge and murder over the loss of a property. Ve-ery scary - not! This movie has much in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> Believing in what Hollywood is putting on scary movies is getting harder and harder as they rarely come through with something original and scary. Which idiots pay for such a fake movie to be made? Go back to the drawing board and do something useful with the millions of greenbacks you have to throw around.
