I rejoice for films that fill object differences in the world cinema. So after watching the trailer for "Water Lilies", I expected to like this movie because I thought I had stumbled upon something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - kind of a female version of "Beautiful Thing" . <br /> <br /> The main characters are young French women 15 years old. Marie is slim, reticent and beautiful in a tomboyish way; Floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, pudgy, and behaviorally immature. The erotic relationship between Marie and Floriane always sucks in this movie, if not on the surface, then just below it. <br /> <br /> "Water lilies", however, are not about killing lesbian love on two teenagers; It is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working for cross purposes and - in at least two cases - joyless, mechanical sex. It also shows that scriptwriters and filmmakers mark their own creations as they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the extra features of the "Lord of the Flies" DVD, director Peter Brook says, "French cynicism begins with the uprising of sex", meaning that the French consider children as angels while they consider young people and adults with a penetrating cynicism. Part of the decline in this movie is the filmmaker Celine Sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where's the joy?" I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be pleasing and triumphant erotic in a fresh, life-conscious way. These positive aspects are missing from this film; There is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organic, this movie will be an exciting celebration of first love. But Sciamma is also impressed by his own cynicism and wisdom and destroys the film. First, what is the purpose of showing only the lumpy girl nude? I know there is a firm tradition of tasteful adolescence in European cinema, as evidenced by films such as "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably, The Little Thief, The Wall of the Heart, Friends, Beau Pere" and "Europe, Europe "; but this occurrence is a petty-authorized break-in - "Watch the audience, I can make a movie where I only show the incomparable person naked." Neither nudity nor evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to go. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie dance. The next does not only follow Floriane, who cynically manipulates Marie; It is the filmmaker Sciamma who cynically manipulates his audience. <br /> <br /> The greatest betrayal of authenticity and ecological honesty occurs when Floriane warns Marie that she is requesting something that is "not normal". Marie understandably asks: "Who cares to be normal?" Then Sciamma falsely plays with her audience and the film's rapid momentum, because Florian's request is a false, derived and substitute question - not the authentic, profound question, the film, Mary's character, and the viewers who have invested their time deserve. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments clinging fake to the viewer's nerves: 1) When do the French - of all people - bathe on swimwear and with a turtle to start? 2) Which teenager - of any nationality - will chomp down on an apple core that has been thrown into the garbage to get a taste of the beloved mouth? <br /> <br /> The three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, can become excellent players. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technology and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism that is unmistakable. In the future, she could play anything from an emotionally stunted librarian to a mysterious sensual seducer to a restrained politician who ran a meteoric rise in recognition. All in all, the "water lilies" were very disappointing. Would an honest movie maker please make an authentic movie about two young women who fall in love! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have some quality they can see and identify with. And yes, to fill out a topic difference in the world cinema.
