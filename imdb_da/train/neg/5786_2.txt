When you look at this now and hear the whole language here, it is amazing that this was rated "PG", but it is the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk plays the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! But few people consider it offensive, and certainly not the scumbags that make movies or the people who "evaluate" them. <br /> <br /> The cast is a clue as to how profane this movie can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors you wouldn't find in "The Sound Of Music. " <br /> <br /> I like heist movies and many movies by director William Friedkin, but this script doesn't deliver and it just has too much of "Sleazy 70s" feel it visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TV's "Columbo", it must come as a shock to hear that he uses as much profanity as he did in film. This is far from the only case.
