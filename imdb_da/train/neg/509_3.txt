This film is about British war prisoners from World War II escaping from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find "The Wooden Horse" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been exciting, exciting and adrenaline burned, but "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very common way. It is a collection of ordinary and ill-told events, without suspension and excitement. The first half clearly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so clear, with not enough blunders and close shaving to get me to the edge. The last half of the movie is even worse, they just move from one place to another without any cat and mouse hunting. And the characters can talk a little less and get more action in an action movie! I am disappointed with "The Wooden Horse", it wasted the potential to be a good movie.
