What ever you do, do not play your time on this pointless. movie. A remake that did not have to be recalled. Everyone who came out of the theater had the same comments. Worst movie I've ever seen. Save time and money! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage cycled down the hills, swam in dark water and rolled down the hills while being attacked by bees, yet his dress was still perfectly pressed and shirt sharply white until the very last scene. Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the play was as incredible as the movie itself. It's great how good actors can make such bad movies. First they get a copy of the script. If you still have any interest in watching the movie at least wait for it to come out on DVD.
