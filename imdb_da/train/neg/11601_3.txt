A nightmare on Elm Street: The dream car, the fifth episode on the Elm Street series nightmare and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than a nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the nightmare on Elm Street DVD box for my birthday and I saw all the successors. The dream bar was the worst without a doubt, I was also surprised when they did so well with the last two successors. But I suppose they just lost the charm, the story was just ridiculous and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice just got more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so she just carried this movie on her own. Freddy also loses his scare, it just got a little stupid. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she wears a baby, she couldn't be happier with her life. But Freddy is also back, and he won't be too bright on her when she defeated him so easily in the fourth film. But at least he wants his child and is born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy also had parents? That's what is a nightmare on Elm Street: The dream child examines, and Alice quickly finds out what Freddy's childhood was, and that is perhaps the only thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is just a bad movie and an insult to the series. I don't think anyone could be happy with this successor. Just the story was really silly, I think it might have worked, but once again it was just done the wrong way. I know that if you are looking to see the sequel to the nightmare on the Elm Street series, you should see it, but I really don't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
