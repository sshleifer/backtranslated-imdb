Considering the ability to write, direct and star in my own movie, I would probably choose something about robotic women with weapons. However, Anthony Hopkins decided to make the weirdest movie that anyone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is a film that is so strange that even David Lynch is likely to look at the person next to him and say "What happens?". <br /> <br /> This is a movie where in a scene, a man crosses the road to a yellow car facing right, which suddenly changes into a pink car facing left. This is a movie where two characters have a conversation scattered with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls. This is a movie in which a man begins to talk about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" only for the actor of that movie to suddenly appear as himself (and then disappear into thin air). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot right out of the window and use fifteen different edits while doing so, and to switch from black and white to color for apparently no reason at all. <br /> <br /> However, I commend Hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie (some of which depict more characters). Everyone involved throws themselves into their roles, though they probably have no idea what they actually do. My favorite here was Christian Slater's slave in a hat that was impressively threatening while it was babblende nonsense and sang the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins has been quoted as saying he made this movie a joke, and it may be the best way to summarize "Slipstream". It's a joke on the audience. You will see it from the beginning to the end, trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come only to find that the answer never actually does. What the punchline for this particular joke is, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier, and I'm a big fan of that director. I guess Anthony Hopkins shares my love for similar "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as any of Lynch's movies despite imitating many of his techniques (though I was surprised to find that no one is talking backwards in "Slipstream"). It's all too chaotic and random - as another reviewer here pointed out, it's the movie version of Alzheimer's disease. There is undoubtedly a small number out there that can see this and draw some of it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience created only by Hopkins involvement. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
