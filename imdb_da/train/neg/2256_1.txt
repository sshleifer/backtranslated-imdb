I will admit that I have seen maybe five minutes with "Jerry Springer". I don't consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm over to see what's on his show. You should try to raise yourself too. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social event I was leading. I was told that this movie really had a bit to do with Springer himself, but it was centered on the lives of those who would look at "Springer". Managed better, this movie may actually have been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives are. I will admit that I felt a force of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all she has in life. How sad she feels she should go to Jerry's show to solve this. <br /> <br /> I feel really sorry that Molly Hagan is appearing in this. Have you noticed that after this movie she has been mainly referred to "B" roles on television? I will say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her acting and she tries to play her roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan cannot carry a scene alone. She just doesn't have what it takes to play a leading role. Her best work will always be Angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that wasn't great, but her heart was in the right place) and when she visited "Seinfeld" as sister Roberta.
