The fact that there are positive comments to Dan in Real Life on IMDb just makes me realize that their junket employees are hard at work and are trying to get people to see this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, no idea where to start describing the really horrible movie I was through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films made me believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so constructed, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the movie has been so many times before I am shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and move on to this scary bad movie and don't believe everything you read on IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in another theater and watching a good movie.
