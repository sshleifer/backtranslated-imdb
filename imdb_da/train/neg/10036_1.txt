Sometimes I do not understand what the directors think when making a movie ... I had a trauma after seeing the welcome (2007) and thought they would do it again. But after lots of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended up as a heart attack. Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, lots of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting except to see Kareena after her big weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music another great disaster ... in the music album, they have spent time giving pathetic small dialogues of these 4 jokers, and they have not thought of giving the scene the background song when Akshay Kumar makes stunts ...! the song is so nice, quite similar to Tashan Mein, and it's not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you are planning to watch this movie, I would say, watch it to listen to the background song that looks like something ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> Overall very disappointed though with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempts to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away man, I need to puke!
