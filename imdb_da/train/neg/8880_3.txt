This movie was but it could have been much better. There are some scary moments, but there aren't enough of them to make me watch this movie again. There are some scenes you could fast forward and not miss anything. The biggest mistake is that it's so predictable, and that's why I rated it so low. It can be seen, but don't expect anything good.
