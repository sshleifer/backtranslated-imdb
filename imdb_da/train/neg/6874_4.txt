Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) has directed and interpreted this strange film, which is the second part of a kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I don't think this movie is part of the Dogma '95 manifest, even though it really looks like it. I'm not really sure what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They deliver pretty good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I don't know there's anything about the movie I don't like. Sex scenes are too long. It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of shit I don't know exactly where it says. Sure, it's not a bad movie, but I don't suggest people to see it, nor will I tell them not to see. Just do whatever you want. If you feel curious and you are open, try it, you like it.
