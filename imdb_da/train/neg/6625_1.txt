This is the first time I write a comment on a movie on IMDb. but I had to write it to this one. There are 3 hours of unadulterated torture. from the start you get the idea that the film gets bad. the action is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay Devgan (loved him in Bhagat Singh), but he's at his worst in this movie. Amitab seems to have worked hard for this, but somehow lacks fear. prashant raj is a non-actress. and the most annoying part of the movie is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took her in this movie. background score is repetitive. Somehow, I felt that ramu was trying to repeat a sarcasm, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work. PLEASE DO NOT SEE IT
