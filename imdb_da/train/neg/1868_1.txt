This movie is horrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (the Italian dubbed version, at least). If you like waste ... real trash can, give it a try but beware: this is not "so bad, it's good" kind of flick. In its fairness it can really look like a porn, but believe me, if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even a regular erotic thriller, find something else in the store! I tell you this, for the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing recording, action, plot, dialogues (the only good lines I said earlier are those they stole from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) Will carry you to tears in a few minutes and the "happy end" is utterly disgusting! I give it a star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after the "monologue's eyes" (also stolen from 8MM) and a half for mother and daughter's sexy bodies (failed to keep me awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
