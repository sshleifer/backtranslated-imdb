After seeing Awake, I was looking for a conclusion: Director and screenwriter Joby Harold did Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator, for simply the movie is full of ridiculous elements. Wake up has many plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniformly uses the main character's spirit ... did the doctor's ghost in the floor?). The concept behind this movie is a bit ingenious, but all plot holes and absurd things make this a stupid and crappy movie. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all the actors bring bad performances. Hayden Christensen has zero expressions, as is Jessica Alba. The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is enormously wasted on his role. Wake laughs and laughs. It is so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it is impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this crappy movie.
