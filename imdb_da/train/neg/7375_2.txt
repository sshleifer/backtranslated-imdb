This movie was greatly appalled by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as I should say Steven so boring! Like before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to rename his own lines and leave someone to mimic his voice to the shots where the sound should be blunted. A couple of movies before this was that he did it too, but I don't think so! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course everything is said, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better without Seagal who has become a cartoon of its own. Do not want to. Everything over a buck to this one is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal movie. What has taken me so long to realize this?
