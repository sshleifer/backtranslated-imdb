I got this as a turkey movie and was not disappointed. It is - together, though many have been in other films, it is clear that they have to work hard to act so badly so constantly throughout this film with the unintentional release of some action. <br /> <br /> Plot - be generous I could say that the script originally started with a plot, but did its best to ignore it. the plot broke faster then a Chinese knock computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. The majority of the lines of the characters were at best pathetic to be indiscreet. The script worked hard to ensure that no characters managed to be considered memorable. I've seen other films where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short buses special <br /> <br /> Management - until you can come up with your own steering ability, you can copy the style to your favorite director otherwise you will only make mistakes like this. <br /> <br /> It is good to know that your friends / family have given you 10 stars for this movie
