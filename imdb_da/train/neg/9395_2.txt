This series is interesting to see as a MST3K function, but for today's audience it is all it is. I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952. Given this fact alone, this makes a solid (low?) 2 in my book. The used cars do not even look modern, they look like things from the 30s. It's basically Cody (the only world's salvation? Sheesh speaks of an insult to everyone else, such as the military), yet it's Cody in his nipple ring flying suit against Graber and Daley two stupid ss henchman, as a sports weapon and an occasional jet gun pretty lame in itself, enjoy. If you want to see a really good serial see Flash Gordan, it is full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also beautiful women, this has none of it. And Flash was made 15 or so years before this crap, so you can give it a little slack. Something made in 1952, this badly deserves a 2. Nuff said. give it a 6, if you see it as an MST3K episode, the guys have some fun with it; a tweak of nipples here, a tweak there and I fly! And now as an added bonus, I bring you to the Commander Cody Theme song that was originally sold by Joel and his two character Tom Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br / > Song in the beginning credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR VIEW COMMANDS CODY ....
