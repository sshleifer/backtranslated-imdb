From opening dialogue and scenes, I knew I knew I was in a train wreck. Didn't want to see but couldn't turn away. If it wasn't for more eye candy of this movie, I'd have given a star. The fact that the interaction between character and relationship behavior was so far fetched, added by poor direction and terrible history makes this movie no more than a low budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good movie. But this movie fails so terribly that there was no chance to return. <br /> <br /> Standing in the woods, your childhood's best friend of an unknown disease died, other friends who died around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A. Drive away from everyone and try your luck alone. B.) Have sex with your friends boyfriend. C.) Take a warm bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. D.) Bash in the head of your childhood's best friend and lifelong love with a shovel. E.) All above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so far taken. In fact, everyone is likely and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film into the bone bucket of your local rental shop. Stay away. Stay far away.
