Terrible! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, action, mood, sound etc. Seems to be done by day care students ... wait, I've seen programs better than this. Opening like a soft porn show with a blurred naked woman making a shower, it goes badly from there. Good naked scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the film. At times I would swear I could hear roaring of the camera's engines. YIKES! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. This group of actors and crews need more actors and film lessons. Aligned 1 out of 10.
