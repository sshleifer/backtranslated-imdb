WOW what can I say. I like shadow film, and I'm going out of my way to see a corny action flick, but Snake Eater, I'd rather have a nail drive into my pissing hole while my grandmother gave me a lap dance. Lorenzo Lamas, pfft more like Lorenzo Lameass this guy has as much play as Bill Clinton has self-control. It has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse. Crazed Hillbilles YEP! unnecessarily often shot (with a really strange scar) YEP! crappy soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but 1 is as low as it goes. Seriously, I think someone played a joke on me when I saw it, it can't be right ...... the worse there are 2MORE SNAKE EATER-MOVIES! ...... Guess it in demand.
