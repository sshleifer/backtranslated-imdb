I wish I could give this movie a zero or even lower because it is unfortunately what it deserves. I honestly never go out of a movie, but one was so terribly awful that I couldn't stand a moment. Please, please - thank you for humanity's sake - skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really dive into, it's not. It has incoherent, unpleasant leads, chopped structure, ridiculous dialogue, and it is totally unconvincing in every way possible. At a very basic level, it fails to entertain. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so stage, it's WORSE than any student movie I've seen. As if that wasn't enough, the whole movie depends on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over story. The scriptwriter may as well have written a novel because they insisted on telling everything, rather than showing it. We just have to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have a special connection, although there is no character development to illustrate this. Also, this movie continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a freezing frame of the characters with their names written over the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. We don't really understand any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm a gay woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema. I start to think that lesbian and gay movies are much like Christian rock - no matter how terrible it is, people will still flock to it and master it, no matter how poor the quality is. Please remember not to rent this !! Instead, we encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting "But I'm a cheerleader" or "Four" or "Heavenly Creatures", instead of swallowing, regardless of mindless tripe, seeking gay communities (ie. Queer as Folk.
