After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I was very excited about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about. 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is inexpensive excitement), the play is over the top, but the story, oh boy, what story? <br /> <History does not seem to go in the direction, first they take the alien (after 7 years!) they finally succeed, and they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why in hell did they catch it?). Then the girlfriend, who is the most senior, wants to go away from this madness, so suddenly she does not, so again she does, and then she does not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill all humanity (and remember, in all these years no other people have seen these permanently resident aliens) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a lot of foreigners into peaces. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this movie.
