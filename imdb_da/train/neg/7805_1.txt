An actor's first movie is usually something you can afford to miss - it's often the first job where the lack of movie experience of everyone involved is really exhibited and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than even in 1982 standards, it's so bad it's hysterical fun. Filtered entirely in the Chicago area on a small budget of course, most of the entire cast of stiff, wood and cartoon-like plays is a cross between a high school and a poor community theater. Noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialogue, and the dialogue is really poor, very declarative in a way that comes out as compulsory and appropriate rather than natural and organic. Scenes are constructed and choppy, and although the characters go through for a number of years, it is neither the children nor the adults at all. <br /> <br /> I think it's possible to make a Christian movie that is good for a large secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are then focused on 'The Message' or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values ​​are thrown aside. (I am sure that it is no coincidence that the protagonist has the same name as producer / director / editor - and cast member.) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and credible - to see in his subsequent film. Career as his is certainly not built on films like this.
