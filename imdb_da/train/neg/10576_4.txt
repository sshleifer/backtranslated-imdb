I was very excited when this series was premiered in 2005. The pastor was very simple and appealing: every episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a famous, remarkable horror director. Then, when I finally looked at them, it was a bit of a letdown. Some good episodes originated from the first season, but all in all, it was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in favor of a shock. In any case, you had a couple of good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat" with the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and total loss to me. The "Sounds Like" section may well be the worst I've seen on television in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope that season 3 will be about next year, but I don't hold my breath.
