This movie is shown over and over on cable lately, so .. There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either Luke Wilson or the equally daring 'villian' in this movie. The female actresses are very sweet and that is the only reason to watch this movie. I guess it's fun that Luke is just ugly / dorkier / stupid friend is around, but that's what we get. None of the women leaders could ever talk to any of the men in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get are they creeping and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys who were best described on Friday the 13th 4. Death * @ $ #
