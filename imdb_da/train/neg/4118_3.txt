During channel surfing we found this film with its promising synopsis. We were horrified by the flat play and formula story. We found entertaining the exploding car scenes, incredible shoot outs and putting it down with tyro foam and cardboard. What was even more fun was to see all the recycled scenes from "Dante's Peak", where the front of the church falls on the school bus, breaking the business fronts away from the main street, the transition collapsing and the red truck jumping down the street as brick falls on it. It was a good laugh, even though it was unintentional, leaving the viewer wondering if it wasn't originally intended as a low-budget campaign for disaster movies.
