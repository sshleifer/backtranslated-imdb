I don't really expect much of "The Night Listener", and I have never actually heard of it before I watched video streaming. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and voltage. Sometimes it pulls a little, but it actually helps keep you wondering what will happen and more importantly: when. As the movie progresses, the character that Robin Williams plays, becomes a kind of "cat and mouse" game to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence of a 14-year-old abused child which no one seemed to have ever seen personally. Night Listener is an interesting story that is great for building the excitement of the entire movie, and you are basically in the dark of who is lying and what is right. But in the end, it is disappointing and does not live up to the potential it could have had. It does not give you a detailed or plausible explanation for the other protagonist who would have been helpful and interesting.
