The above seemed to be a much more appropriate title as I and my suicide children decided to see this masterpiece of modern bullshit. <br /> <br /> Erotic, Scary, Suspenseful, Think about, it's all the things this movie fails to be. <br /> <br /> However, it is incredibly fun, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet, this film doesn't even try to be fun, and it's one of the movie's great achievements, it becomes a comedy without trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is an old guy who looks amazing Christmas man walks around plowing zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me believe in the title of the movie, if it were vampires vs zombies, why were the vampires and the zombies not fighting? Oh well regardless, there were more errors in this rental than the title. Such as this one; There has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie as creatures that go around that seem much like your average tourist. And yet there are only four zombies in the whole movie. Another problem is besides a shop everywhere is deserted. Surely you will see zombies roaming in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact, I think they just drove around in a forest circle over and over again, as they didn't have a high enough budget for movies in a wider location, it or the director wouldn't waste his precious time filming in different woods he was busy with to sit in a trailer that moved off to be bothered by such trivial conditions. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And then he told the eight members of the caste to dress up as different people and try not to act carefree while assuming he changed his name and began to randomly cut the film rolls "editing is not a hard work anyway right?" The only reason this "movie" found that way into our bag was because we somehow got it confused with Freddy vs. Jason, strangely how these things happen, it's not. And the only way we did that at night was to tie gas masks on and bolt them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nausea. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, we laughed at the end, but I'm sure you do it a lot when he has lost his beauty ................ ...
