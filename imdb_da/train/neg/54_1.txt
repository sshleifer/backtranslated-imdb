The only good thing about this movie was shot by Goldie Hawn, who stood in her little French cut bikini panties and struggled to keep a dozen other bad women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she was scourging and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins compete with Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen, and that shot almost killed me. I had forgotten all that hidden in the naughty Roladex in my mind until I see it here today on television, where they actually blurred her mid section in that scene, good grief, remind me what a smokin 'hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the 80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
