I bought this movie for 1 euro without knowing what it was all about. I thought "hmmm, a movie called mutilation man should be if not much fun at least filled with gore". It wasn't fun okay. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I don't mind disturbing movies, but one just doesn't mean anything except child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was horrible. The actor ... there was no action. Just some fcked-up fakes are mutilating themselves for over 90 minutes. This is probably important for sicko's dressing off on extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Don't look here. It's not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I never bought this. <br /> <br /> They had to mutilate the guy who did this
