A group of human aliens goes to Earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric animals instead where they all eat physcedelic fungi and act retarded. Padded with footage from "Planet of the Dinosuars" and terrible jokes this is definitely one to miss. The action is also horrible, and while this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (which movie can it be?) This is still pretty terribly contradictory. It's 90 minutes of running time feels like an eternity and you will probably curse life so do yourself a great favor and just go ahead, skip this crappy movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Try reselling this turd as a MST3K style that makes fun of the movie they made a decade before, and it works to an extent that it still isn't something that can be seen but Ariauna Albright is warm, but Lilith Stabs has a rather unattractive voice. /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> DVD Extra: Joke commentary, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minutes in the black featurette; Jessica Mills reporting; Stills gallery; and original trailer
