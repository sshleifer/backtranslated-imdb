After just seeing FIVE OVER EYES, I have to be honest ... I just didn't like it. I've read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just haven't got where those reviews have come from, <br /> <br /> I've got a lot of time for novice filmmakers and I 'I'm sure The directors will do well, but the budget they had was the biggest problem there were two cameras used throughout the movie (which was OK), but they seemed like really cheap cameras.
