I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of a movie I made online. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading interviews with the director, he says he respects constructive criticism so I will try to avoid basing the movie just for its sake and giving my opinions on why I found it so disastrously terrible. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know the budget may not have allowed for big thespians, but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years, he probably knew some players who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. The incredible lame makeup and special effects. Once again, of course, the budget disturbed the original purpose, but having worked in makeup for so many years, there is really no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarities with the Hostel. Although it is not exactly a rip off, it is trying to get into the success of the previous movie. Only problem is Roth knew where he went and exactly how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. The music. Not at all scary or scary, not even disease, just rather annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also the underplotters of the theater and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as almost as an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. How to topple and not in a good way. Nuf said. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear the instructor's thoughts on my post (he frequently avoids his pages on IMDb.) Leaves buddy ... what did you think. Surely at some point during either shooting or editing you realized what a turkey yolu had on your hands ... Sorry I will not be hard but you need more talent than this I hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is Better, hopefully coach makes progress. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, avoid this as the plague. I want my 81 min back with interest. (At least I didn't pay to see it.)
