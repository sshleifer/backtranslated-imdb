Do you want a good recipe for errors? Take a s **** y plot, add some weak, completely undeveloped characters and even throw away the worst special effects a horror movie has known. Leave the stew for a week (the amount of time spent probably doing this trash can). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places. <br /> <br /> The movie was completely blown. My words cannot convey how painful it was to see. This is not one of the bad movies that you and your friends can make fun of. This is not Plan 9 from the outer space. This is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. I suppress myself when I realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this shit if you can call it acting. But once again, when you have a bad direction, bad story writing, bad everything, plays the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a big, obnoxious turd that you long to fast out of existence, horrible that a friend or loved one might see it. I really like I could somehow destroy all copies of this movie, so it won't pollute the minds of the hopeful movie makers. Thanks, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me new found respect for every movie I've ever seen. You have shown me what is really terrible and why I should appreciate all the movies that are only crazy or boring.
