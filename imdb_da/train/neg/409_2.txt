<br /> <br /> Finally, Paul Verhoeven bombarded this one. He became a joke on himself. Once again, we have a movie that includes sex and violence, immorality, women's learning, and lots of attention-to-character dollying pans. It's all for nothing. Because theirs is no action at all in this movie. It all fudges its fixed pieces. All the actors give this kind of performance a Verhoeven movie. In other words, violently dealing at almost every level. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world that the characters inhabited. These researchers work in the same way. Sorry Paul, but soldiers and scientists aren't really made up of the same mindset. A big mistake in the plot was that after deleting one night to do evil things, Kevin Bacon's character returns to the science lab where we have already spent more than enough time to watch these animated manniques (Elizabeth Shue except) go and talk. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. How could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all ??? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. So look at what this movie does and you really did so poorly and concluded that the whole project really was. <br /> <br /> More insulting is Doco on the DVD, where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MAd Genius. Well one in two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing in it. Like the title says. <br /> <br /> They are !!!
