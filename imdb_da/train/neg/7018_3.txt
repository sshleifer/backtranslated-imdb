Totally forgettable. Especially because of the weak action. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he has been around since the late 90s. I thought he was a beginner when his acting was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I've seen her well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a weird personality. Life is not the kind of actress who will give the character a fiery, emotional personality that Diane Keaton would be able to, but it was quite strange to see her say her lines in whispering state. It seemed that there was absolutely no very good chemistry between the actors, and I also think Diane Keaton saw it. She's a great actress, but just seemed a little over the top of this movie. It felt like she just wanted this movie over as soon as possible. I wouldn't blame her.
