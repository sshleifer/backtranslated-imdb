First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? We're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> So get amateur players. It will be good for the festival's hype. After all, who needs people who have spent years to honey their craft? Then hire a filmmaker who doesn't know how to light. You see, if it is well-lit, it will not look right, and the festival's people will not like it. Who should still have professional level photography? Then hire a ten-year-old who has never had a camera to be your operator. It will give your movie the totally amateur touch that the festival's screeners will celebrate for "reality" and guarantee that even if you want to empty the seats of real people, critics and a small step from the audience who over-intellectualize, scream "genius" because they will not believe this was just completed amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you've done that, buy your ticket for the Festival of Bad Movies aka Sundance. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
