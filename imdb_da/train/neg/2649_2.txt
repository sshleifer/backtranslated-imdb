My wife and I started watching this movie with expectation. It looked hot and touching. It started well; but soon became boring and honestly idiotic after a while. It was so bad we broke it off. The movie was badly acted and honest, we couldn't really understand or would understand what exactly why or how hell they could handle with this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and worked wackos song and cleaning. I would have gotten her committed. And of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood, we have to throw it a token "gay" character! This movie was boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!
