I don't expect much when I saw this at Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. Still, I kept out hope. It sounded a bit much like "Bride and Prejudice" (L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty, parent conflict, blah blah). The B&B was not perfect but it was an enjoyable movie with some good laughs and sympathetic characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" had none. The play seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers. Characters were so the clich√© story seemed to have been written by high school freshman drama students. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed like there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue. I mean a lot. I sometimes know it's necessary, but it sounded like half the movie was shot in a closet and it became very distracting. <br /> <br /> Two stars are somewhat generous.
