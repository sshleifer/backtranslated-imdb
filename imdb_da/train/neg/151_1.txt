It is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what's the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, I'd have a proper answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's recorded at 35mm, so it's already sticky as hell. I wouldn't have bothered to comment, but I noticed some fanboys (probably associated with the movie) had claimed this was the best movie since the matrix. Let me debunk myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in the movie. Everything shouts sticky. The actor is ugly. Battle choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The battle scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl who slips her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivers weak kicks that would not hurt a kitten. Of course, the director has drawn people from the street to give them roles in the movie. <br /> <br /> I know the director didn't have much budget for the movie, but there are still better movies made on a smaller budget before. Unforgivable.
