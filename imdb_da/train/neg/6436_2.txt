I am a friendly person so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen for a long time. There was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas affected, ie. What Jesus might really want us to know was dashed, and instead we got heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). Total crucifixion for the first 15 minutes would have been more humane for both her character and the audience. The action was scarce and the direction was uninspired. And if I saw another dripping water or pigeons flying towards the camera, I might have started screaming higher than Patricia.
