No mention, if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for "The House Next Door" from her 1970s title with the same title, or someone else did it. This lifetime-like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed a cable version of what was clearly a movie for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the advertisements, which of course you can't find in this version, we saw. <br /> <br /> The movie star is Lara Flynn Boyle, who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Mrs Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character in the center of the mystery. This was not one of the actress's better moments in front of the camera. It applies to the rest of the mainly Canadian actors who deserved better. <br /> <br /> The film has a feel of a cross between "Desperate Housewives" with "The Stepford Wives" and other better known features combined with a mild dose of creepiness. The best thing about the movie was the house that serves as a setting.
