After seeing this thing, you read the summary on the back of the DVD and think back to the real movie .... I got a little dizzy. I thought maybe I fell asleep and dreamed that I was a syndrome of immersion that struck through an endless forest where people drove 11 miles an hour and no longer stopped another so occasionally tasteless lesbianism. Where (zombies?) Comes out of nothing and (vampires?) Who (seduces?) Clean heart citizens on the way to save the world. Neither the zombie nor the vampire meet each other. The only battles I remember were getting the walrus Bonny Giroux panties away. Coo Coo ca FAT! Everybody! Maybe it was because we looked at what was widespread and was too lazy to change it to its original resolution, but it actually made it more entertaining. In summary, my subsequent tea dissertation had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter and then appeared throughout this film. Bloodrayne did look like Citizen F *** ING CANAN
