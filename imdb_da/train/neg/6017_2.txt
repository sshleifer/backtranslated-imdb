The only fun thing about this very mockable movie is playing "guess" the location. Which Toronto landmark will stand for which US / international location. <br /> <br /> Who knew that the antichrist would be Russian? of course he can't be american when we need yanks to save the day - oh buck ... you tell us the truth ... you show us the light ... and the way out of the building these nasty anti-christs get theirs way. <br/> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they do not do another of this ilk! We don't have to pray.
