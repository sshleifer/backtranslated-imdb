Okay so I went into this movie, not expecting much, I expected an action girl like The Fast and the Furious. Some good cars some nice girls some of a decent plot. Unfortunately, I should say that this was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Don't make me wrong, the cars were cozy and the girls were okay, but the way they put the movie together was simply crazy to put it nicely. The story just never made you interested in the cast, and the movie just seemed to be pieced together. So in general, this movie wasn't the worst ever, but if you're looking for a movie for this weekend, I would pass it on to this moment.
