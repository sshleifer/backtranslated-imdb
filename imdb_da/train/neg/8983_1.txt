Ulises is a literature teacher who comes to a coastal city. There he will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in town. They will start a rugged romance that will end in Ulises sweet tragic death. Some years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city, and lives a quiet, happy life surrounded by money. One day, the perception of Ulises will make her passion stand up and act without thinking about the consequences. The reason is quite absurd, and none of the actors play a decent role. In addition, three quarters of the movie are sexual acts that are still well filmed, are quite tiring, as we will see more evolution of history. It's just a bad Bigas Luna movie, with lots of sex, no argument, and stupid characters everywhere.
