I guess there are some out there who remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl days at such TV shows as T.J. Hooker, Charles in Charge, and who's the boss? You confuse you! Maybe you can remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. No matter you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about male aliens. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that don't make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for peppers and cinnamon? Why didn't the foreigner eat her? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before alien eats her boyfriend and assumes her identity, you will see her in Alex Menese's body. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to see this trash can. Stay for the shower and boyfriend and continue your business.
