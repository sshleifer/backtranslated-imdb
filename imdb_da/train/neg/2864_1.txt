This movie is so bad that it just counts reality. The film is at best character school material, the play is pathetic and the director must forever be banished from film making in any form. So bad can it not even be seen as a comedy in the form of Showgirls. The only thing this DVD was going to was the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who haven't witnessed the accident is to make yourself a well-deserved favor in advance and not save your time or money on this piece of waste . If you want to watch a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many more worthy in such a world than this bin.
