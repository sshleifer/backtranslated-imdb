Yes, unfortunately I came across the DVD of this and found out that it was incredibly terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some dork in an orange hat calling itself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea that these guys could come up with a character, they should definitely not be in the movie making scene. Bad "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically there is not a "wrestler" on this whole disk with some sharpness of charisma. "Wrestling" in the Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully jumping on a trampoline. They also keep giggling together all the time to make the experience more like a toddler's playtime than a "wrestling deathmatch". Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a rather lacking backyard wrestling clone. Only instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING we get a trampoline, giggling kids, TERRIBLE sound, and a guy called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Breaking fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's terrible.
