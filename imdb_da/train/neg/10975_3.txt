This movie is blowing - let's get it right now. There are a few scene precious stones placed inside this pile of crap, but no one can redeem the warm plot. Colin Farrel is similar to Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and works in a similar way. I usually hate Colin because he's an adventure in general, but he's okay in this movie. There were two plot lines in this film - one about a child throwing stones through windshields with floating vehicles and the other about a woman with mustache. Let's see it - this movie has no freaking idea of ​​what it would say or where it would go. The letters interpret at some levels, but are in no way worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and meaningless, and then there is an occasional OK scene. But on the whole - don't disturb unless you love Irish accents so much that you can see mediocrity, and it is rescued by anyone who resembles Lucky Charms elf-an American fetish who has catapulted some really crappy movies to success.
