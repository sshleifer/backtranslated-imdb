This film is about a male escort involved in a murder investigation that took place in the circle of powerful men's wives. I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and engaging, but I was so wrong. The pacing is painful and scary slow that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing much happens. Seriously, the first hour can be condensed to ten minutes. It's so slow it is. <br /> <br /> The fact that it lacks any excitement or action scenes aggravates the boredom. It is almost shocking that even argument scenes are so common and devoid of emotion. Maybe it's because of the higher social class's stiff upper lip? <br /> <br /> It is boring that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.
