Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this and gives the viewer a long appearance of Huppert's face and it is a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - she senses emotions with the slightest lift on an eyebrow or flickering of a smile. <br /> <br /> Other than the enjoyment of seeing an experienced actor stand out in his profession, nothing in this movie makes me recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-degradation, sado-masochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" can work for you. Besides these attributes, I couldn't find any redeeming value in it.) <br /> <br /> Buried in all of this strange material there is a truth core. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, regardless - begin as strange people and be shaped into strangers by the competitive environment. Not worth a trip to a movie theater to relive this life lesson. <br /> <br />
