Wow ... I can't believe how badly ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I had heard the rumors, read the reviews - but had to think for myself. Well, let me tell you - it's blowing !!! The worst act of any movie ever made, and twice what to do while everyone involved was completely wasted, creepy and ridiculously gore FX, no distinguishing plot, "cinematography" that resembles my grandmother filmed it with his video camera, weapon props, there is no joke - made of tin foil - the list goes on and on ... Three guys are stranded on an island, where a bunch of usirdos runs around with plastic and tin foil swords. Two of the prisoners freed along with a rebel on the island's freaks and get a day's main start before being chased by the rest of the "tribe" ... it's pretty much ... <br /> <br / > Honestly - this is one of the WORST movies I've ever had the accident to submit to myself as well. The budget was about $ 200 and was spent entirely on Gore FX (which actually wasn't a bad idea ...). There is nothing to ZOMBIE DOOM other than linked ridiculous doing scenes with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialogue. This movie makes other non-budget excursions like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD resemble TITANIC. Some may place the ZD in the "so bad-it-good" category - and I think if you are really full or tall and see it with a couple of friends MST3K style - I think it could be seen that way. But not by me. I basically hated everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is as appalling and included as a "bonus" on the Shock-O-Rama release of ZD) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas' other works - then he must be banned from having something to do with making a movie ever again under the death penalty. There is an entertaining Kungfu fight in the last half of the movie and a lot of blood - so I'll give this a very generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this.
