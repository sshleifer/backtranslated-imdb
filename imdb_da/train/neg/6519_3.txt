Filmed in a documentary style, but you can tell the participants have been coached. A newly divorced wannabe movie maker (Myles Berkowitz) sees a chance to experience his love life and step into movie biz at the same time. He intends to make a documentary piece to find love by recording twenty dates, including ramifications. Comedy is at best spotty; The rest are mishaps by accident. Also participating is Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the enticing Elisabeth Wagner. Attempting credibility, downloading Tia Carrere speaks into a cameo. This will suffice as a manual on how NOT to achieve a satisfactory date.
