After searching for this movie high and low I actually found it when I at least expected to play on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day. Why I was endlessly searching for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris, who was made in the TV show's last declining year, I have no idea. The movie is simply awful. The written part dealing with a week is. Of course, the highlight of the film is the real artists who were "too hot for TV" or rejected for some reason. That part is still angry, but campy bad, which was fun in its own way. Now that I saw what I was looking for for so long, would I see it again in my life? Resoundingly NO !! Do yourself a favor and just see the much better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the current show. The girl shopping where just licking popsicles provocative was fun, but having to endure seeing Jay P. The morning blink audience probably made me sterile. Gradually, I am so glad that this was a massive flop, because if it was a massive hit, there could have been a "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and that my friends would probably have brought the apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My character: D
