Good lord, who made this turkey, must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie, he should see something else, or never seen a movie before ... 9 out of 10 stars? He says what, it's as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Unintentionally fun, massively incredible characters, absurd situations, seem to have been shot in Griffith Park (which seems pretty good - MASH was shot in Griffith Park), crappy script, almost anything that could be wrong with a movie that rolled into a package. Must be required viewing for all potential filmmakers as an example of how a movie could be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something a USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give this a passport unless you make fabrics and are in high camp.
