Such great actors are a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and horrible character, the movie is not fun at all, a subconscious message can be seen "IT IS A DAMN CRAP !!!", "IT PRESSS SO BAD !!", "BELIEVE YOUR TV AT WIND" soon. It is simply disgusting and annoying. Besides silly plot, sense of humor, there is something else. How the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. Usually I don't care about the decorations in movies, but from "Free Money" it made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a viewer gets nothing! You see it at the expense of health.
