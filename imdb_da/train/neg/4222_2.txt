For those of us who lived through the weeks of filming in the city and around the valley - so that we do not forget about the boring days of road closure and "filmmaking". As a reminder to those who live here - sites include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, the Big Basin. etc. The bank was BC lighthouse; Hunting scenes included Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was over all of us - even then. As far as the movie goes - a joke of a script and another major laugh at acting and plot - but who cares at this level. A lovely time capsule for those who enjoy our coast and valley landscape. <br /> <br /> Further notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the movie), original name of the movie was welcome to Buzzsaw - the old Erbas parking lot was the town square, the backyard shot was off of Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Turn off the thinking cap and watch a few actors in their early days.
