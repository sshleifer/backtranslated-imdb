NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. But not good. The scenes were pulled out way, way, way, way, too long. Sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long. The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been unique, but unfortunately it became so boring that I can only give it a 2 out of 10. It is far below average. <br /> <br /> Some There are also other issues in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays an entire family tree. The guy who played the grandparent does not look like him, but grandfather, father and son (who gives us constantly unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hairs and the same basic ball-haired personality. No one seems to notice that each of these children resembles a clone of the last, although images of them are beaten in each turn. One is smaller, but if the film hadn't been 3 weeks long, it wouldn't have been so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) That no news from Germany even whispered long ago if Jews are rounded and shipped is ridiculous. Some words would have got them, and the idea of ​​trying to run would probably have been discussed. Uncle in France would surely have sent a warning to get them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You use forever to tell us this thing, and the development of relationships between protagonists is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... married. So have kids. Then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget to develop relationships. This would not have been so much in a 2 hour movie again, but in time nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The finish was just bad. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but you also do not like it unless you are sadistic. The conductor / writer must be tortured by having to see this inflated waste once a week meaning the endless loop, oops, they are the same. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie, I think I think Istvan Szabo should model his instructor career after him. Long drawn film that completely destroys any substance in the film. A brief description of 'The Horse Whisperer' and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start to see while the sun is shining, it will be good after dark when you leave.
