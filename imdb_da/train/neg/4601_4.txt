I don't know anything about the author's or director's previous work, so I hadn't made any prejudices on the movie. Based on the brief description of the plot in the guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But insecurity was put on impossibility. Each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to draw on more bloodshed, cruel makeup or special effects. The result was professional, and Kari Wuhrer seems like a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. It was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go through the vagaries of the story, but I will give an example of what I think of a surplus of explicit doing. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his former victim (Wendt) out of freezing. McKenna had killed Wendt by biting a lump out of his neck. Now he feels that he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's death. (What should the police do, measure its bite radius?) McKenna unwraps Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag is in, takes an ax and begins to cut Wendt's head. Whack. Whack. Whack. Chest's ear keeps chipping away at Wendt's neck. The air is filled with nuggets with flying frozen meat, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He brushes it out when he's done.) McKenna then takes the frozen head out to a small fire he's built. He sits on the ground, squats next to it, takes some pictures of a woman he's just killed, and shows them to Wendt's head. "Remember her? We could really have done it if it hadn't been for you," he says to his head. "Duke, you've always wanted bonfire, haven't you?" he asks. Then he puts his head on the fire. We only get a glimpse of what is burning, but we can hear the fat that sits in the flame. <br /> <br /> I don't want this kind of garbage to be censored. I am only wondering who enjoys seeing these things. <br /> <br /> There is no need to continue with the rest of the movie. Now I have to mention an example of an "insecurity" since I brought up the idea. McKenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark, bare cabin. He knows he will be clobbered half to death in the following days. (He has literally encouraged the weighties to do so.) What would you do in this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does about what can turn out to be the last night of his life. He finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates (successfully). Give the man the medal of freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster similar to Pizza The Hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often handheld and wobbly. The dialogue has lines like: "Life is a piece of ***. Or it's the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view." The use is made of a wide-angle lens that makes ordinary faces gargoyle masks. A house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end, while the hero McKenna walks towards us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> He is also quite a part. He first kills a $ 13,000 man by bashing him over his head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a refrigerator over to the body. (This disturbs him a little, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment.) Then I hope I have the order right, he kills Wendt by tearing out some of the neck. Then he accidentally kills his first victim's wife and blames the weight of it, even though they almost have nothing to do with almost any moral calculation. Then he burns his head honcho (Baldwin) alive. When he had deactivated the two minor weights, he deliberately struck them up, even though one of them is not completely unsympathetic. And we must twist for McKenna. <br /> <br /> It's not cartoon deaths like those in Dirty Harry's movie - bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first - $ 13,000 murder - is made clumsy enough to look like what can happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another person, as Hitchcock had demonstrated in Torn Curtain. But that scene leads to no place of importance. <br /> <br /> Some people like this, especially those who are young enough to believe that pain and death are things that only happen in movies. Some meretricious things on the screen here.
