This sport is a fine, deep casting, but for a thriller you deliver better than name players and speak. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk. Most of it was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. <br /> <br /> The first five listed players in here are women, so it verifies that it's really a "chick flick" and a little bit different. This probably plays on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. By halfway through they had lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years in here.
