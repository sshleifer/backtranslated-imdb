I seriously think which group would sing about a crazy car? So what if their ten, it's too immature for a little child to sing about "being my women" I mean seriously! The name is also cuddly, naked brothers? just because they take their pants off ?? HOW TO CREATE.I don't get why they need a TV show, I think most artists don't need a TV show about themselves, especially the naked band. Heck how many of them are in the freaking group. And what about the movie? Jeez Nick uses to be the highlight of my years growing up but seriously The naked brother band? So many parents would not let their children see this especially by the name of Naked Brother's band, it is a stupid, uncreative show that should not be broadcast on television.
