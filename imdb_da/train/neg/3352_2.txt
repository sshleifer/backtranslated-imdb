I don't even know where to start this one. "It's about the family." It must be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, though it couldn't be a horror movie even though it was trying !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He has to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." He has some talent. Lily Taylor should also stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no room for legitimate trades for her. I am serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, ever.
