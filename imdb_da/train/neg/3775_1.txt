As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are cartoon bold. I think the director has carried his "artistic vision" away from the film's appearance instead of much need for attention to the content. In spite of its cast, the notions of the story and the story are almost incoherent. Madonna was probably throwing clean as a stunt to get the pre-release press. A good thing like her appearance lent her something on her album "I'm Breathless", which was a stratospheric hit (largely due to the inclusion of dance-hit "Vogue" - which is not in and does not have the slightest relation to this movie.) I would guess that the big part of the money from this movie came from ties to Madonna's album "I'm Breathless". <br /> <br / > If you see it at home, at the end titles, you will think, "There are two hours out of my life, I want to get back." Save yourself the wasted time - don't bother with this.
