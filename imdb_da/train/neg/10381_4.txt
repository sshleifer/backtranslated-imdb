Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200-year-old house in Japan, where a violent murder suicide threesome occurred. <br /> <br /> New approach is about the only element of interest in this very slowly moving horror flick of the Motel Hell director. The movie generates zero voltage and is composed of some chopped scenes that rarely appear to be leading anywhere anywhere. <br /> <br /> A clear example is a fairly early stage where the male leader visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had previously warned. The monk tells the story of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts off to something else. Previously, the monk had offered to help. Well, where's the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse, and the monk is not mentioned until the very end when he comes up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier - try driving out alcohol of the house, although at present it is difficult for viewers to break. There are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs that watching the American actors eventually become obsessed with Japanese spirits and suddenly begin to do bad martial arts, I say enough, because the scene is more or less reminiscent of the chainsaw duel of the same director Motel Hell, more obviously had to be entertaining, but it is generally a forgettable dud.
