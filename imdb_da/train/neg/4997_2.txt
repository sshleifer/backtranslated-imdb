... but it's certainly not without profit. Already author-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual biographical effects by telling his stories, broadly drawing yet distinctive characters and situations and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly clever and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder Coen brothers next movie will be a tribute to Sturges.) The big problem is that the plot is not quite there yet; It lacks surprise, the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. The coffee slogan is a miserable thing to hang on to, and the end is thoroughly predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing much better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, first see "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "Miracle of Morgan's Creek". If you've already seen these, go ahead and see it here.
