The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff. I've only seen maybe eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The very best thing about it is that it is short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly robes (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's films are not. Kay Francis's whole looks to be bold and far less attractive than she usually does. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know otherwise, is good as a semi-hard "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother?) I struck out?) Going up a dirt road to a prison painted in foggy outlines at a sound stage is more than ridiculous . The whole movie is so inexpensive, so unreliable and so careless that it feels infected with an acidic cynicism by anyone who has done it: Warner Bros throws garbage into pieces that do not know in Warner Bros' cynical estimation of them that they get garbage.
