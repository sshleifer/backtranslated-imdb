From just watching the trailer to Theodore Rex, you'd think this is a bad buddy combination with Whoopi Goldberg and a dinosaur guy. It's true, but this is mostly a futuristic story that resembles Batman Forever with its style and strange character design. It was mismarketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, rather than just a lame cop comedy. Whether this movie is misplaced, it is still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology, and they talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he gets the case to work on, but he must be partner with Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is up to this inappropriate duo to solve the murder and it is up to the audience to stay awake long enough to do so through this piece of crud. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the picture as a normal-acting character, but at the end he is unbearable to listen to. For some reason, along with being a detective, he is also a poor comedian and a poor imitator. He makes imitations of famous people and accents, and has some really horrible lines. Whoopi blames him for farting, and he says, "It's not my asshole!" Wow! Which puerile, immature line, even for a child's film of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I hoped Teddy would bite her head out of the entire length of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what it would be. When the futuristic scenes and actions occur, there is no comedy or humor. In some non-action scenes, the characters try to be as fun as they can, which just results in the unstoppable opposite boredome. The action scenes do not work as they are too strange and not violent enough, and as mentioned earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here. <br /> <br /> Having a dinosaur / human detective duo works like a beautiful original movie, if nothing else. Nix! This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Only replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set it in the future, and that's the same plot. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and detective solves the murder, a tone and detective solves the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and Wizards. The bad ones here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys that seem like beasts. The club scene in Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit goes down on stage, imitates dinosaurs. This is a huge rip-off of a much better movie! All in all, this is a bad movie, not even deserving it just for VHS stature. My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG for mild violence, language and raw humor.
