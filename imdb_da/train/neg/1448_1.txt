After growing up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley, I can tell you that this movie is nauseous. The majority of Texans do not live as this movie indicates. The reason is weak and the fake accents are entertaining, and it strengthens the stereotypical image that all Texans drink beer, honky tonkin, rednecks. The horrible fake Texas accents are what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas Twang for most Texan accents, but these people exaggerate it. You can't get anyone from New Jersey and Ohio to make Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to the disco-dancing or the 50's. Debra Winger was more convincing as a Wonder Girl than she is like a Texan.
