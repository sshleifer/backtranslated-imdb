Another Friday the 13th ripoff, even with some of its music! A group of young adults come together to a small high school reunion and begin to be slaughtered a la Jason Voorhees. Could it be the geek they used to bother in school? <br /> <br /> Routine slash feast is fun for fans of the genre and includes the usual movie T&A quota if it's ilk. The end is a little more imaginative than your standard slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: rated for violence / language, language, sexuality, nudity and some substance content.
