Yes, talk about bad followers. Rick Morani's stars in this horrible third sequel to the once fun and entertaining "Honey In Shrunk the Kids". The concept basically plays the same way as the first movie, but with the adults rather than the children shrinking and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. If you think it sounds interesting, think again. The movie is boring at best, right down in an embarrassment at worst. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the continuity of the series has been completely washed down the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis. The actor who plays his wife has changed, the actors who play the kids have changed, those who play the neighbors have changed ... you are called. They are trying to make us think this is the same family, but the results are scary. <br /> <br /> Second, the story is a rehash of the first, with no originality. All the few jokes (and there are hardly any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are copied from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, the special effects. I'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, far worse than those shown in the rest of the series. You have to admire in awe these little characters exploring the vast home, but you will end up cringing most of it. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem of locating the action inside the house is just boring. Few things happen, and when they happen, they are not exciting at all. The first movie was entertaining because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the faults that live in it. In this are the adults (who come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) dealing with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the idea of ​​releasing such a trite successor to the already moribund series appealed to Disney's leaders, except perhaps because they were spending money without spending five minutes thinking about something new . I warn you: Leave this tasteless shopping waste where it must remain: getting dust on the store shelves.
