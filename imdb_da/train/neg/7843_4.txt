This is a weak sequel: It lacks interest and easy touch of the magnificent "Man Called Horse" in almost every aspect, and when compared to each other, they hardly seem to be the same genre. is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke various Indian ceremonies, but comes across as trying too hard to bottle the first magic. In this film, the tribe has been lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has hit paradise, and they are living in fierce misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: The first movie took us to a place where we wanted to be, a simpler time. This brings us to ruined Indians in a miserable world, and the white man is the hero and savior, who rather rejects the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first is that the white man learned and discovered that real civilization lies in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second movie, all this is missing, and then we end up with a weak film. A big disappointment.
