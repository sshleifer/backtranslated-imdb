I thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there is this one song at the end which is just a guy shouting out "Yaowwww!" while some curls randomly on a wooden object. That said, there are some beautiful songs, but it's not worth watching hte movies over. Go on itunes (they have the album), preview it and choose the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy making tea. Well, that's a little exaggeration. But you will see what I mean if you see it. That said: DO NOT SEE!
