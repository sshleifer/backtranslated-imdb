Of course, "Flatley" is not already the perfect name for a dancer, but I think Michael really pushes the irony envelope with this new title: "Flames Feet" <br /> <br /> You really can't resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray for the retiring (and clear, weak) Flatley. <br /> <br /> I might add, much like the merry London crowd (per review below), I am also thrilled to be his last live performance. <br /> <br /> "Hinting that it could be his last live performance, Flatley is cheering for an enthusiastic London crowd." ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide
