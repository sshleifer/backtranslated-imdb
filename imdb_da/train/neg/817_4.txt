"You're not going to shoot the little creatures. At first they haven't hurt you. Second, they can be radioactive." Oh, the joy of no budget 50s sci-fi ?? Despite the odd gem like that, Superman and Mole-Men are quite uninspiring, even though they have a lean 58 minute run. It's amazingly cheap (one shot of Superman flies is an incredibly inept few animation frames) and pretty boring with it, even though it has a surprising altruistic message ?? the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats similar to Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than underground critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling, are not malicious, only misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel attempts to prevent the local small town mob headed by Jeff Corey from killing them. An interesting counterweight to today's paranoia, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
