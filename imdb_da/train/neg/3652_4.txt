I've seen this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected, but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I would say that my first reason to watch this movie was Claire Forlani. While I'm fun to watch, I feel she doesn't live up to my expectations, which I have found from her other films so far. In fact, I was just as happy to see that Arkin was a humorous achievement. The two other actors I wasn't very familiar with, so I can't compare their performance, but they were also entertaining too. The action is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some could say a little convincing, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this movie. If you enjoy any of these actors to a reasonable degree, then I recommend this movie, but otherwise leave it alone.
