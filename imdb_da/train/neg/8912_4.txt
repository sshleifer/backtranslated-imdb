Dark Rising is your typical bad, of course, quickly produced horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It has a strange inexplicable plot with holes so large that you could fit an elephant through them. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on, but it was nothing, it was a simple demon hunter who returned from the hell dimension to save campers' history of confusing things added about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and signs that do not make sense or disappear without reason. The action is bad, but honestly there is not much they can do with this script I guess. There are a couple of topless scenes, which is probably the only reason why this bad movie was made (like so many other bad movies). Give this a passport unless there is nothing else on T.V.
