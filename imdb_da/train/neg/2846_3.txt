What a horrible movie this is. The only reason you want to sit through this mess is pleasing sight of Miss Eleniak. The painful overactivation of Mr McNamara, who became embarrassing at times, destroyed what might have been a fair movie if the right actors had been thrown. Sir. McNamara is no Tom Cruise, the actor he will of course be.
