In the first, it was primarily large rats, but there were also some wasps and a huge chicken. However, this one is only giant rats period, well giant rats and a really growing little boy. This one is about this growing boy and a scientist trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats ... you know what it is. This movie has some kills and its moments, but I find it to be on par with the original, I just prefer some variation in my gigantic creature movies. Well, that's not true ... I actually like "the ants' empire", maybe I don't care about giant rodents. All in all, a pretty boring movie, though it has a rather strange event in this one dream sequence that is really bizarre. I just can't recommend this one.
