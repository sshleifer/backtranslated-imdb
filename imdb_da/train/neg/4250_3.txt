It's like what other Dracula movies always do, Dracula's minions always on Dracula's side, which is what disappointed me at the end. Whether the person wants to become a vampire or not, I would like to see something like the first movie that the minion fights against his master. It's very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just the pastor or D. wins the game (we need some surprising plots!).
