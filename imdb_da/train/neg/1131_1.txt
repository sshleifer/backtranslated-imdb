A shame that even a talented instructor, Desplechin, could not muster a decent performance out of a gloomy talented actress, Phoenix, lacks the Esther Kahn fabric to convey a very concise and clear plot. In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's situation, the notion and presentation is constructed and poorly executed to attract the compassion of the viewer. In too long a term, the redundancy of Esther's melodramatic struggle is effective and reduces the history of a fragile frame of a catastrophic display. The content is incoherent and free as Phoenix struggles to execute Desplechin's instruction, just as Esther allegedly tries to do the same. Never a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel a victory in Phoenix's talent.
