The story starts slowly and nothing fun happens for a while. All actions are in the end, but you don't have to laugh because the movie is fun, but because the story is pathetic. The funniest part is when Harvey 'I'm not Paranoia' Keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this guy!
