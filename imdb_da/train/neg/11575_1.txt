I have been familiar with the amazing book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for ages, and it was only recently when I had the chance to see this adaptation of it. I have heard many positive comments on this, so I had great hopes. When this movie was finished, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an extremely poor fit, and virtually 4.5 / 10 of the book was missing. In particular, I found that many characters and some amazing scenes in the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue. It was premature and too fast, but I was mostly sorry about the fact that you never saw the bond and the love between William Beech and Tom in this movie, which was a true downfall. Castings were also not so good. I thought it could have been really good, but it was so different from the book! Anextremely bad adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. This deserves a decent remake that could be better 1000 times better than this pile of waste.
