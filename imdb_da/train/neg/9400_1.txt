It is very unfortunate when a movie like this is made. A lot of work and money has been put into a movie that is at best amateur. The editing draws on there are obvious flaws that could have been easily fixed in another tag, and the soundtrack is imaginative. So much more could have been done with this video movie. I think they ran out of time or video tape. Handheld shots have a distinct amateur feel to them.
