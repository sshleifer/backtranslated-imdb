. . . And that is a bad thing, because at least if this had been a Troma movie, it would have had malicious violence and a greater sense of anarchic task that might have brought my rating up a bit. <br /> <br /> So what We have instead a very tame (nominal PG), almost lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown instructor who has since been unknown) Gremlins (1984) / Critters ( 1986) -Wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor, little of the logic that made Gremlin's work so good - fantasy logic or not, no excitement, no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity to make up for it. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure some of the problems with the movie are inherent in the script - let's see, no one could deliver these jokes so they would be funny - it seems the biggest fault is to fall into the director's lap, Bettina Hirsch. In more skilled hands, Munchies could have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> After all, it starts out like many amazing adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru on an archaeological dig. Simon is a bit of a wacky archeologist who is always fluid theories about the links between ancient sites and foreign civilizations. For example, he believes he sees signs of laser cutting on old stoneworks. So they are at Machu Picchu looking for more signs of Simon's theories when they happen on a secret chamber. Inside, they quickly find the animal that they later dub "Arnold", one of the titular munchies. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold home to their little California desert town. Simon, who believes that Arnold is likely to be a foreign creature, should go to a colleague's lecture, and he plans to tell his colleague that he finally has a foreign test. Paul and his extremely sweet girlfriend Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde) are facing Arnold, but since they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended while jumping into the bag. <Br /> <br /> At the same time, Simon's brother Cecil (also played by Korman in a dual role) is the owner of a successful snack food company, eager to buy Simon's home and country - they are next to their own. Simon won't sell, so Cecil hits a scheme to steal Arnold. Things are gradually spiraling out of control, and the munchies, who have a medieval streak to follow with their demands for junk food, begin to overrun the city. <br /> <br /> It sounds better in a summary than it plays on the screen. The best pictures in the movie are those with natural landscapes in the background, as when driving on the edge of the desert town. Interiors, with the exception of Cecil's home, tend to resemble poorly decorated, cheap sets, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very capable of blocking and shooting shots. It is strange that Cecil's home is a little gem, as it is in a blown-out 1980s style, down to the smallest details, and Cecil's dude, Dude (Jon Stafford), was an entertaining counterpart. So bad that he's out of the movie so fast. <br /> <br /> In any case, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes across much better here as Simon than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up being absent for most of the movie. Cecil, physically differentiated by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the "evil capitalist" in the movie, he is one of Corman's classic outrageous bourgeois characters - one of his specialties often capitalized on "Carol Burnett Show" (1967) sketches. Unlike "The Carol Burnett Show", which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the sketches straight on the edge of the chaos, Hirsch Korman raises too far and Cecil character just does it Don't work as it should. <br /> <br /> There are many other director-related issues, not least where frugal pacing and editing are taking place, completely dropping any potential thrill or convincing dramatic impact from the movie. Even scenes that should have been shoe-ins to reinforce the drama - as when munchies harass an old lady on the road - are all too awkward to have great influence. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical issues with the story as it stands. Where did munchie come from the chamber of Machu Picchu? The movie trailer seems to show an answer to this, but it was edited out of the last cut. A more serious problem is that unlike gremliner, there is no clear reason why munchies go from sweet, cozy puffins to threatening monsters. It just happens. Further, because Munchies were held PG and the violence stays down when creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatening. They are also easily shipped, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the film's core is not excitement, horror, convincing drama or any of the other things, but humor. It is more definitely like a spear of Gremlins and the countless rip-offs in the wake. The only problem with that is that the movie just isn't fun, even though I laughed a few times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are gentle clich√©s. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequitures. Due to poor timing from Hirsch, everything just falls flat. There was the potential to make a movie that was fun, fun and frightening, fun and disturbing, cheesy and exciting, all at the same time, ala Killer Klowns from outer space (1988). So bad that Munchies don't come near it.
