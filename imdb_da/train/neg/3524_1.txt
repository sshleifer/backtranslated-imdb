This is one of the worse cases of movie drives I've seen for a long time. It's so terrible that I'm not sure where to start or even worth it. The reason is the real problem, and I'm sorry 'Sly' when he puts a decent performance on his side. But that plot ... Oh dear, dear. I especially love the road at the end, which he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top while the helicopter is on its way. A day or two climbing takes him every five minutes! I could go on, but it's not worth it. Except for the ugly opening (which even a five year old could predict the outcome of), the rest is a drop. Sorry people, but it is just as bad as film making.
