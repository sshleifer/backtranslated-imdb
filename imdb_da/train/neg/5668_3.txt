First, there is absolutely no flirting in this movie - with Anthony or anyone else. These people don't flirt - they just do it. Your first test of stamina is to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. This would not be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without context, it is repulsive. So you do it through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna, and the film turns into something completely different - no better - just different: a road picture without heart. There are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos - broadly written and widely played by broad like Judy Tenuta and Mink Chairs (and a couple of hookers and drag queens too). They all deserve better. The photograph is deliberately disorienting, so if you get motion sickness (or really any kind of illness) - this flick is not for you. Come to think of it, I'm not sure who this flick is for - except maybe gay and bisexual S&M fans who like badly scripted, badly shot indy movies about themselves.
