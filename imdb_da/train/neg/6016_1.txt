This movie, which was released directly on video, should carry a warning sign that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom. It is yet another thinly blurred, evangelizing "rapture" religious film with the good guys (the believers) disappeared suddenly and the evil believers (survivors) left behind. It's an interesting concept, especially as we see it happening on a flying captain of a non-believer who has a sinful affair with a flight attendant on board (needless to say, the culprit doesn't disappear either!). Unfortunate, since all pilots were non-believers, the plane did not fly, or the movie would have been mercifully over. Although this could have been interesting without the heavy religious browbeating, as a whole plodding movies make a gag, the play is horrible and the obviously computer-generated simulations are very fake look. Plus, it is another film shoot in Canada claiming to be New York City. Save me ... I'll just read the Bible.
