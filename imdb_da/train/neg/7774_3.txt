For a good half hour or so, I remember thinking, "Hi, it may well be Bill Rebane's best performance ever!" The opening sequences are atmospheric, there are immediately some scary moments to enjoy, and our instructor even refers to his own infamous stink "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way. The concept is shamelessly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill" with three old and extremely millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in an elimination game. Of course, the participants begin to disappear quickly and one by one, and it takes the remaining greedy bones too much time before they realize that the old people are sadists ... or there is another killer among them. The movie begins and ends with a strange narrator who tells many pointless things that are not relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there are some good T&A to admire in the first ten minutes and the stupid bimbo (Shelly, I think She's called) is really fun to observe. After the first half hour, of course, the inevitable happens, and "The Cold" becomes a textbook Rebane production with retarded plot twists, the stupid dialogues ever and a total lack of excitement. There was no budget for bloody murder sequences, but our multi-talented instructor (?) Is trying to compensate for this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climaxes, and none of them is a little bit satisfactory. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: King's return? Avoid this movie you want to live longer and happier.
