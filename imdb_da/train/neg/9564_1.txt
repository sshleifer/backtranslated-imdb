Some people seem to think it was the worst movie they have ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I've really seen worse. <br /> <br /> It is said that the movies I remember (ie those I have not blocked) that were worse than this were so bad that they physically hurt any meaning involved in to watch the movie. The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that cause you to shed your eyes or pierce sharp objects in your ears to stay away from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the horror. <Br /> <br /> War Games: The dead code is not that bad, but it gets pretty close. Yes I was a fan of the original, but no I didn't expect miracles from this. Let's see it, the original wasn't really that big of a movie at first, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek appeals to it. That was all I hoped for for something bad, but it could have hit me at my nerd string. Was it too much to ask for? Isn't it really possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a straight to video release? It was obvious that it was too much to ask for. Stay away from this movie. In the beginning, it's just bad, like "Oh yes, it's bad, but it's good to enjoy it, maybe the ending will be good as in the original." And then it just gets worse and worse, and finally trust me you will wish you hadn't seen this movie.
