I saw this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painfully. I urge anyone to see this just to see how scary a movie can be, it was certainly conscious. I cringed by any inappropriate attempt at humor done in such a childish, untouched, poorly executed manner that it was without faith. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, I think exaggerate? Now give it time and think again. Terrible, totally horrible. If this wasn't a prank, the instructor and everyone else responsible for this should be removed and immediately shot after being forced to watch this movie again.
