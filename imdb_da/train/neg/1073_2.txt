I can't believe so much talent can be wasted in a movie! Gingerbread Man starts on the right foot and manages to build up great expectations for the end. But at some point, the movie becomes one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time on. It's just so amazing how the enchanted Mallory Doss manages to drag Kenneth Branagh's character around his nose. The film climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer that has been left out in the sun for too long. Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham movie ever, and it doesn't change the fact that talented stars are massaging the movie. Don't waste your time here!
