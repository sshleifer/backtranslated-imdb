I found this movie to be quite strange. From the very best time I found it extremely difficult to like this movie, and now after a bit of thinking about it I can pretty much find the reason for it. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to the bite (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here and although I can't count on my life that would be Better, I'm sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and do this movie work. Everything else is fine, except for staff at weak comedy (A Meet the Parents Joke is not really necessary, filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as the British major. It just suffers from one thing. Jean-Marc.
