You've never seen either movies and still know The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How was it done" because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a movie, they will do it. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, "Why, oh, why did Steve Martin do that?" I think he needed the money to fight an unpleasant trial and was determined that it didn't cost him anything. He knew that the successor should be so scary that he would not count it as royalties as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel could not be embarrassed is to have Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the country's favorite poor, black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just translucent obvious that you were working on this movie in a bit of sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your engagement is to be the sequel's lonely cheerleader as an IMDb user comment. I asked for you to jump into satire, but unfortunately you really made a spin in the spin. Why not 10 stars?
