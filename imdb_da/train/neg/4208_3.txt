There is a really good film lurk just below the surface of the layer on layers of cheese that is "Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I found out when I saw this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time I found that the special effects are pretty good. The reason is just "The Neverending Story" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really amazing eye-candy. The animation is amazing, and I especially liked how the animators let their characters look and work a little more surreal than the norm. I give it a character of three that I * would have given it two (for parody value only) if I had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to surely blow my mind historical history.
