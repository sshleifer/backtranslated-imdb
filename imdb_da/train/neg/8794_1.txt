I am completely confused as to why this film even looked like, let alone held so much, especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite sensible. <br /> <br /> There is a keyword describing this movie to its core - annoying. <br /> <br /> The most easily explained example of this is the use of the instructor - or more precisely, abuse - of music. In the first half, a really boring reggae melody is played in three times (once too often). But in the second half, The Mommas and The Papas "California Dreamin" "are played at least seven times, usually in top volume. Goodies, whether you liked the song or not in advance, would be thoroughly sick of it at the end. Just think, some People claim to have watched this movie four or five times, which means they have listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... All of this unnecessary hyper-repetition (it does not contribute to the story) could possibly be apologized if the rest of The movie had some lingering profits, or if the story was in any way involved. <br /> <br /> But that's not. <br /> <br /> The only aspect I found sympathetic to was Bridgette Lins charging and Still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunglasses, even though it went off pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the movie's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it. br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you have never seen a HK movie before, do not start with this. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to see it, avoid seeing it at a cinema at all costs. The forward and deactivated buttons are important survival tools here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
