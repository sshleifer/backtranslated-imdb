What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers in our time? Well, he did the typical typical summer feeding that could have been directed by someone available out of the film school ... and in fact they would have done a better job. At least they would have put half the thought in the horrible script. Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through a kind of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by monkeys. (gasp!) Except this time, the monkeys jump through groan-worthy dialogue, obscene plotting and flashy special effects that constantly reinforce in my heart that this money could have been set to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece "Aside from this tripe. As much as I enjoy the amazing acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil monkey leader Thade is no more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Fortunately, makeup allows him as actress to maintain a dignity, and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles. And unfortunately, the ever-reliable Hollywood tradition is taking the cock and the woman leading and joining them in the end without any relationship development or cause. , we're so clever, aren't we? "way Hollywood blends references from the original POTA to this. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night and r ing some friends and renting Ed Ed Scissorhands, Batman or to a lesser extent Sleepy Hollow, and recalling the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not shame and ridicule.
