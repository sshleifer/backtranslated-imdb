The movie had a cute opening, I really thought I was part of one of the best romantic comedies I've seen for a while ... there was something "strange" about the way the movie was created, realistically, but somewhat abstract and mysterious. But then history began to become more and more unrealistic. To say that the end was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would almost be an understatement ... The most typical romantic end where everything goes well with any "sympathetic" character. A scene where the protagonist realizes that he has made a mistake and chases the "dream woman" only to recognize his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of lookers. Come on. In the end, the 'good guys', 'evil guys' ... win the picture. A waste of a potentially interesting movie.
