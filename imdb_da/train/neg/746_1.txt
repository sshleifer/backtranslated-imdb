Save $ 8.97 to spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and watch the real movie by Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker and I was an avid fan of HG Wells, I had to buy this hope to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn't see more than 10 minutes at a time. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where the hell did it go? Did he use most to buy a new house? Funding his pension? Or what? Let me start with what is really good about this movie. It is true for the book, and there are a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors, who of course tried to make this a good movie. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by terrible ... and I mean terrible special effects. Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job at CGI. For me, it looked mostly like "stop action" shortcuts used instead of sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 million project needed. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur mail production that was used on this movie. My own partner and I sat down and rebuilt our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and within a day had a five-minute scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created . I've seen movies with budgets of less than $ 2 million look better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and superior to Hines' special effects in this movie. In fact, I have a much better understanding of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse for today's technology, so a movie may look like a 50's B-Movie unless it was intended, which should not have been with this particular project. One problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the movie was shaken, another demonstration of amateur movie production. All in all, I have to say that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that has better movies and special effects than this movie. /> <br /> I strongly urge anyone who appreciates good filmmaking or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this movie on the shelf and see Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
