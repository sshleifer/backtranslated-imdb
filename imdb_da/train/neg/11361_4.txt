It's pretty surreal what these flies can do ... uh well ... this is a comic, so everything can happen in it. First I have to tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is just a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the tag line. This suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I didn't see anything, at least nothing special I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) "Flies" in this movie look nothing like real flies. At least they could make them black. But cyan flies seriously? With huge heads and slim torso? <br /> <br /> 3) History. I think it was written for 6 year old children. I could tell it in two sentences, it's so simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example, "They're still American files!" Oh, give me a break.
