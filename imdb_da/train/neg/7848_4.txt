this movie was just plain stupid i dont think it was scary, i was hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just because fake and thrown blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously homosexual it also looked sucked because the play was simply horrible, you think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and paralyzed they acted even if they were in the military i came to watch movies for free and see many people go out im guessing because it was so stupidly happy i didn't have to pay for the card DUMB ASS MOVIE can't see it ... but then again that's my opinion
