This was allocated to the fans as the "winner takes everything" match took place between two separate "companies" (World Wrestling Federation and "Alliance": a merger of former WCW and ECW superstars. Because the final battle for the dudude the superior company was a tag-hold fight, wrestlers were limited to throwing opponents from each side of the ring to another, each wrestler concludes that to debacle their opponents and intensify the fight is interference necessary. Performing a special feature and tags in a partner The story had previously been hardened by Vince's underline that a member of Allance would be staggering and joining the WWF. poor performance, which is not the scarcity of scarcity, because the match format is tag team, the remaining matches are just disgusting: <br /> <br /> Edge versus T est: potent "big boot" of the test, but this did not show the true talents of the two numbers <br /> <br /> Al Snow versus Christian: good fight but redundant for pay-per-view <br /> Taji versus William Regal: the worst Battle of the Night <br /> <br /> Immunity Battle Royal: This was an outstanding fun battle to see, but because the two major corporations starred in the main event, only a wrestler characteristically featured on "Heat" and is probably and WCW light heavyweight reject (ie. hurricane, only hired as an entertainer) Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz: The Best Match of the Night: Jeff Hardy performed a "Swanton Bomb" from the top of a cage and through a wooden table and Matt was squeezed into the cage, which seemed to be extremely painful.

Shane McMahon will return to television somehow and everyone wanted to witness the death and death of the "Alliance" to see Stone Cold out of work. WWF has done much better. A fight where all tiles were brought to a faction would have been better, and what ever happened to Casket and Iron Man matches?
