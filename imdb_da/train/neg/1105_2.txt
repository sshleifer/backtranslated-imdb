Oh my. How can they make movies of such beauty, but it's so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does nothing like this. There is not even a hint of a decent story, multi-layered sign or attraction. It's just a random sequence of pointless talking together to make a 'movie'. I assume that only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it, as the world is so completely dimensional and history is so incoherent that all the elderly would be annoyed by it. But then again, it's all too scary for anyone under the age of 6 that there is probably no one who should see this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay far away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better story, and although she is probably not able to draw pictures so beautifully, her stories are much more worth listening to. And please, in the name of who you believe, do not expose your children to this piece ****. I give it 2 out of 10, and it's only for the graphics because the story and character development is so horrible that they would deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to see it anyway ... remember I warned you.
