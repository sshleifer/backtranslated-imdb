I liked "Prophecy" from 1995 very much. As always, Christopher Walken was great, and even though the film was not flawless, it was an eerie and very original Horror / Fantasy movie that entertained immensely. This subordinate 1998 sequel is still worth seeing, but primarily because of Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and again he is unique in the role of the fallen archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the deciding factor for the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, "Prophecy II" unfortunately also contains a lot of terribly annoying signs. Valerie's character was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the row, however, was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicide girl who would not quit. Still, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the movie. The whole film is rather dull and well shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene at the beginning is also quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the "Prophecy" films. "Prophecy II" is nevertheless the weakest of the three prophetic films with Walken. Absolutely a Christopher Walken one-man show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.
