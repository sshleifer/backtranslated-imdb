First of all, I must say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class and it was great. We also decided to watch movies would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing for me. The film cuts out some characters and lacks many of the main points of the book. It jumps around a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If anyone saw this movie without first reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie for me was the end. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the film they changed it! It would be the pigs and the men in an alliance and kind of "melting" together, but instead the movie made it as if the animals were to rebel against the pigs. In summary, I do not think this film captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
