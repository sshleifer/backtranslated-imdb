Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other people in the world did not have animals to tame, but Europeans did, and it stands out why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But in the third episode, he says that when the Europeans in South Africa came too far north, they ran into Zulu people and other tribes that * hired cattle and planted crops *. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic performance if they had the most important things that the author's requirements are necessary for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims bacteria in the form of cups (brought to North America by black slaves) was our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single accident *, then I think you must conclude that bacteria are irrelevant. With or without bacteria we would succeed. <br /> <br /> He says malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further north and killing thousands of Europeans while not affecting Africans. (I want to know real numbers, but he doesn't say.) So at the end he says today Malaria kills thousands of Africans, and therefore they can't get into us. So what's that, Jared? Has malaria helped Africans stop or hurt Eurpeans? And how did Europe get in order despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the causes of Europeans succeeded because of stupid luck. At times, when evidence threatens to be overwhelmed by his dishonest theories, he is reluctant to admit that perhaps Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It is sad to see this obvious neo-Marxist contortion in trying to prove its point.
