Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who * is * Ramtha is: "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old spirit warrior who appeared in JZ Knights Tacoma, Washington's Washington in 1977. Knight claims she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright of Ramtha and holds sessions where she pretends to trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice, she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars as performing as Ramtha at seminars ($ 1,000 a crack) and on her Ramtha School of Enlightenment and from the sale of tapes, books and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people will obey his command to spend hours of blindfolding in a cold, muddy, doorless maze. "John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes on this movie. He has in recent times criticized parapsychologists for their abuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This movie does the same as they fool. <br /> <br /> There is a good review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend to anyone who is considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to the coffins of the cult. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed a reviewer here on IMDb saying to take this movie with a grain of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage bin of this movie.
