This movie reminds me of a lot of anti-narcotic films from the 50s and 60s due to the fact that it was made by people who, of course, have never experienced the social evil they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his friends are "role-playing", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away in a bad assembly, showing that Hanks falls to the lady of the group. quite fun but wrong. I wonder how many poor children had their D&D things destroyed, and were told that using their imagination was the way to destruction. As a movie, it's basically a post-school special, bad play (though Hanks shows some of his talent) and debates, and no one seems to have fun. It seems that these films have a psychological focus on young people starting on the path to adultism, which is more serious and apparently requires you to span and do what everyone else does. Despite my vote of 2 it is worth seeing because of its unique genre, scaring movies that I personally find very fun.
