I don't want to go on rant here, but ..... it's the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than the Avengers. Uncompetitive management, misunderstood writing and terrible behavior are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project but without feelings. The lighting often resembles a single Sun-Gun. The sound is a little better than a single microphone on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The ground heads in strange directions without foundation or later resolution, the techie elements are patented absurd, and editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be fun. It's just bad. BTW, the packaging is intentionally misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
