The cast of this movie contains some of New Zealand's best actors, many of whom I have seen in amazing roles, however, fill this film deeply to be from the same country as them. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review, which is quite noticeable, the luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry, decorated with a pair of multicolored flags, stolen from a used car space. Most of the casting seems to be from the (large) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreamed of on a Shortland Street throwing Christmas party, the result of too many gins and possibly some salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" meets "The Love Boat" organized by your local primary school and led by an autistic and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend watching this movie as a study of how to destroy your caregiver.
