I watched the movie tonight at a free preview screen, and despite not paying a penny to watch this movie, I still felt ripped off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and if you see this movie, you leave a Benjamin in your place. The action is at best torpid; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst imitation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he was making a bad choice, leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones in the time it took to shoot that turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-unit; she looks like she is reading her lines of a teleprompter. And if you can't see the "pier" within the first 20 minutes, you landed right on this planet from a world without television and recycled products. If you really want to see a good secret service trill, hire the fire. If you look and buy into this, you will start to fear the president's security because the secret service looks and works like the adult versions of the 90210. Whatever your feelings about W, let's hope this "art" doesn't mimic life.
