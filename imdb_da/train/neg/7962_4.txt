Sequels have a grim habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give this is that it maintains the old tradition. These three stories are not as good as any of the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> The best of the trio is by far the hustle and bustle that comes to life to avenge those who killed its owners. The second story is about a seamstress that doesn't seem more than a lot of floating slop, so you wonder how someone might be afraid of it. The third story contains a como from Stephen King as a truck driver, but apart from it is a rather outrageous tale of the victim of a traffic accident coming back from the dead for the person knocking him down. <br /> See the original Creepshow instead, or if you've already done so, be happy with it.
