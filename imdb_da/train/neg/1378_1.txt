It's as if a poor 80's television series was loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh, my god was bad. The drawings of each character had little relevance. The plot itself was nothing to talk about. Something about a stalker, I guess. Finally he shoots himself? It's not quite clear, but somehow a volleyball game is involved. And the protagonist (Randy) sleeps a lot around. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it and they ended up speeding up the scenes with him in what could hardly be seen on it. Thank God, I didn't spend money on it, but I want the hour of my life back.
