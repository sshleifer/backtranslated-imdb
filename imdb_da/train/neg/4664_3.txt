I voted 3 for this movie because it looks good like any Greenaway's output. But it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap. I know many people like this movie, but I got very tired of it very quickly. It is certainly not for everyone. Of course, the ubiquitous McGregor took part in the credibility, but he really shouldn't have wasted his time. I hate sending someone to the pseud corner but please ..... !!! On the plus side, it is visually very attractive, and I enjoyed the music, but couldn't see it through to the end, and I can't say it to many movies. I usually see it all, but it is unbearable !!
