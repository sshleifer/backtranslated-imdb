When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have successors because the first movie is usually the best and that is. Basically now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed outside the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (octopus villain from movie one) Morgana comes to her. When the baby comes out, she asks Ursula sister to transform her into a mermaid that her mother was. This makes Ariel back to the sea to find her. The same good voters, it's just the story that could have been a little more thought. Sufficient!
