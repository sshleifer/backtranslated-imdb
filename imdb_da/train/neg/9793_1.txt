Mighty Morphin Power Rangers have to be the worst TV show ever made. There is no plot, just a bunch of stupid costumed kids using martial arts while dressed in second class spandex outfits. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like they're from the 70s, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is simply horrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the TV show is the toy, only second-class plastic waste fed to our children. <br /> <br /> There are far better shows for your kids to see! <br /> <br /> Try giving your kids something like Nickelodean, they actually show some intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers.
