There are some Stallone movies I like, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who strengthen the country in the desert are willing to survive for at least two days. Also throughout this wilderness, Stallone holds and the company runs across bridges and ladders that provide convenient map cuts or plot units. Supervisors also do not seem to coordinate with the local rescuers. Also bad people who could not hit the side of a stable with really high-tech looking automatic weapons. I liked John Lithow's villain first, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't. Don't break any of his own bad guys or everyone gets killed. Eventually I couldn't believe the character anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth the time to look.
