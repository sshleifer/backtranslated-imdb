It's interesting first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he is only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, so she disappears without notice. He is searching for her, and after a few ends she joins some of her abused childhood and dizzy recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then it seems that the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story. The beginning, while not as exciting as it sounds, is at least tough. So it ceases to be interesting or even very sensible. And the end is so boring, so boring, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you think the writers didn't know what to do with it and were sad to try. What a sorry waste with a good idea!
