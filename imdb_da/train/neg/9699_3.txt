Despite what many others thought of the first movie, I really liked it. This one though. How to sum it up in a word?: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it in part: Here's the plot: Finally, the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has other kinds of problems: Court-Jester, her grandfather, has gone wild, as superen Spliss goes to battle with his gray hair and sells The Royal Offspring for some blond and full hair. In his desperation, Snow White seeks help from Bubi (Otto Walkees) who first has to find his other six dwarf comrades and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to be written on a weekend where the authors were very drunk, but were just under pressure from the studio to write the manuscript. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other players, it is really not worth buying the DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least kind of hides the movie from complete oblivion is the performance of some actors. That's why I gave the move 3/10. Unfortunately, the manuscript is so bad that none of the actors or everyone can cope with the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, they even go across in our reality and unfortunately .. they do nothing fun while they are here. <br /> <br /> Still many great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen (Especially fun): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as the mirror Helge Schneider and many more but unfortunately all these are comedians not able to bring this really bad script to life. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a treat for some hardcore fans, but for regular filmmakers or today DVD renters or buyers, it's not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to rent the movie myself.
