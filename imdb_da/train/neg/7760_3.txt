At the Fiji Islands, the greedy and conscientious owner of Valalola Resort invites Primal Park investors and guests to an opening party of its composition composed of hotel and zoo aimed at finding partners for its discoveries. When a bunch of college littletime thieves put a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt, the main attractions of the zoo? sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils ?? escape, kill hosts and guards for joy. The incredible lame and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I have just seen. The characters are horrible and not fun or comfortable, and the story is a horrible Jurassik Park rip-off with a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically, all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the saber ducks are bulimic and would like to kill for pleasure. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("Attack of the Sabretooth")
