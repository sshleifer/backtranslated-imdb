After seeing KHAKEE, I felt like I was going to see another good movie but unfortunately the movie is a joke and actually trying to introduce Aryeman Afterall, his father, Keshu is the producer. RKS talked so loudly about the film during campaigns, saying that the film has meat as opposed to movies released then, I wonder what movies he was talking about. The movie is actually a typical Masala movie with lots of comedy, romance, action, everything jumbled <br <br /> <br /> The ease with which the kids kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts ever. Imagine the kids kidnap Dawood's family <br /> <br /> The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization <br /> <br /> RKS gives its weakest movie to date, except for some Bachchan scenes where the movie is and drilling. <br /> <br /> Music is boring. Amitabh tries to give his role everything he does well but not his best, even though he expects the face too much when he pulls a trigger and makes a strange appearance while smoking the cigar H is dubbing is not matched properly at times. /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his action and hams <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems expressive, trying too hard, but overdoing it in some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika the best of the party is <br /> <br /> The rest is okay
