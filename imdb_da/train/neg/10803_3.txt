OK so after watching this refreshing movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes out of my life here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom box, gives this child with shaggy hair 3 wishes, the baby wasting his wishes on i forget what, shaq sucks on rapping, and i think that's it. <br /> <br /> So mainly I laughed, I cried ...... but mostly I laughed at the odd comedy that comes from the wonderful acting skills of a nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair. I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and having a great need for a good laugh. <br /> <I want to give it a 3 out of 10 only b / c movie based on 3 magic wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, you would be deleting this horrible movie and letting everyone pretend that Hollywood was not wasting money doing this.
