Of the ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most personable, but in this script, the audience is well ahead of the famous detective. After all, when jockey Douglas Walton stares empty in space, obviously hypnotized and says something like "I have to ride and be killed", I felt it was stupid that no one took it after he was killed . The police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After hating the horse owner, Gene Lockhart is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same, saying she is going to be killed, and then it is deadly killed by a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouted "I got it" as if it were a revelation. The guilty party was, however, wisely hidden, and there was considerable excitement when this party began to hypnotize Lowe to make him jump off a roof.
