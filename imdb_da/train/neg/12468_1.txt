You just have to say: the movie is boring. Cliché on Cliché is confirmed and the stories never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) And therefore some items were added to make the movie more interesting. Then a child dies, resulting in the father's "natural" reaction: Free counseling of the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why nobody knows. Some children become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship. All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I also didn't laugh and cried, I didn't understand an understanding, nor was I forced to learn more or take a case. It didn't matter to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.
