Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-picture character of THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children. It didn't work (and why should it?), So instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by saving "Kid Midas". I would strongly suggest that all future screenwriters should thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy that is one step closer to ISHTAR. What Murphy says or does best, but does not make me wrong about his exquisite comic talent; he does not belong in this movie, and so did DR. Dolittle! The combined violence and visuals are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and it would not have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept shopping at the guy. Talking about visuals, they were pulled out amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential election. Murphy is far better at getting to America and 48 HRS, but this stale movie is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy flavor.
