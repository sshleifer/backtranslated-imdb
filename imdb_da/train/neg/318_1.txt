I stole this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I tried to see it three times, the other because friends would see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny, it's fun." Wrong! I can't get to see this pile of crap after the dream fight / insult war, where the burning guy with a good zinger gets your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after seeing this, you will know the truth. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I've seen a ton of Steven Segal movies, and I've even seen Crossroads twice ... but I still couldn't see this.
