or anyone who asked for Al Cliver, who broke a naked black black guy in a full nelson, your movie has arrived! Movie star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group of $ 6 million ransom to be delivered to their island hide. What they do not expect is the rich Vietnam veterinarian Peter Weston (Cliver), who is hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they didn't really expect was a local tribe who likes to offer young women to their monster cannibal god with blood disorders in their eyes. Exactly the same movie recording created as CANNIBALS, this one is a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly to a hilarious double track and the impossible greasy monster with the rolling eyes (Franco confirms that they were split ping-pong balls on the disc's interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult support region, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most scary things I have ever seen as a guy who is not quite him at all - close to trying to be him). The movie has tons of nudity and gore (Tempra paint black) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slow fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splash waves. Unfortunately, Oil Jess asks this one for an astonishing (and sometimes disturbing) one hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes peaks. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice, but there are some strange ghost images going on in some of the darker scenes. A long section of dialogue is also in Spanish without any subs (they are an option, but only when listening to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16 minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
