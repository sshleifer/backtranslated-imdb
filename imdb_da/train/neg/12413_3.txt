I don't want to say that this movie is horrible because I've seen worse, but it's not even halfway decent. <br /> <br /> The reason is very confusing. I couldn't really figure out what happened and where things went. When the film was over, I was scraping back my head. I looked through to the end of the credits to see if they had something for those who can clean up, but when the credits were over, it was. I felt I was greedy from a weak plot point to another throughout the movie, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> Character development is very low. I couldn't figure out when someone was angry or angry with anyone. I couldn't tell if half of the characters were just full, rocky, mentally challenged, or they just had a bad actor portraying them. This movie seems to be based on stereotypes (for it is credit, they are hard to avoid using when making a movie about a singer in a rock band), which should make character development easier, as so many other movies already has illustrated the suffering of an abused child or attempted a heroin addict trying to get clean. Stereotypes are easy to portray, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overpower stereotypical characters. However, this movie uses stereotypical characters to the left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be rejected without explanation. I think it's OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really didn't get a chance to know any of them, so I've never really missed any of them. And last but not least, sadie song. It's terrible. The music that supports her is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned by the screams released from Sadie's vocal cords. I swear that there is a point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I should be turned off during this shelf-a-thon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing. Characters are poorly developed, Georgia's appearance is wood and stiff, Sadie's character is yanked from a bad situation to another, without a back story or explanation. The music was unbearable and I can't think of any good reason to watch this movie unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.
