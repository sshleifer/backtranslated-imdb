Mona vagabond lives on the edge of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I may have missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality, while it through life to be rude to people, to be loud and not to contribute anything to everyone's life. She is not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. <br /> <br /> I've seen and known enough people like this: There is no secret importance to what they are doing. They're just lazy pimples. I don't want Mona anywhere near me as she tends to steal something that is not nail down and let her friends break. Sure she is enigmatic - because there is nothing for her. Lots of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I also didn't want to see a movie about them. <br /> <br /> There may be something I completely missed. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews are from people who assume something done by a French female instructor is high art.
