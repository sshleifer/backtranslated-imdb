Just PPV'd this. I don't want to waste too much time on this, as most posters here put it better than I ever could, but I'd like to say a few things. I didn't know which was more fun: Redgrave is chasing small mills and stumbling across his nurse; Close to her "precious" boy (whom she and Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been transformed into a roadkill; that the toned-down Ann foamed with Peggy Lee; or the awful CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie stares at her younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave. Nor did I buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she gets a better mother to give her a few lessons! I had no idea that any girl (or buddy) would be fooled by the vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are so whiny and thoughtless as she, Luc is a delayed slacker on crack and I didn't give any advice on any of them! Evening, Chick Flicks gives a bad name!
