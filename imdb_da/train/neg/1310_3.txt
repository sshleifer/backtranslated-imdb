The reason is even an old man lives off a highway in the forest one day witnesses to a man who kills a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempt to convince the police that what he saw was not a fantasy of his imagination. However, there is a problem each time the old leader guides where the murder does not take place, the body can be found. Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue that reflects the majority of movie scenes, an old man who lives in himself in a house. During the film I found that I was scared twice, namely when the murdered child suddenly appeared to the old man. The rest of the movie I have to admit didn't involve me; I found the movie's pace a little too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. But the evolution of history and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too long. I feel that more could have been created by the relationship, ghostly encounters with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some scary situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
