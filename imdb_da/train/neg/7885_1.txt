I believe in keeping religion outside the government and out of the movies. When I want a sermon, I go to church, but I don't want one from a movie. I don't mind some supernatural themes (after all, religion is as supernatural as you can get!) But this movie had so much preaching in it that I was really annoyed. The hostess reminded me of witches seen in other films. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a silly ended: The hero entered the meeting and shouted at all the old men and it broke spell. If only life was so simple. I think when movies are so stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREACHING NOTE HERE!
