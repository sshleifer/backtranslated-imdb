In a dorm dorm, a guy is killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She is institutionalized. A year later she is out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and will be spending Spring Break with Hank and four other thoughtless friends in a great, beautiful condo in Florida. Of course, the killer arises (without reason) and begins to kill again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller - a textbook example of how NOT to make a low budget horror movie. Initially, large parts of this movie ENDLESS filler of these six idiots video tape itself, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), being drunk, acting stupid, etc. There's also no nudity in here. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but something to live this would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are just a little bloody and there are none. There's a really cruel one - but it's not to the end. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, the play sucks. Dorie Barton is horrible as the biggest woman and Tom Jay Jones is miserable as Oz. Chad Allen shows up as Brad and he is AWFUL. Lawrence is actually very good - beautiful and hunky and gives this crap his all. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role that does a good job. <br /> <br /> Logic lapses - after they realize that a friend has been killed, two of the girls talk sexually; Baston's lack of response to seeing a friend being killed is a bit of fun and what happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Dull, stupid, no one does, no nudity - skip this one. <br /> <br /> Rated graphically for graphic violence and some profanity.
