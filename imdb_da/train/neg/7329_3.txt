After watching this movie, I felt the convincing need to vent a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was pretty charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, though not original, certainly showed a promise. None of it was anything but at all. <br /> <br /> I don't know what her agreement is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. She lowered recordings, jumped up footage, reversed recordings, used uncomfortable camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cut, jumped back and forth in the timeline, and topped it up with an unpleasant "modern" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw an incompetent job of leading a movie. Her ego must struggle to wipe out the play and the story and set its direction in front and center for the audience members to notice. It's stuffed into the throat. <br /> <br /> There are a few good scenes in "Kill Me Later" that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things were beginning to show promise, Mrs Lustig would dig into her bag of movie school tricks and stifle things again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the movie really had a good heart. 3.10
