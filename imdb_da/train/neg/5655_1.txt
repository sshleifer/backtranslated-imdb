The Egyptian movie has many high-level films of drama or romance or comedy or action even sport ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lamb" was banned in Egypt because it content Nudity (Full Frontal Female Nudity) and this kind of necessity is banned in Egyptian films. When I watched these movies, I felt ... Fool Story .. Naked actress. Bad action .. Some horror and horrible colors. Dear friend .. If you want to see a good Egyptian movie ... Simply: Stay away form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lamb". We have great movies in Egypt ... We have a great actor who won a global win as: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great leaders like "Yousef Shahin", so believe me. You don't have to watch this movie ..
