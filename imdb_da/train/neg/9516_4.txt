Frank Sinatra plays a non-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, live and hard-drinker who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his alien brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the city is the big hit with an uninterested wife and headstrong daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and lie down with a good woman. Simplified dramaturgy on soap opera, with a role for MacLaine, which, conversely, is "colorful" and embarrassing sentimental (her drunk belt on "After You've Gone", however, is the highlight of the movie and handled academically). Director Vincente Minnelli monitors it on an equal footing, but he is in surprisingly glamorous spirits, and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly beautiful on widescreen, with a good eye for detail and composition, but the story and these figures are stuck in dregs. ** from ****
