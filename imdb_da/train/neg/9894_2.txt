I missed the beginning of this movie, which can explain why I didn't like it so much. On the other hand, I have been studying the fall of the Roman Republic for many years, so I know the story. So again, that may also be the reason why I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not believe they made an attempt to correct it, in which case it can be forgiven. The odd thing is that they sometimes go in great lengths to be historically accurate, that it ends up being confusing. Like throwing Antonius's marriage with Octavia, then pushing it aside two scenes later. Why even bring it up if it doesn't serve any purpose for the plot and the Octavia is never even seen? And like calling Antony with his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Although historical inaccuracies were present, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady. There is no ounce of dignity in her. She is hysterical, dramatic and lacks control herself. Instead of being a smart and complex queen, Cleopatra becomes a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS. 95% of it comes from the poor, but 5% is also from poor script writing. Too many silly dramatic scenes are written into the script. Sometimes you didn't look at Antony and Cleopatra while looking at immature versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> To see something about this period, see ... anything but this.
