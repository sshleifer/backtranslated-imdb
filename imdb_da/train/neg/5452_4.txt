As far as film goes, it's good enough. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting enough history. I would really have liked it if I hadn't been terribly annoyed as I watched the complete disrespect, it shows the city it's set in. Glasgow. In Scotland. Nevertheless, each character is English (except Sean's girlfriend who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in opinion jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes her "real life" movies to be a bit more like real life), I really don't think it would hurt to use one of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or at least got English ones that could throw together a decent accent! The unsuccessful attempt to use the word "wee" a few times did nothing but promote the insult.
