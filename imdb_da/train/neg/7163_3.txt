<br /> <br /> When I finished my show of "Trance" or "The Eternal" or what the producers call this movie, I wondered, "Out of all the bad movies I could have seen, I couldn't at least have seen an entertaining one? "Although a movie is not well-made to act, control, write, or what you have, it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile. But not only is this film poor in artistic value, it is incredibly boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves very slowly, with a little dramatic tension. At least one could, in a low attempt at entertainment, be dead and crooked, but the creators of this boy also succeeded in that department. <br /> <br /> What has this movie been about? Almost nothing unless you get entertainment watching Christopher Walken, who is able to be brilliant, put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-parody mode (why did he still choose to make the movie?). <br /> I give this movie 3/10 because God helps us who have actually been worse movies made before.
