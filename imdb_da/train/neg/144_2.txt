There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad this movie is. It's a shame that I actually sat through this movie, this very tedious and predictable movie. What is wrong with that? Acting: There is no performance that is just distant from being underpaired (at least they are all very beautiful). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get Orgy on the soundtrack, everyone will know they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but everyone with a keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. Don't even get me started on "What the hell?" moments, here are a few: Killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actress, nobody is there, returns, there is something sitting in front of her. From now on, when the killer turns out with a power drill, a really big one! The filmmakers get points for at least joining it, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find the outlet to put it in. I want one of the guards at the beginning of Holy Grail and will say "Where did you get the power out?". I could go on with how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words. I will give this 2 out of 10 stars. A star to make me laugh and another star for the whole split. Always don't play your time with this one.
