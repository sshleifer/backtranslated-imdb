And when I see Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and jaw-worthy. She is also completely lacking in anything humorous. The deadpan way she's trying to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not fun. I saw two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my child (19 years old) saw her promos at Comedy Central and said she was a "stupid chicken". I thought it was a compliment. The one where she says "Watch my show or I will kill my dog" is actually credible. I know she is one, will be comedienne. She just comes across as a spoiled nut. I just never want to see her around my dog.
