Scandalous trashy karate / horror thriller with lots of graphic gory violence and free nudity, and a thorough preposterous and bizarre "plot". This is lowbrow and low grade entertainment that only appeals to viewers with particularly kinky tastes, but it's a little cheerful bad, and I have to admit I wasn't boring while I watched it .... (* 1/2)
