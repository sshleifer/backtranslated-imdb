I loved the first "Azumi" movie. I've seen Ms Ueto in a variety of TV shows and I've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. I must say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> In view of the movie's cast and created in "Azumi" they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in parts and strewn with a lot of poor, convincing and wooden plays. <br /> <br /> As they pleaded to refer to the first movie, they did it in a way that was pretty loose and weak. In "Azumi", the title character is the best of a group superior killed. In "Azumi 2" she somehow diminishes and less impressive. <br /> <br /> That's not to say it was a total loss. There were a few decent fighting scenes and some over-the-top characters. Unfortunately, the film generally suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The latter two really caught the "manga" feeling in their manuscript while the former never quite "got it".
