This is one of the issues I can relate to a little more than most, since I hate noise and have no idea how in big cities, New York, especially how people get any sleep at all! It confuses me that people can stand whole noise out there these days. The basic plot of the movie is that it provides an interesting subject. It's too bad, it's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent, although there are not a few scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel that sees Margarita Leiveva) he didn't seem to be quite there. My biggest hope for this movie is that casting agents will see the amazing and talented actress starting Margarita Levieva. She doesn't have much to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. Even when trying to get her to look at more girls next door. It makes me sad that there may be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world without profitable skills or talent to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I didn't care much about this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I got to see some new talent. I hope manufacturers and directors think of Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be there in big budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star (that she's not so hot and her acting "talent" is worse than made for Disney channel TV shows) from 1 movie, it should be easy for her as she is beautiful and have talent! I would recommend her to change her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more negotiable. Here hope this will make her career, and if there is any justice, she can come up with a big summer movie or two in the next few years.
