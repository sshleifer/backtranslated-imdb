I missed the start, but I looked mostly. A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room at FYE. The sketches are all very short, but most are still too long. Most of them they seem to have forgotten to have something fun! A lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor in it, sketches based on stereotypes or sketches that use racist conditions for humans. I try to remember everything I thought was fun in it, and I have problems .... The Tunnel Vision Network logo is a lipstick with an eye on it. The mouth opens and closes over the eye as an eyelid. Kind of scary. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors went on to better things and it is fortunate that this bomb did not hold them back.
