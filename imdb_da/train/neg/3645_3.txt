A youth gets a bad hair day, goes out on a hill and falls into where he can't escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" guy from 2000 years ago as his very best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound-like. His Herculean strength helps the boy out of danger and later adapts to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the lusiest idea for a "family" outing! In any way, this should not have been tried really at all! Our fictional character of power and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger that seems common to the rest of the universe. To add to the blasphemy, the lack of something new or appealing, and before you know it, there is some attempt at violence that does not qualify this as "family" entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains about his undershorts, however, is gaggling. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
