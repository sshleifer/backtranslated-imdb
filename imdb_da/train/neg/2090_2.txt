I realize that it should not be BSG and I can handle slow pace if they are interesting, but I find myself totally uninterested and sad about this series. The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama The formula for Caprica seems to be: Among Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Perhaps it gets more interesting, but from episode 3 I can hardly see it. In fact, it is at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week. This is a sad state. The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night lineup. Whatever happened to SG1, Stargate Atlantis, and BSG on Friday nights? They had a good thing there.
