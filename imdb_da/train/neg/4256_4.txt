Ascension is actually a step in relation to what the original movie was in history and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee Is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is fun as Luke, the child who helps the woman he loves from a long steal Dracula's body from the plate. Diane Neal is good as the woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original film. Roy Scheider rounds off the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as a mentor for Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second successor in the trilogy, and they are starting a good start. It's up to the air, if the last movie closes the series on a good note.
