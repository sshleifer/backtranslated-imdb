Thomas Clay has interfered with the wrong types. It's trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main film of the movie is slow and pretty stodgy, and ambles to the fabric are scary end up as if it is director, it has no where better to go. We are introduced to the main title character, which is a bit of an outsider, we see him in school and at home not quite fit in, feel awkward in himself as so many young people do. Robert falls in with bad boys and starts to go to school and take drugs, and before you know it, he is a psychoist. <br /> <br /> The film is really about Clay's total lack of understanding of the links between violence and violence. Clay seems to think that a generation of crazy youth is being wicked by war scenes on our television. however, he has filmed the most obnoxious piece of simulated violence. Is this guy really? <br /> <br /> If Clay hasn't seen YouTube, is he perhaps naive and unaware of being made with the brutal climax scene from his movie? Everything anyone wants to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the movie, and I'm sure it will be what sticks to people. The rest of the film is meaningless in committing such an act of violence to film Clay, not only doomsday young people who are actively involved in preventing war but also killing themselves as an offender for extremely tasteless violence are no better than their own personal celebrity status. . <br /> <br /> Shame on everyone involved.
