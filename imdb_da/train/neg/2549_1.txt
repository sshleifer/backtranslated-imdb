my friend bought the movie for 5 ?? (it's not even worth 1 cent) because they wrote it was like American pie. but we will soon find out that there is a long way from American pie to that piece of shit. It's not even a comedy, it's more like a really really really bad documentary. Not only the story is bad, also the picture and sound suck. they put in some alcohol, chickens, dwarfs and drunk teens. And the result is a disaster. If you see this movie don't buy it, better spend your money on something else and better. If you want to torture yourself, do not invite your friend / s unless you hate a lot and you will get rid of them.
