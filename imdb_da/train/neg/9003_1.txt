This movie really, I really mean, suck. It has plot holes so large and 30 feet dragon can fit through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which inevitably is the worst computer-generated image ever to be put on the film right. I mean, when you see something like this, think "Wow, someone actually made this movie. Then released it. Who they are, I'm sure they no longer work in the movie industry. <br /> <br / > When I hired this movie, it was not on DVD, so I (reluctantly) put it on video. The first thing to see was the Lord of the Rings, for the two towers, this was a very smart move to put this trailer on the video, it entitles me (reluctantly) to give the movie 1 star, otherwise I would have given it zero stars, maybe the producers, although Dean Cain's star attraction (I think that's how you spell it) would pull in the crowds ( uh, for the video store that is. Next, they used split screen technique (like in Hulk) to (I assume) to compensate for what a cruelty this piece of movie profile is.On the box cover we see a picture of our hero and dragon Looks like the dragon in Dragonheart, or is it just me? look like a rejection from Gremlins 2, and have CGI from a Nintendo video game crook from the early 90s (maybe worse). Also not Dragons movement as it pursues its victims - its same monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg left body, judgment, judgment, judgment DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! It's just pissing me off. Perhaps the filmmakers thought this was exciting and would have the same effect as Jaws. Why not have a Dragon POV shot. Either way, it was just fun, much like watching a Weebl toon. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives many confused appearances during the movie (perhaps he may say that this movie could end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was an add-on to a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's so bad that my 5-year-old brother can come up with better ones when he no doubt tries to lie about why he shook around in my room while I wasn't Was there. Oh, and I mention that I F @ # KING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN THIS INKREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS MOVIE? !!!
