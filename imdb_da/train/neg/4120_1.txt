Absolutely horrible movie. Ameteurish and it's not fun at all. The lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Changes to E.T and the Star Wars are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think of this movie. He was to master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can't find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal, this film is a garbage. Director Gani Mujde is a cartoon writer and this film is his worst written work to this date. Cem Karaca's music is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also has some presence. Actor who plays the three sons has no talent ever.
