I saw this with a growing sense of turmoil. Why does God help Ian Hunter help these special people in their attempt to escape from Devils Island? And what did he do in the first place? I think I know God is working in mysterious ways, but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness, and heart changes in such a deserted location .... In any case, it's hardly a sympathetic movie. Regardless of what Gable had charms in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man, Crawford is as loving as she was to me, not at all, and the whole look of the movie makes it seem like it was made 10 many years before. Compared to contemperane films such as "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", it looks prehistoric.
