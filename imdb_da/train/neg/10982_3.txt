Movies had some good plays and good moments (though of course it's pretty low budget), but poor rating due to the basic premise is poorly developed. The main point of conflict between the two leaders does not reflect in a realistic way at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no great depth discussions that would explain how they can be together while they see the world so differently, especially as Glenn's employment is so settled in this part of his life (and Adam is active enough with his, that he supports it with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively to be the way he is (sorry Adam for his past) while Adam turns out be upright and "traditional," as the film proclaims to be the "good" way in the end. I don't like being preached to like it. I attended a discussion session with the director after seeing the LTR, and he said he presented this conflict between them because he, if he was in Glenn's shoes (and he said he does it in fact, relates Glenn's vision) that he could never dance anyone with Adam's views. Well, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the movie. Also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) Directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave movies that feel frustrated.
