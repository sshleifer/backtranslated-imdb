After watching this movie, I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or whether the cinema's sound system might be defective. At least the first half of the movie, it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the background 20's music and the gap of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment, but not so - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told the subject of my complaint was an important part of the film's presentation. The music and sound had to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days, directors will go in many lengths to make their movie unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you watch the movie, the sound result will be the same. <br /> <br /> So apart from the historical inaccuracies in this movie (which you can find elsewhere) the soundtrack Distortions is in itself a good reason to miss this movie. You only hear the distorted junk of the soundtrack and certainly not a cat's mud.
