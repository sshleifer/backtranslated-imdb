I would have given it one instead of a two, but I suppose it could have been worse. I suppose the play is not so bad, but the plot lacks something even externally close to interesting. It's a horrible movie !! TERRIBLE! Totally waste of time! I strongly suggest you not see this movie. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
