I have had to change my view of the worst movie in the world that has just seen this. This is it! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> Hopeless story (despite being based on a true story). Horrible acting (what was judge Reinhold thinking) Unbelieveably bad stunts. Childish dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture? <br /> <br />
