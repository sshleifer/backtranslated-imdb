Penn takes the time to develop his characters and we are very worried about them. But there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the timeline is turned up. Probably set in 1963, the music is late in the 60s / early 70s. The references and dialogue are the 70s / 80s. The potential for a strong climax presents itself, and Penn allows it to slip away. But even with all these difficulties, it is worth seeing, but not good.
