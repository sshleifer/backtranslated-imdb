If you are one of those people who find "According to Jim" great TV comedy, it will rock your world. And maybe I'll add, kudos to prove the good talent, good writing and a charismatic star, is all you really need on a different network than ABC, who prefers to sail like Jim Belusy's show year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a large, steaming, brown, German shepherd-sized "thank you" for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. That's exactly what fans of that movie and the smaller Belushi deserve. Jim's comic chops and choices in projects are never far behind his ability to slaughter a blues standard. Look for him to try to showcase all his multifarious talent in every project, throwing the public like a surly zoo chimp. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
