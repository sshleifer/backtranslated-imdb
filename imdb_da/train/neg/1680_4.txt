Even with a cast that boasts so generally reliable names like Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to give deep sense to this movie. It just brushes the surface of the events that happened on July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the moves when John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth both hopefully fail in the other two roles; as Holmes wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the casting has such small roles that it is impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film also comes from Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a Paris Hilton cameo.
