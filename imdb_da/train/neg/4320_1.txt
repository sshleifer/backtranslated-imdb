First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people who are looking to see something exciting and happy about the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mother who is down at Christmas because her husband has lost her job, they lose their house, cannot buy Christmas gifts for the kids, etc. You get the idea, good things for the holiday. Thus, Harry Dean Stanton comes as Gideon, the Christmas angel who, in his dark hat and long coat, comes more like a pedophile hanging around children all day and observing them. What better way to infuse Christmas spirit into Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is an extortionist and his Christmas workshop looks more like a paradise for refugee Nazis on the lamb. The film puts it all so thick that you don't care about the happy end when it comes, because the rest of the movie is so bitter and incredible. I'm sure this movie would be something like Capra-like, but it gave off the joy and mood of what a holiday movie should be.
