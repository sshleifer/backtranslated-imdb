Remade today, this movie would be a very scary, very disturbing dark comedy. Stalking, obsession and a web of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 sheen of non-sweet beauty. Drake plays the stalker, an unmanned user of humans, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the stalking victim, alternately angry and ignorant. <br /> <br /> Highly disturbing; I have not been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since. <br /> <br />
