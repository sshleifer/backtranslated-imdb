I saw this recent Woody Allen movie because I am a fan of his work, and I make it an attempt to see everything he does, even though the reviews of this movie made me expect a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confused movie that cannot determine whether it will be a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama of female middle-class crisis. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless medieval woman who has married great wealth and leads a life of effortless luxury with her little boring husband and their two young children. This rather terrestrial plot concept is revived with such inconsistencies as an ancient Chinese folk carnation that makes her invisible with some magical herbs and the ghost of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound great to you, what about something more prosaic, like an affair with a saxophone player? <br /> <br /> I was never quite sure what this mixed muddle was trying to say. There are only a handful of really fun moments in the movie and the ending is a really enchanting handshake of Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> Clean 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead a superbly-suited film that stems from combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
