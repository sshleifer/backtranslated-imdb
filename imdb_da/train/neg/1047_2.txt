Someone has to explain to me why every film that contains poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow seen as "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything realistic about the characters (though the actors did their best with really bad parts) or the situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "edgy", "gritty" and "down and dirty". Unfortunately, it takes much more than keeping the camera without rhyme or the reason not to turn on the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way. It is a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only movies that see the inside of a movie theater are today all carbon copies, with poor filmography, non-existent camera direction and a lot of swords striving to pass even as "Art". It's no wonder that movies like "In the Bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such raves. I found them to be meandering and very average, but compared to the current kill of independent clones like "Raising Victor Vargas" they are absolutely brilliant and inspired. Some years ago, when an "independent" movie meant that you would probably be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and perhaps a few technical flaws due to the low budgets, it means today that chances are that You get another by-the-numbers, let's -shake-the-camera-around-for-to-hours attempt to place the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course, all that serves characters and situations that are completely unreal and constructed. <br /> <br /> Is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer survivors? Not at all when watching movies like Raising Victor Vargas who doesn't do anything but copying the worst of the movies that preceded them.
