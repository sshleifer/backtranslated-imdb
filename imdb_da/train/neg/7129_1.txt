This would be best known for Ferrari who was overthrown when Eddie Griffin made promotion. <br /> <br /> Speech of racing and betting are poorly made by the numbers that seem to have a director who could not see numbers. Virtually a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck. This is not a good movie, but it is not bad enough to be observable and end up as something no movie is worth to bother, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact, one of the leaders is a woman, Misogynistic, it is a movie made clear to the producer and director close to beautiful girls. Do you want proof? There are long lingering shots of women in almost nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get an increase out of people who are also afraid to rent a porn or sports display swimsuit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
