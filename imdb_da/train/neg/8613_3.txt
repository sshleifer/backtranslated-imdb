I almost blew tears and watched this movie. Not from laughs, but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had him at his best, and Back To School is by far an 80-year-old classic masterpiece. Then there were Ladybugs, and that was when it began to show. Bad Rodney got old (Meet Wally Sparks was a little step up from Ladybugs but not much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives, Rodney Monte (a name he must love since it was his name in Easy Money) plays a rich (who is not always) guy who loves women and gets married like his nothing. Now he inherits a large piece of land, and since the land was run by Amish, he inherits 5 wives. It sounds like a good idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is everything. The script is so bad that Rodney seems to say his one line to the camera and all the page signs have nothing to do. The movie looks like it was shot on video with some really bad stunt sequences that are apparently not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster that looks like he's dying to say the F-word (as he should when the movie is rated R, but plays like it was PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2-minute como. Don't make me wrong, sometimes I laugh at a few Rodney's jokes, but the poor man gets too old and too slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. And the movie becomes too PC, which thanks to the dreadful 1990s, the 70s and 80s Rodney just no longer work.
