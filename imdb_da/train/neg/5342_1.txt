Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all on top form here. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm also a big fan of the TV show. Their music rocks and they are all so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE CLUB FAN, DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The shows are terribly weak, the dialogue is horrible, and the jokes aren't even done correctly (I'm sorry the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small, passionate S Club fans don't laugh. They thought they could do better. And they did. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat, ugly who started a mosh band", must thank his lucky stars as he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. Beware of this movie! Don't go see it! YOU WILL NOT DO! YOU MUST CRY! 0/10 RJT
