Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and not called topper? Go figure! <br /> <br /> This travesty makes a gross injustice to the largest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young to old, blonde-haired and white-haired and kills people to shoot the gun out of their hands. Will the real Hopalong please stand up! <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever made, and believe it or not, by the person who brought us the grandfather's story!
