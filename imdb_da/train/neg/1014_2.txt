Timberlake's performance almost attacked the screen. It wasn't that bad, I just think the reporter's role was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, the toughest, crooked guy around. I don't think it was a smile in the whole movie, not even when it was suggested to her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The Morgan Freeman barred the entire movie. He had some fun scenes that are the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey wasn't good or bad, he was just "there". All in all, it's boring. movie. bad plot. many bad plays or wrong roles for actors.
