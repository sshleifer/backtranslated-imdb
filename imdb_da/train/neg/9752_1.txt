I honestly can't believe what suits entertainment now. Death (and fun of death), violence, sexually induced, adult threatening children, cruelty, alcohol abuse of minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and obese people and children slipping out of the house in the middle of at night - yup, sounds like a kids movie for me - NOT !!! In addition, the dark and scary elements - a dead woman who possesses and turns into a house and holds her loving husband captive for over 20 years and also terrorizes an entire neighborhood - how sweet for children. Parents - is this really what you want your kids to see - is this what you want to teach them about life? <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for young kids, and I'm afraid teenagers can live this movie scene today - so why rub it in their faces? As for an adult audience, you won't find it scary or entertaining - just boring, constructed and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters and beer drinkers / female lovers. What good material for children - does it really sound like a children's movie to anyone? Even computer animation and good voice work is not enough to redeem this horrible flick. Save your money, save your time and save your children's minds - hire Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - Some of them are far better than this horrid movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a child / family movie !!
