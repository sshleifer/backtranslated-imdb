So what is the great fate of making an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor cast as a fictional guy from adventure story books who won't go on an adventure ??? Anyone who wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for whatever reason it was possible, this movie is missing out on excitement! It does not mean that it has no action, but look at the dark side of the picture. This has to bear no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure thrills containing cliff hangers and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED was promoted that way by using smart propaganda to make me and more others interested in it! Besides, I've never heard of the guy, so who needs his attention?
