The worst thing about Crush is not that it has acted badly or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it is not even so bad that the camera work could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a couple of amazing moments that keep you hoping for more to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you're a fan of violin music and cheap tower competing scenes on 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then don't miss it. <br /> <br /> I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the above things in a movie, and as a result, I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can't make up for the rest of it. <br /> <br /> Judgment: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time. <br /> <br />
