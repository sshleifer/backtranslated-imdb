The Wicker One has made the impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind. Yes it's really that bad. So bad that when I sat down to write this review I thought of myself: "If I could choose to watch this movie again or have red, hot needles pushed in my eyes," I can actually go to the reds , needles. <Br /> <br /> Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a free mind "Yes, it's a bad direction right there". <br /> <br /> I think the first clue I should have been the roof line myself: "Some victims have to be done". Sure it may sound kind of naughty spooky to intrigue you, but the victim will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me in that the people responsible for this movie must be accused of hate crime ... or at least fraud to try to transfer it as something reminiscent of entertainment. Seriously! The film is about an island where men are only there for breeding, and I would still rather be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice, so find myself stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the highest speed I've ever heard in a movie theater. It's not a joke or it's fictitious. I have never been in a "thriller" and heard so much laughter throughout the movie. I can't tell you for sure if the laughter was deliberate with some effort to ease the cinematic excitement, or if they just thought this crude would fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or maybe a struggle to break out into the cinema, all to make this more interesting, which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each for the movie, just for a little mental anesthesia (soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, do not delay). At one point I actually thought that this movie is really a spoof, and Anna Ferris will show up? Oh what I want. Nic Cage throws so much ham per Frame I am thinking of has a cholesterol test done today. Thinking that I ever thought Sean Penn was a dk to slam Nics play, he's still a d * ck just less of one? Yes Sean Penns d * ck was diminished because of this movie. Make us all a service Nic plays your forces and keeps us from being pathetic losers and drunks. You can not play superman you are not going to play strong hunky roles go straight in prison do not go, do not go collect $ 200. His best moments in this movie are when he finally comes unheard of and actually knocks out a burly woman to steal her bear clothes (like the fix, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then continues to run crazy as Conan O ' Brian's masturbating bear, but with half of a bear's cavity knocking his junk around. Fortunately, he meets his end shortly after it turns out that he must be a victim of the public on the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just pampered the end to you, and if you knew anything better, you would build statues of me in worship and sing songs in my legend. I sat through this crap party so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> About halfway through this little accident, I continued to think of myself. Jack Bauer would have packed this case up for 20 minutes in real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim is first attacked by a mountain rental. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out within an hour? And you're not Clouseau's inspector. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you are taken captive and you have the choice to watch this movie or grab a ball, grab the ball. <br /> <br /> A place where Uwe Boll laughs at us all.
