"A Damsel in Distress" is certainly not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad movies have always had some good moments. In "Damsel" is Astaire Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal show. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heir who jumps into a cab he takes to escape admiration of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry thinks Alice is forced to marry her rich aunt. He tries to save her from her family's country mansion, but soon discovers that house staff are betting on which wife Lady Alice will marry. Kegg's (Reginald Gardiner) the passing butler and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, every turn alternately helps and sabotages Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has many problems. First, the plot is based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who wrote plays). The story is slow, painful and nerve grating. When Fred does not dance, we must endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the house boy are especially annoying. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of boys you just want to beat in your mouth. You want them to come out of the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers from his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a noisy leading lady in this movie and is miscast in a musical. She has a little for her, characteristic, apart from her lovely face and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are together on the tour, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds a very hard needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some fun lines, but she is also very annoying at times. <br /> <br /> The movie's direction of George Stevens is not well done. At times, cinematography is awful and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are amazing, and they have become classic song standards. And of course, the dance in the movie is extraordinary, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But musical and dance tracks are badly used and irregular. At times, the casting seems to start singing and dancing because it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers appear randomly inserted in the meandering plot. (At one point the butler goes outside the manor and breaks into an operetta solo for no apparent reason.) The figures include:  "I'm dancing and I can't be bothered now" - Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London Street. He makes a big "rattan" with a rolled umbrella - but the number ends prematurely when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In Broadway music "Crazy For You" Harry Groener made a much better version of this song with a group of corpses.) <br /> <br />  "Put me to the test" - Fred, George and Gracie make a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred, step by step, but the number ends badly with anyone kicking each other for no reason. <br /> <br />  "Stiff upper lip" - in an amusement park fun House, Fred, George and Gracie have fun dancing on the rotating floor, rotating barrel and with the fun house mirrors. It is the movie's best number, but it is sometimes a bit repetitive. <br /> <br />  "Things look up" - Fred and Joan Fontaine make their one dance number together in the movie and jumping around the rear forest of the country manor. Fortunately, it is a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  "A foggy day in London Town" - Fred walks around the misty manor at night and wars on the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he is not sure which way he goes in the fog - just like the musical number itself. <br /> <br />  "Nice work if you can get it" - A good song abused in the movie. During a social event in the manor, Fred is drawn into a choir of dour-faced singers who accompany the song this song. Every time Fred enters, the other singers see him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener made a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You".)  "Drum Dance Number" - When Fred and Joan are about to elope, Fred must stop and make a last tap dance number while you beats a group of drums. As usual, it's a good dance number. But there is absolutely no reason for that, except for prolonging the film. <br /> <br /> The most motivated moment in the movie comes when Fred decides to jump out of a high-rise barn on the farm to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. When he jumps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently placed trapeze - that's right, a * trapeze * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather a stuntman in Fred's clothing) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth owning a DVD for the dance songs alone, but you feel the debt to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. >> The FF button allows you to jump through the other boring scenes in the movie to get to the dance numbers.
