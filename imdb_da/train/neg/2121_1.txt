Frankly, it also seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that I just can't stand anymore? I think he just wants hellbent to be taken seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how bias it is, but unless he goes through some new plays, I can never see him win one. He is a big name and is therefore generally mistaken for being a talented and diverse actor. He's just not. I give him credit for trying so hard and being able to cry at the drop of a hat. It's about it. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds was a kind of earring for me right from the start. The suicide 911 call didn't interest me in any way. I was not curious to know why he called in his own suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best thing I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had something decent on screen chemistry. I also don't know her name, but the Latin American woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time, but I would say he stole the show every time he was on. All in all, just an extreme run of the mill's original plot. I couldn't help asking myself all the way through why I was worried about any of these people. Never once felt sorry for 'Tim / Ben'. He killed himself with a jellyfish? Was the only survivor in an 8 person accident? Geewiz .. don't see anything coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is pretty generous.
