I saw this on the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheapo - nothing wrong with it, but you have to do it with a little sex or do or both. <br /> <br /> Think Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers to hang her I guess. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the spaceship comes down is fun - you could picture all the crewmen shaking it around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I want the people who did it well - at least it's not pretentious.
