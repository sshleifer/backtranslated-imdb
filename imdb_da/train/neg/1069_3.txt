I watched this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I didn't. It stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a fine job in this movie of 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and adultery with the third. It all takes place at a sea house and it looks wonderful. The film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and I thought it was necessary to be the reverse.
