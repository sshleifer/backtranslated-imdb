"Lies" tells of an affair between an 18-year-old bucktoothed female student and a scary 38-year-old married man with the two protesters who spend about half the screen time involved in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half wobbles through the pathetic naive story that seems a little more than an excuse for the sex scenes. With very poor production value, including obvious hygiene devices and false softcore sex for a story that is a messy mix of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes superfluous ad nauseam. With almost 2 hours of running, subtitles and so little substance, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (C)
