Imagine that the real Hitler, who was a propaganda star and speaking, would have been as murky as Carlyle portrayed him in this movie. No one would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda in itself, spoiled as "true story". I regret anyone who actually believed anything from this show. Carlyle and the producers didn't get anything right about this. Why was Hitler able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as such a loser, they make their own movie absolutely incredible. This film is a mix of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill, where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk to an actor like Carlyle in this drunk.
