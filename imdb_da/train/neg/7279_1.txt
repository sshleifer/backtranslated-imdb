I just watched this movie at a local TV station (TV8's "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio) I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I know no thesaurus It can even come close to helping me describe how bad this movie really is. Scripture is horrible. The action, other than one of two exceptions, is meaningless, since nothing in this material deserves any real effort. It looks like a bunch of little ideas, remnants from various written sessions that where thrown into a blender. It's not just fun. The "Parody" aspect is strained at best. Some references where it is almost obsolete (even at the time of release). No wonder I had never heard of it, it was really bad, worse than any Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even live color laid out in their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, this is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do, don't throw a cent. <br /> <br /> Adam
