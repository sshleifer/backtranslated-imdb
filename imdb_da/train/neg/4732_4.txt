If I write a review about a movie, it might stick to me ... but generally I expect I have forgotten that I have seen this just two weeks from now. So why bother? Because again I find myself watching a low rated movie that was fun to watch. I didn't expect me to be in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It wasn't amazing, but at least it wasn't unbearable ... not a bug that always makes me ring. It was just sweet fluff ... and if you can't take it, you'll be in the wardrobe boys. I agree with those who defend this movie because it is safe to satisfy their targeted demographic and it will not be a total birth for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers a few good chuckles here and there but nary a side splitter. Sure it is stupid and only mildly entertaining, but at least it doesn't suck (as many have said it does). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive pages? <br /> <br /> I tend to rate on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 is actually an okay all-round rating in my book. Giving it a 4 makes sense and will strengthen its rating at the time of this writing. If it gives a 1 or a 10 that most have done so far, the assessment numbers make no sense. I can't believe how strong people feel about this forgettable fluff (or even disturbing to write about it). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs his role as Clairedycat convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, who is often written in b * ch roles, does not disappoint when her character gets her due. You can also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, though his role is helping. <br /> <br /> You can probably miss this if you are an adult. But if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie to her ... and be prepared not to hate it (you can even enjoy it).
