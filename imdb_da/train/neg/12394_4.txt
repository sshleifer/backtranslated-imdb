When I got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar films .. I saw with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad in itself. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap tensions it's not that bad. I'll probably never see this movie again. In a nutshell, it's the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night at a local television station that will only take some time or you would watch it on a Sunday afternoon at a local TV station trying to take a little time. Despite the bad plays, clich√© lines and sub par camera work. I didn't want to turn off the movie and pretend it never got into my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many films. This one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
