This time we get a psycho-toy man named "Joe Petto" (get it?), Which produces live, evil toys that kill people. He goes after the family, having the trouble of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "Pino" (again, get it?) Cared to live. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (and hopefully [probably] last) in this series is this and the previous one, like soft core porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It's a bit like a low-rent hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home videos. Probably in 2000, they began to make a sixth chapter of the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can only hope that this will be ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star out of **** <br /> <br />
