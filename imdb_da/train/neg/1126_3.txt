I rented this thinking, it could be interesting, and it might have been an interesting story, except it was told in such an uninteresting way. Hard to follow, strange editing, irreconcilable story, characters all mumble a terribly dull time wastage. I just couldn't get into it and didn't care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save this movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I would skip it. 3/10 and it's generous.
