This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams fits into the part that a rhino would fit into a tutu, though his performance was still pitiful. Kurt Russell was more credible but still horrible. The plot left much to be desired, and the rest of the play was also terrible. The only thing this movie was going to be was the trailer, which sucked me in to waste 90 minutes of my life, which could have been better spent licking the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy, you don't.
