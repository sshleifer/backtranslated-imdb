The movie itself is so pathetic. It portrayed deaf people as cynical to hear people. It is true that some deaf people are cautious about hearing people, but they are not necessarily angry as if Marlee Matlin's character were in the whole story. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dances that Matlin did. All in all, the film itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I want to believe it's an insomnia movie. If I have a problem sleeping, I can just pop in children of a smaller god and see. It'll put me to bed. <br /> <br /> Remember, there is a deaf guy talking.
