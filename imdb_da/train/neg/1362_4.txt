Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very non-sympathetic movie at all. <br /> <br /> The film shows promise that Ustinov is released from prison to confuse. He convinces Robert Morley to go away so he can take on his identity and start chopping computers at a very fancy company run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for movies. <br /> <br /> Morley just sounds like he did in 1938's "Marie Antoinette." Maybe he should return to that genre. <br /> <br /> At best, this movie is ridiculous. It's hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith completely changed his ways and gave a crunching Oscar performance in "Miss Jean Brodie's Prime Minister." <br /> <br /> Wife. Smith is made here to be a seemingly stupid red head, but at the end of the film, she is the brain in outwit. Too bad the writing did not go with her.
