Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, is stranded on a snowy mountain and faces the difficult decision to eat their dead headed meat to survive. Sounds familiar to anyone? I refer to "Alive" from 1993. The only major difference here is, of course, that a large, white, drunk scarecrow of a Yeti pops up a couple of times to pull the dead out. I think people taste better than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely false. It would either have exploded in the air, exploded as it hit the ground or was wiped out. The people wouldn't have survived, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They survived and they are cold. It may be a good idea to exploit some of the burning wastes nearby so as not to freeze to death. Fire is hot as it is ... WTF: The pilot has frost all over his face while he is alive and talking, but strangely, no one else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the boys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts of the plane on the fire around them. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They find coats and hoodies, and yet in the Himalayan cold they fail to use the hoods! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They are staring at a pile of sticks as I repeat that there are pieces of the plane, LIMITING BURNING. <br /> <br /> Stupid: Himalayas are infamous for their storms. It would be common sense for them to collect the sugars to strengthen their structure rather than sit outside the bickering. There are many pine trees around whose branches make excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: Doubt a dead arm like a splinter. <br /> <br /> WTF: If one guy knows so much about Himalayan sleepers, bears and leopards, why doesn't he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: When trying to catch wild animals, mindless conversation near the trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen body with a glass screen? <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti, while the other two stood defenseless. The Yeti ripped the guy's heart and stubby girl's head, and the band did nothing. There is love. So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever .... or we believe. Mwuhahahaa! The story goes on to more idioci, but it usually happens in the last 15 minutes. Nice thinking with the spear and the chain, although it is some ingenuity (with the magically emerging chain) that they lacked at the start of the movie, as they couldn't even make fire despite being around them. br /> <br /> As is typical of Sci-Fi Originals, the beloved couple kisses at the end, just as nothing terrible has just happened to them (not to mention that they ate human flesh and have not brushed their teeth in several days). <br /> <br /> The end, however, is a quote lamb.
