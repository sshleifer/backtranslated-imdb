I have never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime" I love to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I love the city and its urban areas. I'm expected to be touched by this movie, wanting to jump into an airplane and fly there right away, but watch and see I'm sorry about the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other, and it just doesn't work fine. Perhaps this reflects a hallmark of the city where it is said to have thousands of people living on their own. Can't find love in New York?
