Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can't stand Ben anymore. How this man is allowed to make movies is still beyond me. I can't understand how this happens if I did work the way he was acting in a movie I'd be fired and I own the company ..... I would have to shoot myself. GOD! This movie was just a regular, steaming, smelly pile of POOs to be vaporized if possible. Something else I have to say about the 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is needed.
