Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I entered the movie (by an Indian multiplex) with great hopes, especially after the smooth promos. Unfortunately, as HULCHUL before that, this movie was a huge disappointment. As others have commented, the film's performance, which was already old, was first and foremost stretched on and without development or further layering. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I had seen this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is at best average, and John Abraham shouldn't try to make comedy again. The comedy aspects of the film's superiors were quite week. I only remember giggling as twice the whole movie. Absolutely no sidesplitting stomach laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had a couple of his expected classic moments, but generally, because his role and character did not get much room to grow, he did not much influence in this movie. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who only looks at the movie, was fun to watch while on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY respectively. Otherwise, it's better to just pass this movie.
