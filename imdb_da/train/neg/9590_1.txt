The film is based on a true 1950s novel. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "Spades City" and "Mr Love and Justice". I've read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, maybe an experiment that didn't come out. But McInne's work is highly recognized; and rightly so. This musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - to see that the fruits of one's mind are transformed into an excellent, poorly-acted, soporific one-dimensional excuse for a movie that says it captures the spirit of the 1950s in London and does nothing of the kind of. <br /> <br /> Thank you Colin McInnes was not alive to see it.
