What terrible to write and act. No personality. What can't you do a good movie with a single character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with self-dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this kid goes on a trip to see his father. The child, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies midway. So the baby crashes into a lake and survives. Then he runs around and survives in the desert until he is rescued. <br /> <br /> During that time, he fights a bear twice. The first time he fights it in the lake. The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and jumps the bear. Two shots of false blood leaking out of the bear's chest reminded me of Monty Python's "The Holy Grail." <br /> <br /> Also, the child decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> gag.
