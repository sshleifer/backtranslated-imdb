I really hate this show! I had seen an episode and I knew that this show is really terrible. The story lines are both poorly written and executed, and the jokes are really bad ... I mean, it's just a sh + ty rip-off of Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, 'about an unpleasant boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog; a boyfriend and a smart, super busy mother ... like oh-my-flippin 'God! Their father is a mother-f ** kin 'crazy home maker, it's not that gay! If my father is the home-maker, I would personally die! For shame it's ... Really I wanted to. I have nothing else to do with this ... this travesty but only 3 words; count them 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · Stupid and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say people are sure to make my list of worst animated series EV-ER! If I had one there.
