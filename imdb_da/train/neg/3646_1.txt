Oh ... my ... God ... it's undoubtedly the absolute cheesest movie I've ever seen. The action is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole movie just doesn't make sense. Pair this with mediocre directors, really weird scenes (like the one where the baby reaches the gorge and mysteriously falls into), and thoroughly immense dialogue ("Look!" "Musta jaws his pants!") And you get a complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars. But it's part of the movie's charm. Sit down and watch it with a couple of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's just so bad!
