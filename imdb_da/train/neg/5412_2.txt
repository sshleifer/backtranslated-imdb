Pyare Mohan can certainly be included in the blacklist of one of the worst ever films produced by humanity. The film, one of the many handicapped people's flicks that emerged from the phenomenal success of Black, makes a mockery of disabled brotherhood. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are only caricatures of the disabled. While Black highlighted a woman's and emotional's feelings and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperate-like monkeys who have no trouble being disabled and bash up half the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, who made a promising start with Saathiya, unfortunately quickly loses his balls in the Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just beautiful damsels in distress that have nightmares in Thialnd with no one to save them - except the aforementioned desperads. Boman Irani, as the crown Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
