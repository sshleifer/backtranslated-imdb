The film did what it should do: show how a young girl handles poverty and grows in her maturity. But for most of us, this topic has been explored sufficiently and in most cases with more sophistication than done here. The movie fixed on the breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If this were on TV, I would have switched to the latest news on the Starr report. It was so boring I found this movie.
