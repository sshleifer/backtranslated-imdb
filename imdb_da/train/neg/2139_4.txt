I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a badly made movie with too few laughs. The policy is spot on, it will offend hell out of the Republicans, but that's what it's designed to do. That alone gives me reason to cluster. <br /> <br /> The problem is, it seems that it was made in a REAL hurry (like in a week). And it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer who seems to be completely out of the subject. Turiqistan is, of course, Iraq or Afghanistan or another number of countries that the United States has had since the 50s. The mood is a bit dark (amputary dances with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane Corporation), but it is on the field, especially with the companies that deposit on the reconstruction ("little democracy"!) But just as a lot of satire criticizes the US, it seems terribly heavy handed out and worked. I suppose it is in conflict with so much bs propaganda, so it must bludge people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer more of a button, blink-approach - a little bit of refinement. But it's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can see it again, maybe I've missed something. I hope "W" is more on the field.
