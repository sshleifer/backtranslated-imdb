Mmm, doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit retain on top. Tag and pray. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. Eat it, you !!! Hold the shovel in the throat until your face turns green with nausea. You've just had the Ally McBeal experience. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this show in the winter of '98 and was immediately connected. Just like the stack of pancakes I hit myself on it. But the pleasure quickly broke down because the Ally McBeal character (whom we look to be sweet and endearing at first glance) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure, itchy complaint you've ever met. (Call me to a feminist, but I prefer my female driver to have a spine.) The gags and gimmicks of the show are also hackneyed, Vonda Shepherd's music (which is really pushed in your face) becomes lattice and the incessant character Changes and Rewrites make the show for an amazing soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this show in small doses and quit as soon as it gets annoying (and it will). I made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment was completely sour. It was good while it lasted, but as a crazy, neurotic ex-boyfriend it just became ugly after it had overstayed its welcome. <br /> <br /> And next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy as the fruit cup. It will be much better with you.
