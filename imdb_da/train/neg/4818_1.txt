I was about 7 when this DIRE MONSTROSITY of a movie was released. In the UK, it was announced on television in the summer of 1977 this week, as if it were an incredible movie. It was actually the first movie I ever saw in a movie theater and I was beaten in the years to come. The following week I was invited to go and see the new movie "Star Wars" and I declined. So far I have never seen it in protest against seeing Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7 I could tell that I was looking at garbage. It's just so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Rambling nonsense that should never have made it a movie theater. However, I was amused to read all these years later that the director never rectified himself again, as well as I am concerned. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
