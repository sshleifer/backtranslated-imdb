Disney goes to the well one too many times, as anyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel blatantly ripped off. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric are planning to introduce her to King Triton. The celebration is quickly overthrown by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to get the king's trident. Stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric are building a wall around the ocean, while Melody is growing up and wondering why she can't get in there. <br /> <br /> Terrible and terrible is what describes this directly to the video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you see seemed to have come just like other Disney movies. I think Disney can only plagiarize himself! Don't tell me that the penguin and walrus don't remind you of another duo from LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They terribly under it played it! The climate between Morgana and ALL seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give anything away, but for 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly crowded and too much to handle. A shame for Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better back to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare the rest of the other successors Disney will drown you later.
