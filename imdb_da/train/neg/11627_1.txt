I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The witnesses would not have worked for gilligan's island. If this had been done in series, there would have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace his furnace, for only having Adolf suggest the kind that pitches 50 ?? Another post compared this show to I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedies and bizarre situations, and this mess was simply very badly done and an insult to my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage the Nazis did to England and the number of people they killed, I would think of the very concept of a comedy, whether Hitler is contradictory, and most normal people would have killed this concept within Some episodes were produced.
