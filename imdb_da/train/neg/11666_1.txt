As carefully as I can, I sincerely believe that this movie is a waste of time. I didn't find it the "hot, emotionally satisfying" movie others did. I found it boring, with music that distracted from the movie. The story was thin, the characters covered and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I have to write more about this movie so I make the 10 line minimum. There really is no more to say and shortness is important, but IMDb has its minimum standards, so here goes. <br /> <br /> Young avid kid finds emerging talent, seeking time with aging, embarrassed mentor despite father's cartoonish homophobia. Aging, bitter mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. conflict arises. Although I don't think this is a spoiler, I have added the warning if someone feels that this much information is too much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I just found the movie boring and pretentious. Waste of my time. I honestly do not understand what is a little quirky that seems to be, mainly on this site, about the transcendent quality of this movie. I think it's really worth avoiding. But as Dennis Miller used to say, "Maybe I'm wrong."
