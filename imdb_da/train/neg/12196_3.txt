The actors did a really good job - especially the mother. But when the film was advanced, I found out that I saw it more to their action and not because I used the least for the people. And at times I felt annoyed by the irresponsible and hands-free approach to parents who appeared again and again. The daughter is a 17-year-old flat shank whose greatest ambition in life is bedding famous men and becomes a dancing nip hood (complete with lots of "booty shaking"). The son is a low self-esteem guy who seems very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much so that he throws a drug party late in the movie. The husband and wife are both bored, but rather than putting energy into their outdated relationship, one would rather seek new partners (though wife chooses badly as the man she "throws herself on" happens to be gay --- OOPS! ). I just felt that ALL the characters were needed to grow up and struggled to care for such superficial jerks. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the complete banality and hollowness of the capitalist system. But since these signs are not typical of the average Western family, it seems unfortunate.
