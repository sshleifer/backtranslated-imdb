This movie on paper looked as though it might be good after watching, though I realized this movie was horrible !! The reason has no meaning, and I think I counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes, each making the movie more annoyingly boring and ridiculous. I saw this late night pitch no noise at all just to add to SCARINESS of it, but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera, I mean being serious !! This movie summarizes everything that is not good with this type of movie. To be honest ill say no more, but look at your own risk this movie is just finished with waste, enjoy !!
