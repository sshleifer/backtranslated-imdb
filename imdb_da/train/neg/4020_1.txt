I will never be a member of any club that wanted me, <br /> <br /> especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mother / stripper who is attacked by a <br /> female vampire and left for death. She starts fetching the blood and meets with John Savage and looks as if he is <br /> <br /> wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire <br /> <br /> family consisting of a British vamp, the blonde vamp <br /> < br /> attacked Starr and a green-haired midget (I do not do this <br /> <br />) <br /> <br /> The family will not have Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <<br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his screen time displaying more facial tics than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bender, and he reads all his lines as <br /> < br /> he makes a Farrelly Brothers movie. Andreeff is trying to make the most of a badly written role, but writer / director Ruben goes <br /> <br /> to all the vampire clich√©s that Starr eats his son's pet hammer <br /> <br /> and buys a lot of raw meat to fight the urge for blood. The child is also turned around a lot, for those who seem to look at violence against children are really entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is extra gory, but not in a wild, over the top way as "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue." Here are gore rough and never justified, it just happens. <br /> <br /> It's just in the budget. Most of the R classification goes to Andreeffs <br /> <br /> colleagues who are implemented through embracing strip routines in <br /> <br /> the background for conversation scenes. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire fangs! All the vampires here have to prey on eating. <br /> <br /> Nifty idea unless you've already seen George Romero's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even in 77 minutes, and when you throw Ruben's attempts at <br /> <br /> arty direction (crooked frame, blurry scenes), this is a dull, boring and dirty ride. Leave this club and take a bath <br /> <br /> you will need it. <br /> <br /> This is characterized (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual <br /> <br /> violence, strong behavior, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual <br /> < br /> references, drug abuse and adult situations. <br /> <br />
