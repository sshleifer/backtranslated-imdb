I think I've seen this kind of thing before: college students who aren't aware that they're pretty boring, all the time, complaining that their lives are sucking. <br /> <br /> This movie is very much derived from The Big Chill and reality bites from what I can do about it: they have virtually the same plot. <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this string party, it was the music. Thats it. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but then again I never expected anything less. This movie was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be seen with blindfold in tow. Now for the verdict: It's a 1 out of 10.
