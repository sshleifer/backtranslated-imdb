Usually I know after the first minute of the movie if I want to hate it or love it ... but now I was wrong. The start was fantastic; "This is based on a true story" and blah blah stuff was fun. After, the drawings and the description of the boys' lives with pictures made me believe I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Seeing the hilarious fake look of Toronto was cool. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> It was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then looked like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me, I don't understand English Canadian humor (it's possible, English Canadians don't always understand Quebecoi's humor), but hey ... there were enough things for a short movie, * nothing * more. Maybe it could be of importance to the title? Yet almost everything was filling, and very few things were even close to fun in my opinion. In fact, "making of" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; Therefore, I rented the film, was interested in the "annoying people vanishing" thing. But I still didn't know that the whole universe would disappear, and even a point on the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an English Canadian, you seem to appreciate the local humor, given the surprising number of people who gave this movie a 8. Otherwise, you just think two times before you lose your precious time ...
