Saying this movie stinks would be insulting to skunks. As the other commentary says, this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially incredibly insulting to gays). It's awful - and not in a "so bad, it's fun" - it's just awful. No, I have to say it: It stinks! (sorry skunks). From opening credits to end titles, there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes to. "The plot" is incoherent, the characterization is non-existent, the play is of the upper curl "look at me, I am fun!" school and then it goes on. The set pieces are cleverly set up (if at all) and are poorly done, it is just awful on every front - except for the music, I don't remember the music stinking (except the songs). <br /> <br /> To be fair to decision makers, they put their cards on the table quite quickly: the opening points include the title "Also with the lead role of Ertha Kitt as the voice of the Betty meteor" (since that meteor never turns out to say anything else) than make occasional exciting noise, they may well have lifted Mrs Kitts' contribution from one of her records), and the second line of the film runs like: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus." Uranus - "Your Anus" geddit? geddit? what? what ?? Your Anus? The mood is really cheap. It says strange things about the "comedies" during that period because it was perfectly allowed for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead on the street but not say "sh * t" loudly. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel ripped off.
