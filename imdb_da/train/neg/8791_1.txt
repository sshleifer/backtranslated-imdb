Be warned! <br /> <br /> This is bad that other crap won't even expect to be in company because it's under them! Okay, got it out of the way, let me say something more substantive. <br /> <br /> I have seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking that it was a fresh take on the material based on a highly honored wuxia tome of a novel due to the director's new reputation, Wong Kar Wai. Well, in spite of everything, WKW has failed to customize the novel on the screen according to many wuxia fans; For the most part, it is just shots of water, sponge balls, scooters, etc. I couldn't go through most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr Wong's film another shot after hearing many roses, especially from Cannes. I was fascinated by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movie. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I was knocked out to waste my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothing. Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern metropolis, blah, blah, blah. That's fine if the director has a point of saying something about why these things happen and tell them. But no, he only shows what is. Faye Wong's play is very typical of Hong Kong's style: enchanted resignation, deer in the headlamp at eye expressions, trying to be sweet and greedy kind of acting; The rest of the throw is just as uninspired. I think the word, Author, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which must be applauded, but not one that does not have but mastered the art of film-historical narrative, which is what Mr. Wong has been in the last 17 years!
