A young American woman visits her Irish roots and awaits a druid witch who is out to possess her. It sounds exciting, but after an interesting start I was lost and spent most of the time wondering where it went. The movie seems to be dithering in two directions - do we look at the Irish-American woman's traveler who is struggling for her alcohol problem, or do we see a straightforward fright of a vicious witch returning from the past? The director can't seem to decide. The two do not seem to gels and in the end you get nowhere. This could be so much better done, and the story seemed to pull towards the end. This was most boring and disappointing.
