** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher movies that do not make sense when a killer runs around dressed in a black cape and wearing what looks like a Peter Lorre rubber mask cover. It was said early in the film, almost the very first scene, that young Beth Morgan was in rehabilitation due to heavy drug use, after her boyfriend was murdered at Tennyson Collage a year ago. It has also been revealed that the FBI Agent Sacker's (Jeff Conaway) obsessed with catching the killer was also killed in Tennyson around the same time. When the movie "Do You Wanna Know A Secret" is over, is it never explained what the two kittens back in Connecticute have to do with the slaughter in Florida of half a dozen collage students a year later? Second, the killer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, had the same stupid Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> At spring break in the Sunshine State, the six students spend their vacation at a beach house, and before you know it, they start to knock off one at a time. Beginning with computer geek Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, even killed over to the city with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student, including police minister Gavin, Jack McGee, who is being cut open. <br /> <br /> Finally, the masked killer saves Beth at this strange ceremony in a deserted church, in what looks like the Florida Everglades. He finally reveals who he is and what he intends to do, which makes so much sense as the movie does, none. Trying to scare the audience that the whole movie does is confusing and confusing with a number of non-compelling slasher scenes. The most effective who have sacrificed Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survives at least three attempts at his life and joins with Agent Sacker, the hero of the movie. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a vicious cut on the foot of a large glass chip that nearly cut it half and paralyzed him, but later he was miraculously restored after being arrested for a murder he did not commit. In fact, he got it out twice with the killer with him, not so much as having a tiny lukewarm in turn! Nor did it make sense why Oz and Beth went alone and managed to catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cell phone that Oz had instead? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend losing her head in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very convincing as well as the two girls at the beach house. Those with Beth Oz end up being the victims of death and then somehow disappear from sight! for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed or if it was a kind of hallucination on Oz or the local police. Until the final scene, where they appeared in the church. <br /> <br /> We also get an insight into a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and acting unpleasant, trying to get it on with Hank, as Beth enters without Hank, and Tina even notices her. It seemed to have bored Beth even more when her boyfriend was murdered at the start of the movie!
