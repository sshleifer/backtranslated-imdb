Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife so young and beautiful. To this end, he breaks drugs during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they have died so he can steal their bodies. I'm not quite sure what he's doing with the bodies. I can't remember it ever being fully explained. All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects it into his wife. (I just want to guess it's spinal fluid. Spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s.) You can basically guess the rest from here. <br /> <br /> There are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I only write about two) of the issues I have with this movie. One is the way Bela is used. Sure, he does a decent enough job in his own overactive kind of way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). But to make him hide behind a chain or get him to crawl into the bedroom reporter's bedroom to do something, it's just silly. Also, why has he beaten and / or killed every henchman he has? Is it getting him to look hurt? Well, a person who is kidnapping comatose brides does not really have to be done to see more evil. The other problem I have is the idea of ​​drinking grapes. Why brides? Wouldn't a woman under 20 do? Seeing Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, I was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in I still know what you did last summer. In each case, there seems to be an easier way to reach your goal than to use a seemingly impossible plan that depends too much on circumstances beyond your control. (BTW, an alternative title to this movie is The Case of the Missing Brides. I guess it partly explains the need for 'brides'.)
