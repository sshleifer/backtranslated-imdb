This movie is really awful. Terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are so terrible. The action was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It's about a crocodile attacking tourists as they are filming a documentary about "blood surfing". Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks, but it gets terribly wrong when a 31 foot crocodile breaks holiday there. The sharks do not look right. The crocodile is even worse and it becomes even more pathetic when they run away from the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it. The deaths are fake and the pirates are just about to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A pointless, horrible movie that's not worth watching !!
