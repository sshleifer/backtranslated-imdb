Ugh! Where to start? First, Campbell Scott's non-stop anxiety becomes a real ending after some time as he internalises his growing anxiety, curiosity and anger. Only we don't care! These characters, as presented by the author and director, are quite unlikely and the key is in it. They have not given us anything to care for us if they are terrible and whether they are still in love with one another. When Scott quietly says to his wife, "I could kill you" before their three daughters at the dining table, after the shock of his selfish bad timing had turned off, I almost wished he had - and then did the same to the stealth, Wisecracking apparently Denis Leary before being pulled out of the looney bin. A complete waste of time and perhaps - only perhaps - resources.
