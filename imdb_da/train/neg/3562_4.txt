"Indian Burial Site": If the three words appear anywhere in a property listing, look for another neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a grandchildren moving into a Maine house next to a pet cemetery - and after a l-o-o-ng-hike, an ancient Indian burial ground. Seems the Indian soil can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead - if you don't mind having a raving wild animal for a pet. It can do the same for dead people - if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house. Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speed big rigs, a well-meaning if somewhat weak) old neighbor and a child who really doesn't get enough supervision and I think you can find out what's going on from there - one Extraordinarily illogical root that greatly enhances justice There are inferior Stephen King adjustments (such as "Maximum Overdrive" which King also instructed). But there is also much better (such as "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
