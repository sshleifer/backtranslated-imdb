Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start to a serious relationship leads her to a significantly younger man and a subsequenet falls out with 2 long best friends. <br /> <br /> Seeing a gigolo / gold digger in the sincere young man, "girl-friends" who is about to end this "stupid relationship" goes beyond the call of duty to "help" their friend (who is apparently blind by this gigolo tricky game ". <br /> <br /> A short sequence of situations is quite ridiculous. Far retrieval no longer covers it. Without these incredible scenes, hope may have been Instead, all viewers are left with is an involuntary shaking of head - these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer to have high expectations for this movie, most (like me ) will be very disappointed, scale from 1 to 10, this ranks a weak 4 with me.There is much better material out there is not worth your time.
