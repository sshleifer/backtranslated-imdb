Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was uneven ... it gave no background on its life, no historical context and nothing about his great writings (except for a brief, referring reference to "The Cost of Discipleship" of a colleague at the beginning of the movie.) Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the states) and chill out with his friends before deciding to go back to Germany. Apparently showing his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands up for his faith. Instead of emphasizing it, we get a very badly acted romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether or not it actually took place, it should not have been a big part of the movie. Now I'm still waiting for the dramatic part or story that explains what his writings were about ... or NUTRITION to get us to know a little bit of this man's greatness. drum roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of movie that gives "Christian Films" a bad name. All they had to do was create a structure for the movie to follow with a little background ... even some voice-overs or backlinks to him preaching from his works ... some tale of who he was and where he was. But no ... that's what we got. Hardly fitting to the faith.
