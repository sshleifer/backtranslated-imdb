Two films are useful for scaring people to God, this and the 'Event Horizon'. One has a significant and exciting message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious film can get. By the way, Paul Anderson went on to the damned Resident Evil movies, he really had something going. <br /> <br /> Thieves in the night are hampered by many obvious independent film attributes (plays, narration, dialogue and persuasion) and it is obvious what the film's intentions are from the start. The Christian film industry has not learned from the errors so we are stuck with the Omega code, the left behind and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they are so worried about selling their message: "Get Saved, People!" that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a bible. In general, I can't believe that I write so much about a movie that is ineffective. Jump it all the way out and go back to Sam Neil, who runs into the eye. 1 out of 5.
