This film is an embarrassment to film making. I can't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not fun. Not only was the script terrible, but the casting people had to be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond that ...% 99 of the rest of the cast ... ouch. Almost everybody else ... wow it's hard to even ... wow. Here's the number one rule of comedy "Don't try to be fun". There are many very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this movie. Canadian nepotism and casting directors help maintain poor filmmaking in Canada. I am aware that this is technically an "American" movie, but look at the director, the actors, the location, etc. I just saw this at Bravo - they were ashamed that they bought the rights to show this movie. Again, there are many great movies out there that can't smell and they show this crap.
