This is a pretty bad movie. The reason is sentimental mush. I suppose the production values ​​are OK, decent photography, discreet direction and all that. Mark Hamill was horrible. I have never cared much for him and this film validates that view. It's no wonder he never really had any kind of career apart from his "Star Wars" movie. I just want to say "Buh-bye, Mark" as he sinks into well-deserved obscurity. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts completely stole the show. She showed charm, beauty and acting all in one performance. I remember seeing her in "Texasville" recently and taking note of her beauty. It is interesting to see her from ten years earlier. Anyway, unless you are interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie that screams to the hills.
