I have a horrible pan-and-scan videotape of "Boom!", And I will see it throughout its widescreen glory. So I voted "1" and hope you will too. Together we can pull this movie down into the mines of cinematic dross and hope that someone will see a chance for BIG MONEY to release "Boom!" in the Director's Cut Extended Version. The movie is one of my favorite favorites? You just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say to yourself, "Yes, I think you can fool some of the people for a long time." Manufacturers are considering the DVD release of "Boom!" must note that everywhere has been shown, there have been sellout crowds in the theaters. But it's not been up to Frostbite Falls yet.
