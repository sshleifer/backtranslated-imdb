I have grown up and leaned over the interwoven stories of wrinkled in time chronicles. My dream was that someday a writer would come across their child in a big couch that read A Winkle in Time and would think what great movie this would do. Unfortunately, the manuscript writer, changed characters, slammed in lame humor and everything failed to destroy the plot. I know it's a difficult task to change a well-known novel into a movie. But why can't you be true to the book? Why change the way characters think and act? For those of you who haven't read the book, pick it up, find a soft sofa, and let your imagination run wild.
