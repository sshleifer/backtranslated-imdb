This movie is something like a sequel to the "White Zombie" as it is made by the same man (Halperin) and has zombies. However, Halperin, his George A. Romero, does not live with this. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and a search to destroy the source of his power so that the zombies can be sent free. Also a love interest for the evil man. <br /> <br /> Where this movie really stands out is in the picture. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice, and the zombie looks very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we don't really see much of the zombies in action, and the love story seems to play too much for a horror movie (although this has a valid plot cause later). <br /> <br /> I would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attacking helpless townspeople, but this movie just didn't deliver. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect, but misleading as he is never in the movie ... why not recreate it with the new actor? S eyes? Overall, a movie that could be a big one with a small script could work again and one day could be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post war period). Heck, if they can correct "The Hills Have Eyes" then this movie has hope.
