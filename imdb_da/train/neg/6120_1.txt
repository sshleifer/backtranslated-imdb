There are three kinds of bad movies - the cheap, the boring and the tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> boring movies are just good, boring - if you don't go fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> tasteless movies actually have their defenders; But the fact is that they are masturbating aids for very sick people. Only the cheap bad movies are really fun, because the filmmakers wanted to make their movies so desperate they were over their abilities and available resources. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is just naturally boring and tasteless; Fortunately, fate and lack of funds and skills redeem her by making her look cheap too. This movie is hilarious and it may well be the last really fun-bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw the first thing in a theater, God must forgive me; I laughed so hard that I rolled out of my seat and saw most of the rest of the audience. Clearly, Derek and her husband's promoter, thought of this movie as partial, a satire; unfortunately, derek clearly lacked some of the necessary resources to pull it away; Consequently, the "satirical" element emerges as any schoolgirl's impression of some homosexual youth's impression of Frank Gorshin's impression of the knight's knight and attempting to pretend to be robin - it does not fly over his head, it has no idea where any human head can be. On the other hand, there are probably some serious moments in this movie - it has to be an action movie, remember - it's such an amazing cheesy one wonders if anyone sprayed spoiled milk in his eye. <br /> <br /> as for Derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - I can't imagine a less erotic nudity photographic screen, she's so weird to see with the wide shoulders, I can 'I can't imagine what anyone has ever seen in her. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - as it is - yes it is not; Derek is chasing Africa, and God alone knows why. then her father Harris is acting in some maniacal puppet show, and of course there is hunk'o'Tarzan, who seems to have wondered from advertising without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he has not seen one script - apparently no one has. <br /> <br /> negligible camera work, shoddy editing - if it wasn't for 3-way with the chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real hoot.
