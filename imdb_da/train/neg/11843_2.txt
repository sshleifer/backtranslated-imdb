Just because an event really happened, doesn't mean it will make a good play / movie. Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events that occurred on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The author was more concerned with creating a bizarre fate of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to be inhabited. The most important moments of history seem impossible; For example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer and believes in him being Chaplin. Basing a key element in a story that someone has the wrong hat is tired and constructed. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It hardly means who's shot, who's killed, who's guilty, and who's innocent. There is not a strong character to cheer for. As a result, the conflicts are difficult to care for and the final result is random.
