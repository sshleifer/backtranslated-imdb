Murder occurs in a desert town in Texas. Who is responsible? Small news of mystery and racial tension (the latter really doesn't fit), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate gore and nudity, which are two conventional elements to these movies. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from Friday the 13th part 3 infamy) stars like the bratty quasi-detective teen. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for violence and gore, nudity and some language.
