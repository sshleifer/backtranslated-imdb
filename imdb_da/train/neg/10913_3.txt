Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a policeman who is his lifelong dream. But his luck changes when he has a car crash (a very bad one) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild him. After this moment, he begins to have wild behavior unconsciously and becomes a best policeman you could ever be. At that time, he understands the changes, and his animal instinct begins to take over his human side. In the meantime, he finds a lovely girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, meaning he must control himself and behave civilized. I'm not a big fun by Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first movie I've seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser. (See his role in Ally Mcbeal, quite funny indeed). There are some good parts in the movie that he flirts with the goat. In such movies, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it's not taken too seriously. But very sorry to see such movies doing really well in the ticket office. The animal is not the worst movie I've seen to date, but fails to get more than *.
