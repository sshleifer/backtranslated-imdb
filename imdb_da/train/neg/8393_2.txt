John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue, as players all saw better days in better movies, came together for this Grade G horror movie about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. For Carradine, it was in them For the past two decades of his career, he was all about the theory that it was better to continue working no matter what you did and get those payslips into. With his grandly responsive voice, Carradine was always in great demand for horror images and at least the man did not discriminate what he thought. <br /> <br /> He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion, which movie director John Ireland has hired for his latest low-budget slasher movie. It even has a cemetery, but with a missing resident. Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star, and Carole Wells is the young ingenuity. In the last twenty minutes or so, most of the cast are dead who have not died already. The script is so disjointed, I'm still trying to figure out the point. I don't want to waste more gray material on it.
