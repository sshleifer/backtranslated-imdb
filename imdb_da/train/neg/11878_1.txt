Really, when it comes to that, this movie is just not fun. Josh Kornbluth is an antithesis of fun, and yet he thinks he's fun. The plot of sending the 17 letters was fine at first, until Josh's "look at me, I'm wacky" approach began to regret every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been the least fun thing I've ever been to, and it says a bit, as it has fierce competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And for the incredible overuse of Pixie's "Debaser" I have only one thing to say: What did Pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this? What did anyone do to Josh Kornbluth to make him write / direct / produce / star in such a horrible movie?
