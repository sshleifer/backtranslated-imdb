I felt the movie was dry ... very disappointing, no plot .. wait waiting for something to happen and nothing dried like a bone .. a waste of money. One of Robins Williams' worst movies. If you do not believe me wait a few months it will be out on DVD because it seems to be a pattern for movies that do not perform well in the theaters are like rentals before the year is over ... This is a you do not want to see or say why did i spend my money on it! Plus for being such a new movie, there were only 8 people in it to watch it .... It was on a Friday night at 9:50. I also felt it needed a little more excitement or something to keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were also very low, you couldn't hear what they were saying.
