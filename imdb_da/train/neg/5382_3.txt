Absolutely product of young mind, this piece can very well appeal to the 20th century audience, who are still trying to find their place in the world while obsessing over every neurosis. However, I cannot imagine that the large amount of narcissistic umbilical stirring, trite humor or banal subject would be particularly engaging for anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheries that the filmmakers naturally only disdain are hyped up to such absurd cartoons for cartoon effect that they are not relational in any real way. <br /> <br /> But one has to give some points to the filmmakers, who of course grew up in the video generation and use every imaginable editing trick in the book to spruce up an otherwise non-existing plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First watch the festival darlings. Secondly, not everyone's bill deserves of their everyday life, even though we live in the age of youtube, big-screen processing. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their films, and if other 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then the better. But I couldn't help but think at the end of this movie, how this latest generation, right now, will age in the real world, presenting so many challenges and complications. At an age where every child is constantly reassured about how special they are and that they all deserve their 15-minute exposure, endurance and the ability to deal with adversity do not appear to be the strong point of this generation.
