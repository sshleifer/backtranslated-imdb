Beautifully photographed and ably acted, in general, but the writing is very slip-resistant. There are scenes of such infidelity that there is no joy in seeing. For example, the fact that the young lover has a twin brother is so enchanted that I moaned loudly. And the "emotional bulb" also works gimmicky. <br /> <br /> I don't know. If you have a couple of glasses of wine and want to relax with something beautiful to look at with a few slimming comic scenes, this is a great movie. No major effort from that part of the viewer is required. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this.
