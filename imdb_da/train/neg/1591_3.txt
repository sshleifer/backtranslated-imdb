After seeing many of the "Next Action Star", the TV set TiVo worked with this gawd-horrible tripe for me. For some bizarre reason - and I only blame myself - I saw it all and hoped there would be * something * unique in the whole movie. After so much hype about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action flicks, he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy. At first, the only redeeming value of the whole movie was Billy Zane, and even he couldn't lift the rubbing shit that was out of crapper. That said, Zane's performance drops around 2 / 3rds through, as he doesn't even know what to do other than to be complacent. <br /> <br /> But can't blame him here. Scripture, frankly, sucked. Let's take ideas from "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Midnight Run" and any bad movie you can think of and simply rehash it. And who is the brilliant idea that it was to have two hunting sequences in a ROW? Sean Carrigan, "The Hour Man" of "The Next Action Star" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of casting directors mention throughout the series. A one-note johnny, Sean plays the stupid great jock very well, but struggles to accept the weight of the movie. Honestly, we never quite care about whether he lives or dies about halfway through when Carrigan fails to give a reason to the audience to resemble him. His stupid-luck routine gets old, as there really is nothing about the character to run for. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wood-shaped Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Has Howard Fine really told her not to be a Terminator for the first half of the movie? I do not think. I expect her to quote Arnie. Her character "performance" can only be compared to the dramatic depth of "Freddy Got Fingered", but not as well-developed. The camera loves her in dark, shady limousines, but in today's hard light, her demeanor sucks all the energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute part than Corinne showed on any part of her screen time. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Sean has the robust look to give a good lead in an ensemble cast, but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a task for him. "Next Action Star" colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with a more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to tell Jeff Welch's lame script. Someone should take Welch's iMac away from him before he hurts or others. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outclassed and far out of reach, even for complete shlock like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
