This is one of those movies that has a great video box, but has cable camra work and unknown actors talking with poor dialogue. It's so dark when the killing happens, you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand. The only star in this is WCW's Vanessa Sanchez (Tyger in WCW before it folds) and she is a good actress. I like low budget movies especialy those who have bugs because they are fun to watch, but Severed unfourtunatly is not one of them. This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and cut heads, but it's not a blockbuster, but if you need something new to watch then hire Severed.
