The only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrongly with their message. SPOILER: They feed a deer for a year and kill it to eat their food after killing their mother and initially pontificating on taking responsibility for their actions. They blame bears and deer for "misbehaving" by eating while not taking any responsibility for using appropriate locks and fences or even learning to shoot rather than twice maiming animals and letting them dwell.
