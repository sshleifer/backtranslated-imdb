Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and a bad direction. This is the case with "The Mummy's Tomb." The script is remaining ideas from older, better Universal horror flicks like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." The direction is thin and outdated. The action is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tylers in "The Mummy's Hand," and the producers are bad enough to add Christy Cabannes recordings much better prequel and show the weakness of their own movie! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this movie was, and essentially reminded it from scratch two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better script and better director. The result was probably the best movie in their four movie "Mummy" cycle, but not everywhere as good as Karl Freund's 1932 original. <br /> <br /> Cabannes recordings make this movie a 3. The "new" thing is a 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably happy to see their characters come out so they would not look like drunk like this anymore!
