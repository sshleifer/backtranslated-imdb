Oh yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the top. It has been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep at work, unfortunately the game did half. Don't make me wrong, it's fun, but you get tired of mashing buttons. As for plot collection, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Turn that guy into the end and win! Eh, who's playing it in itself anyway?
