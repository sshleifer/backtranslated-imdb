The one who made this nonsense missed the point. Jane is a silly cartoon to titrate without being fun. <br /> <br /> But this giant mess is trying to be fun and exciting, but it's just a shambles. There is not a decent performance in it .. although the normally reliable Jasper Carrott is painfully unfunny. <br /> <br /> The American bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon. <br /> <br /> Maud Adams is trying as a villianess, but she is a little long in the tooth for this type of thing. All these things would do nothing if the girl was sexy or fun or equal. She's not. Kirsten Holmes fell into obscurity after this and so much the better. <br /> <br /> I've washed more entertaining things than this down the toilet. Avoid
