86 wasted minutes in my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to see it, and I have to say that I don't even fall asleep at the cinema. I have never seen such a meaningless plot performed in such a stuttered and forced manner, and can only convince that the actors were so harsh as the protagonist the author allegedly was in the film itself. Everything in this violent adaptation is exaggerated. And if it is not wood-like, almost as if you can see the teleprompter, it is itself that is overbearing and disturbing in completely unnecessary ways, and exaggerated to an unthinkable degree, enough to put you off the whole farce. <br /> <br /> Regarding the supposed shock of a detective in disguise, anyone who does not see it - as well as the rest of this ridiculous plot - must be telegraphed light years in advance, check their eyesight immediately. <br /> <br /> Bad plays, and from two very decent actors, combined with the exaggerated Branagh trademark overdirection, are enough to enable you to use real balls rather than spreading yourself. <br /> <br /> On top of that, there is a totally risky undertone of homoerotica in this, elevated to the end of it. All I can hope for is that it was such a flop that people should not try to imitate this level of cinema ever again.
