I remember being forced (yes - literally FORCED) to see this movie of a Southern Baptist pastor when I was a child, and even then I loved his horror. It is designed to scare bad suckers into being "rescued." The only thing that "saved" me was that it finally ended and I could go out and have a real life. Take a look at the chapter on this movie in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of the Christian Right." EXCITING. And definitely more interesting than the movie!
