I was happy to watch this movie for free as I work in the hotel industry and this movie recently came to our movie library. Nothing against low budget films, but this movie has horrible plays and directing. How can a movie like this ever be made. The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors it is probably not a jump table in a career. Make sure you do not see this movie, the actor is paralyzed, the camera and controlling terribly. There are just a few more movies out there that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give it to charity so it serves at least for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case I would see it another 10 (or at least once more).
