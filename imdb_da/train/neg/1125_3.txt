I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I've heard about this movie, I don't really know if it was in the theater at all. I don't remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of the post-school specialties. The action is ok, not great. The reason was weak and the lines were rather grainy. So the only comment I can give this movie is "Eh" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy, if I was in a movie rental, it's one I'd go by and after seeing it, I wouldn't recommend it to any previous middle school age. I've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed, the snake is overused or just obsolete. Many times I think that's what makes their characters incredible.
