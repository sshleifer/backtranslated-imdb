This movie was just painful to watch ... not in the good dramatic way that makes you hug with feelings of well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I made up almost the last sentence I joined) but in just an absolutely boring way in over two hours. Now you all think I am just a little ignorant proofreader who does not respect Shakespeare or "artistic filmmaking" ... well, you would be right on both sides. I love the Shakespeare works, especially the tragedies Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I've seen lots of "arthouse" films like the surrealistic and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. .. but it was just over two hours translated Shakespeare, WAY too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not in every second shot of a movie !!! IT WAS PUNCTIVE AND SERVICE Nothing for the story !! !), and basically just excessive filmmaking. I had high expectations for this movie, being said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but it was just an extreme downturn. I gave this movie only 3 because because of Sir John Gielgud's presence (which far surpassed all the non-names in this movie) and the combination of movie / set design as it did many scenes resemble moving paintings ... however much of this movie would have been better as just a painting with a scroll of text beneath it. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli had got the director's chair, it would have been much better. But this is an audience's opinion, many others can enjoy this much more than me. Having said that, if you can't find this in any nearby video stores (it's not currently on DVD), try not to go too far out of your way to find it ... it's not really worth it.
