This image started with good intentions, the Bacon scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is sweet as usual in his role. It all falls apart after that, it is your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humor, white or soul. In other words, don't play your time watching it here. Get the audio cassette with John DeLancie as the invisible man instead with Leonard Nimoy. Now it was good, and HG Wells served well, unlike this mess.
