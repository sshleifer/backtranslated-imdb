This horror movie is really weak ... that's if this is the right movie I comment on. Nothing really terrible goes on, as a family adopts a cute little German Shepard puppy. I had a German Shepard and it is a really good dog. I didn't get the idea of ​​getting one from this movie, but rather from the comedy "K-9". However, it is another story all of it. This movie really does not have much horror at all, as the most horrible scene is at the end, and it really looks like cheesy. We also see a guy almost laying his hand in a lawn mower. It's about it. The father suspects something since his family seems to be quite strange, somewhere he finds out if you are holding a mirror to them while they are sleeping, you can see if they are in possession. All in all, a really weak horror movie even by television standards ... television movies that work out there, when "This House is obsessed" is pretty good, and there is another haunted movie about a woman and those strange creatures which is also pretty good. This one is really pretty boring.
