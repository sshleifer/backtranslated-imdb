The film uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. Kill Kill would have been nice. The movie contains taboo scenes to make the viewer move back into their chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and choppy. The movie is something that a beginner screenwriter could have tamed. Just waste movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie when it's not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to push to let people know to avoid the nonsense. If people expect to choose a good movie for the night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by exposing yourself to this filth.
