This movie didn't look funny - such a waste of great stars that seems to be trapped so in their own style that they forget. Only shining moments belong to John Cleese as a hotel manager who likes to dress up - you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter as he dances to Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while you have high heels, a mink and a delicious hat. The rest: Forget it!
