In what seemed to be the longest 1 hour 35 I've had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino delivers a precise performance to be safe. Not his usual typecasting, which was nice. But his character was just truely pathetic. Someone to piss when he stumbles around, forgets agreements when we realize that Hollywood's social life has drained him from his life energy. But in this movie we needed someone to like it. And for some reason, every figure in the picture said "I don't know why I like you, Eli" to Al Pacino's chracter, and I couldn't even get close to him. <br /> <br /> All the other players played their usual styles. Te Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on television or in previous films. And Kim Basinger wasn't even in the movie enough to deliver a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The story of the film had no speed. Most scenes never drive the story forward, but merely collects factoids on characters that later came into play in an anti-climactic ending. It had potential apart from their unwillingness to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz wanted you to believe "When Hollywood has you, you can't come out." Yeah right! And so many people are fired in Hollywood.
