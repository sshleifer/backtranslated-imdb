I feel that the film did not historically reproduce Smith. The goal of this movie was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "pleasing" to Church leaders in LDS that historical accuracy seems to have been of little importance. The film was designed to be a "belief" experience, not a balanced perception of Smith "as a man". I have taken it on myself to study Smith's life and have read both LDS works and no LDS works. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully recorded and well-acted. However, this was not a realistic depiction of either the beginning of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> A significant period of time was given to rebuilding an accident that Smith had when he was seven. While this event was undoubtedly important to form its mental outlook, it seems that the main reason for including it in the movie is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is to portray Smith's teens that the film is silent about the Smith family's involvement in magic practices in the 1820s. Another problem is, while the film shows that Joseph Smith goes benevolently into wrestling competitions, it doesn't show how he sometimes lost his mood and became fierce. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This film was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I would not recommend watching this movie for purposes other than entertainment.
