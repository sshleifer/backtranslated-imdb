You'd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without having to do anything about it. However, this documentary seems to need to throw everything in the bright light. It speaks of the risks associated with the moon module and mentions Armstrong's almost deadly accident with the exercise car as if the coach and spacecraft had something to do with each other. This makes the computer's overload problem (1202 and 1201 alarm) that occurs during the last landing sequence sounds like a near-miss, as it was only an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all. And it takes the "30 seconds" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel back before they run out when it is actually 30 seconds before an abortion is mandatory. <br /> <br /> To see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go to "From Earth to Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip it.
