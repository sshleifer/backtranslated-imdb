This movie is so bad it made me throw up. Poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone. Why in the name of God would you falsify a movie that is, to a degree, a spoof (and a strange fun on it) as it stands? The sets are ridiculous, the effects are so bad that they aren't even ridiculous, and the acting farcical. It's a complete mystery why you would even consider seeing this lump of waste. National Lampoon once made Animal House, which people still consider complete and completely fun. Now they have been referred to making television films like this clump of ****. Name your explosive and it could be exactly used to describe this movie.
