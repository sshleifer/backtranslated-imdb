I really tried to like this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: sex abuse. In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, for having nonstop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) threatened his marriage, work and even his life. <br /> <br /> production values ​​are terrible; mainly the action. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are made in very bad taste, and you may think you see a homemade flick. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot is just not feeling. How could such a beautiful and beautiful wife stand all the nasty things from the man? How could she believe in him? The third situation is invaluable and makes you cluster for a while. <br /> <br /> Also, the scene with the black cinema attendant is just meaningless and will let you think "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like those you find plenty. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid it; It's not soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. It is a pretentious effort by a so-called documentary director or anything. Only Mrs Kinski's legs on the screen are worth seeing. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But the 90 minutes of my life do not come back.
