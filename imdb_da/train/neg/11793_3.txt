Deep Shock plays like a TV movie: An entire cast of commercial-grade actors, a poorly-designed creature, the "bad guy" and a script more full of technical, political jargon and imports than that knows what to do with. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their design in these cheaply made videos), and right from the bat I was disappointed because the Being on the box wasn't the one in the movie. The actors I had expected because of the type of movie it is (really quite generic and not thought out beyond a certain point). The music was typical, non-thought-out action-symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment along with mini-sub design. The movie itself flowed really well, with guards that let you know which set you see the story unfold in. But there is not much history here anyway. This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO. The boring search and destroying mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protect it ... a little sorry. Even lamer is the brand-on love relationship between two of the characters that you cannot see coming. Krit this one up to be a movie trying to get the actors' career out of the bench and into a video. Do not want to.
