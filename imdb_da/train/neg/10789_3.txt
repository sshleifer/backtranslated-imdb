If you expect to see much in Altıoklar's bath, as promised by the roofline, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie is nothing but the populist style Altıoklar about most well-known topics like sex, marriage and cheating. Too much nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and which has no connection or whatsoever to the plot, shows that Altioklar failed to "try something new" as he has quoted. Too much sex-centered jokes seem to show that Altioklar had fallen for the famous saying that is "sex seller." I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narrative technique. But eventually I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and seeing Altıoklar's experimental, yet too much focused on popularity work.
