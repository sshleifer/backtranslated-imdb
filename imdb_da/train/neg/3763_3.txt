A group of woodcutters and scientists enter the forest to find fossils. They stumbled on a Bigfoot burial site eventually (it didn't notice it in the dark), CGI Bigfoot scenes are horrible, but better than the endless scenes to speak that they rarely puncture. I used to think that there might just be a good Bigfoot movie to make. But now, after so many sad sad films about the legend, I have serious doubts. To pour salt into the wound to see this movie, the one beautiful girl just doesn't get naked once. And although this may be better than Boggy Creek 2, it's still sad that the best non-documentary on Bigfoot remains "Harry and Henriksons". <br /> <br /> My character: D
