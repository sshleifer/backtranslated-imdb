This type of plot really has a lot of potential, but it was slaughtered here. Honestly I felt the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would be better after the grotesque birth. Whoa, I was wrong! So crazy scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old comrades before killing them, but of course they escape. Then it's really bad. I should have spoken the times when the rubber shark mask looked out behind some foliage, but I had most likely lost count. <br /> <br /> Pan down to the blood drop from the cut bone to show us how the shark man finds the people. I hate being donated with all aspects of a horror movie. Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there is nothing more cheerful than a middle-agent man reciting Shakespeare ... This is one where you will find yourself rooting for the monster ... if you can carry to see this bad excuse for a flick.
