The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and have seen it several times. And although I know that followers are usually not as good as the original, I certainly would not have expected such a bomb. The romance was flat, the sight gags old, the spoken humor just wasn't. This may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, but it comes close.
