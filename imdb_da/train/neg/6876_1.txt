Yes, it was pure incredibly disappointing babble. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of ​​the United States, that is, Puritanism and views against sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, there was no element in the Midwestern city that was portrayed in this movie, right. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years before his penis is too big? Where in the world will you find it? A jukebox in a bar that only plays vintage bluegrass? A city with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but without any major gas station, no TVs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids ... A people who know each other's intimate details, yet become relentlessly assembled as a big family who hate each other. The adult men plant white cushions at the local cafe, have farms, but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and everyone with equal feelings? The liberated French girl who wants to screw the 17-year-old virgin because of her sexual generosity, the too much meat-cat that goes from getting out into grain fields by just an Illinois breeze breathing to helping deflowers the same 17-year-old farm spider ? HELP! I am so confused and amazed at this film's absurdity that I do not express clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I didn't destroy it for you!
