Werewolf's eye (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was really good, but the overall implementation was just awful. I wanted the filmmakers to have taken their time with this project instead of hurrying it into production. Some blind dude gets some new eyes, bad thing is that they belong to an average old werewolf. Nasty things start to happen to the guy as he turns into a cheesy look. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is the strange little troll that helps him out and what about the female policeman? If you really want to find out, see Werewolf Eyes! <br /> <br /> Not a bad idea for a movie. I just wished that the filmmakers would have spent a lot of time in the final production before they decided to shoot the film.
