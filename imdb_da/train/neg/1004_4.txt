Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is confused when a prosecutor defendant whispers "Thank You" to testifying LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the testimony. In the opening sequences of this movie you get the explanation. You want to see Mr. Cool J's Devil Detective Partner Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decides NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The police in the city "Edison" are so damaged that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and snort their dope. Whether he's out to impress his girlfriend (here called "Pussy") or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption is not good with the noble Mr. Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, reaching both unexpected levels and life-threatening levels of danger. Author / Director David J. Burke keeps the movie over water but only barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in "pop star for movie star" competitions (also called "rapper to actor" progression). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. Borrowed gravitas to the case are factually supportive actors Morgan Freeman (like Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seem lost) ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
