In my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from "Only The Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to a screening of this movie a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate that the director made a film about the men of 442 - a subject that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the play in some parts of the movie was quite outdated. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However, the director should never have set himself as the protagonist of the film. Sorry Lane, you're just not a movie actor. Stick to what you are good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have had a talking role, and her appearance was unfit to play part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the movie who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were they not cast into that role? Another major problem with this movie was its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they were fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature, but since it was a war-based movie, is it not important to show someone who is actually struggling? This movie was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a big deal.
