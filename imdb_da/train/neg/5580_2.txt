I like many of the actors / actresses involved in this project so they are offended by the movie even worse than if they used unknowns. The main problem was that this movie was clearly a concept created to appeal to baby boomers. For 20 or 30 years, Nbc will probably make a movie just about that in the early 90s. I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved in the la riot, and the white family rebels and listens to grunge rock music. The soundtrack will have bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc. The film like this will be as cheesy as the 60s, and I guarantee that NBC will do it. Buying networks is that when you live for a certain period, you do not think I live in the 60s or any decade is trendy retro at that time. Next time someone does something like this, they must put greater weight in there
