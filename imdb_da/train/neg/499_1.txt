Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn Gothic flicks every night from. 22 to kl. 4 in the morning, but their "scary" factor is very limited if one exists at all. In fact, I'm sure I'll find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves special mention because it is I feel the undisputed make of a channel full of lows. I can't even begin to tell you how bad this movie is, but for the purpose of completing the at least 10 lines required by this site, at least I will give it a head start. First, the title is misleading and has no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact, the movie might as well have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for all that has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. There is no blood sugar for miles around, and what's even worse, there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they accidentally made two different movies. <br /> <br /> A more appropriate title would have been: 'Horny Italian Count leads five people to a scary castle and stretches us silly for ninety minutes.' Yes, it fits better. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, and it's scary, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost like wood in turn when he was in his character .... abysmal. /> <br /> The only save graces of this movie is a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the extra attraction that every female character gets her kit off. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, direct a wide birth away from it. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of brutal or cruel nature and no way on the earth of God. I will ever ever see this one again. <br /> <br /> No word of a lie, this movie could put you off pictures for life.
