All David Prior's films are horrible at all points: bad writing, bad acting, poor filmography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the male leader). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The reason for almost every David Prior "movie" (which I would like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American commands hold up to blow up communist evil. But unlike other Cold War era cases like Red Dawn, Prior's movie is actually fun because of their over-the-top venues and plays. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene where Becker (or the other guy?) Is summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something that comes with "this is my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Did you train your roommate? And apparently this will be their solution to avoid exposure. <br /> <br /> If you can find these beads on video, anywhere, buy them. They are all fun and even more fun after a few beers. See them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most over all of them is Final Sanction, with the freakish look of Robert Z'dar.
