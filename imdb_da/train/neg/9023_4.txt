I've seen anime, but I'm not a die hard fan; and I'm not reading manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who grow lyrical about this movie seem to have that background. I've seen "St. John's Wort" and even though it's not a masterpiece on any imagination, it made me download "Shinobi", especially because everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it this afternoon and struggled very hard to watch. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow motion water scenes, autumn leaves on the trees, even CGI eye flicker - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fighting scenes, but in general it was boring as dirt. It seemed as if someone took the "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are star-crossed lovers - and threw some "X-Men" for good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear's suit had his claws, and the gray-haired guy had his ability to heal. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - it's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such stupid powers? Poison girl shows her leg and kisses you to death. The man, that's a good power for you. And the other girl can create bays from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the star's crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic stirring. Wow. I made it to the end of the movie by quickly forwarding it and then a little more tragedy than expected. Some people compare this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero." Don't make that mistake. They may share similar conclusions, but this is where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other movies are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
