SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE FAILURE is another example of what happens when you get a lot of unspecified people together to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of play, production, storyline, FX, etc ... exit the window to create "shock-value". Don't make me wrong now - I consider myself a known "shock" movie, and the scary / gory / nastier the better - but it's still nice to see some kind of talent from SOMEONE involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicle Harry Russo's life - a drug-abused freak show taking orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy, Rubberneck. He continues with a few spree killing hookers and other random people and screams how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (it's "whores" for those who don't speak New York ...) and how he wants to rape them in the row. There are a few weak necrophilic scenes, very little fun and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing you haven't seen in a better movie ... The only redeeming thing that I can find in this retarded movie they are often ( unintentionally?) Funny screaming passports from our headman, Harry. He goes over and over if he wants to kill everyone and make them in the line, and it gets pretty comical after a while. In fact, I am almost tempted to believe that there should be some kind of homo-erotic subtitle for this movie, with the whole ass count and constant shot of Harry running around with his dong hangin 'out. It is quite frank that the joker is more naked in this movie, so they get chickens that show some T-and-A (and some full frontal, for a good goal). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is mildly entertaining as a one-hour watch, but I can really only recommend it to those who might say they saw a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE FAILURE. To be honest - the title is by far the best thing about this bin ... A generous 3.5 / 10
