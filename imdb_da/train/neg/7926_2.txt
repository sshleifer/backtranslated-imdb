The original utilization classic - but far from comfortable at almost any level on some guys making cats for human flesh eating monsters, because the cat food they make is made with people, is recreated with scifi elements added. The cats can't get enough, and when the meat is spilled, the food runs out, cats turn their owners on. Poorly composed at almost all levels, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to play cinemas in the early 1970s, updated with alien cat and dog fights fighting for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack but is so lovable a person (I like the guy thanks to his smile-inducing interviews and commentary track) that you can pretty much excuse the waste he showed most. Mikels wanted to make movies, and he didn't care how they appeared as long as he produced something. More power to him, but I wish he would not submit to his home videos
