Please save money and see something else. this movie was such a piece of shit. I wouldn't go but I had to think I would laugh at least once, NOPE. Not a single laugh, it was so terrible! The chris cat will never get a good comedy role after this and "one night at Roxbury." This film is completely obvious, has no smart sense of humor and repeats itself over and over again. listen to me and say as far away from this movie as you possibly can!
