The Ladies Man is a fun movie. There are not many thoughts behind it, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (ie Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also fun in his short scene (one of the more fun in the movie). Apart from that, the rest of the throw is average and is just there to support Meadows. I have definitely seen more fun movies, but I've also seen stupid ones. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a couple of laughs. However, it was more fun than a shit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much or you'll hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
