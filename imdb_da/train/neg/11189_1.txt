Always enjoy amazing movies that deal with the super natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film struck me just as much for production and direction. There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story should tell; All I can say is that putting it on the big screen was a huge waste of time and effort. The actors, Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an excellent performance in his homeland England and we have seen him in "Still Standing" a television series. Heath Ledger, played the real evil guy and we have recently seen him in "Brokeback Mountain", "05, gave a great support role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair) did a great job of seducing a priest from a church, who was not recognized by any faith, do not waste your time, you will be sad!
