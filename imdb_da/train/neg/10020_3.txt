Vijay Krishna Acharyas 'Tashan' is an overheated, stylized product. Sure it's one of the most stylish movies, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject it. Why? The movie script is like an amateur like a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script, even the greatest all-time instructor can't do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars shown in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you have a script. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he, in order, have a role like this? Akshay Kumar is a wonderful actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks amazing and leaves you standing up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his fault in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The movie fails at the cashier's office, you must stay away.
