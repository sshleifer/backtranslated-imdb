I have always been a little underwhelmed by Joe Dante's original THE HOWLING (1981) ?? so I was not particularly interested in checking any of its successors; some time ago I took hold of HOWLING III: THE MARSUPIALS (1987) ?? by the same director as this one? and found it to be easy to see, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> However, the second installment has a bad rep, and I knew I wanted to see it ?? if primarily to awaken in sight of dear but pompous horror icon Christopher Lee squirming in the middle of everything (the graceful aged star has pathetically claimed a number of times in interviews, he has not appeared in horrific fare since his last picture to Hammer Films back in 1976!). Anyway, this movie should have carried the subtitle "Your movie is a turd" ?? be amazingly inappropriate in all departments (starting with the very important werewolf make-up)! <br /> <br /> The reason (and dialogue) is not only horrible, but it has the slightest connection with Dante's movie ?? Strangely enough, the author of the original novel, Gary Brandner, wrote this himself! Still, one of the undeniable highlights (are ... low points) of the movie is the meaningless elliptical editing ?? who is trying to give it all a style of style but only serves to highlight its embarrassment factor! Similarly, the phoney (and lattice) hokey transitions between scenes, the inane punk rock theme song and the cheap jack special effects on the climax! <br /> <br /> What about the characters, then ?: Lee is the Werewolf's expert, of course, who's all thinking of a crackpot ?? until they come into contact with monsters, that is At least one must admire the creativity of the creators (or mad) by preparing a silly double-meaning subtitle! Incidentally, Sybil Danning (like Stirba, Werewolf Bitch, the subtitle as this is known in the UK!), Picks up an assortment of outrageous S&M outfits ... but her character has hardly given anything to make her supporters' bread and engage in occasional fun three-way lycanthrope sex!); her two creeping lieutenants (one of them a plain black girl) is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> Helping Lee on the side of good is the two yuppie heroes (he is the brother of Dee Wallace's character from the first movie and she is a colleague of her) and a ragged guerrilla type band of Transylvians (still manage to overcome Daning's pretty stupid werewolves!). Notable among them is a knife-throwing dwarf that gets a particularly unpleasant (but at the same time side-splitting) death; He was later revived under Stirba's control to lure Lee (by making childish tongue on him all through the village streets) into a trap. The latter scene must be a career nadir for the prominent and impressive actor ?? Well, either this or the early order in a disco, where Lee is made to make a pair of ultra-cool sunglasses, so it seems to be unclear among the festive youths! <br /> <br /> Finally, if I was forced to mention elements of this which were not completely unpleasant, I suppose that the viarets set (where the heroine is to be sacrificed) is interesting or that the hybrid werewolf / bat being (Daning's pet who likes to "inhabit" its victims' body) is just too strange to be despised ...
