This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays white and other races that are not black as the evil found in our education system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same education system that made him what he is and failed. The Ice Cubes character is the epitome of an inciting black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this movie. Singleton hardly touched the relationship between the white and black characters trying to reach each other. When Omar Epps says "I need to be with my people", the racist remark spoke about volume. And John, don't think for a moment that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairwell didn't get my attention. Nice touch!
