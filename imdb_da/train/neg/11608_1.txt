If this guy can make a movie, then I can surely do one as hell. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I want to add more nude women. This movie had none. I think cheesy B-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I won't let my viewers come down. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out that it is only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And considering the movie was only an hour long, the relationship between dream and film was the right one. And if I decide to make a dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothing. I mean who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I don't want to rip off any movie like Star Wars or Matrix because I want to know my budget is small and I don't want to mask my contempt for big budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in min. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I won't mix modern technology with undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned it into an evil rolly-polly monster before the screen blew up or something. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for qualities in your next horror production, expect me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.
