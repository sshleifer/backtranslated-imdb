I never understood the appeal of this show. The action is poor (Debra Jo Rupp is a remarkable exception), most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try to sit through half an episode. Furthermore, the link between this show and the 70s is extremely indecent beyond the dress's style and the scene and background used for the show. It doesn't seem to be more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clich√©d scripts that modern sitcoms have set out to depict a twenty-year-ago show hoping it will get some nostalgic viewers or something similar. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to see unlike this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show
