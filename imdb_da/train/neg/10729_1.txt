Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the more (most!) Open-minded film actors ... Movies are my passion and I am a great regular on my local cult movie rental site. . I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice on movies when I get there, and I never seem to be able to leave the site without having a detailed discussion or exchange of ideas on what's happening in the cult movie. .. I love to rent weird stuff, and that's why this movie was recommended by one of the guys in the cult movie video site. He told me he thought I should see this, and since the cover said something about being a movie with a Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!) Atmosphere, I rented it. The voice I gave here is not really fair because I didn't think it was terrible, I just didn't know how to judge it otherwise. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made me sick in my stomach: I felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned? Still I didn't want to turn it off, or maybe I just couldn't because I was fascinated by a creepy way ... <br /> <br /> I'll never see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, a 1 like I said. Just not my cup of tea (or vodka for that matter) ...
