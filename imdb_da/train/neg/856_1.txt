These writings write about the end of the plot, so don't read it if you haven't seen this nonsense. <br /> <br /> I found this rubbish movie in the horror section that made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store, I would put it in the COLLECTION section. This movie is so rubbish it will make you feel like you've lost your stockings. <br /> <br /> This movie contains endless images of people running as if it were scary. Now I'm driving to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me, it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people running. Even that little child does it too. He goes round and round and he never stops. What's so scary about seeing a baby on a bike for an hour? I don't think anything, and if you see it, you won't even think about it. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrives at a large castle and they get a ride, just walk around endlessly on the kitchen. Then the man goes about one in an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that's happening, and as you can see, it's nonsense.
