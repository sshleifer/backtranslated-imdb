Standard "paint-by-numbers" monster fare, filled with a bunch of routine plot creators from big-creature movies. It's as if someone had a card game with ideas from other movies written on them that were mixed and treated. Whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal was then thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> Characters are so clich√©-ready that you can play a game "Guess who ends up as a monster meal" after less than ten minutes into the movie, and probably get each one right - including that order that they will be consumed. Many of the characters are so unpleasant that you mess up the creature to open them. Some of the protagonists include: a Billy Idol clone surfing with sharks, a high man's abyss, flashing bank rolls, a Capt. Ahab guy with a vendetta and Ahab's boyfriend who badly dances in a bar. Oh, and a big, big animal that needs anger treatment. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people talk a lot, beautiful girls run around with wet t-shirts, couples train on exotic beaches, explosions occur, ruins of a sanctuary appear, and greasy-faced pirates drop by. <br /> <br /> Entertaining, mostly, but one thing bothered me: the slightness of the characters when others were killed. After a violent transition, they make one-liner jokes. I could almost hear the shots. All in all, OK if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at such a bad-it's-good movie. Otherwise you can skip this one.
