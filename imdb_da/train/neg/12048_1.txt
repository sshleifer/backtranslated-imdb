I've gone out of about 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know how I sat for an hour of it. I must have been in a coma there at night. I saw it in the theater when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew Penelope Ann Miller stared into it. It really must have affected me to waste my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomiting! Vomit!
