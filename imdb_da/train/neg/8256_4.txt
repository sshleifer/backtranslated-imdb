The only word I would like to describe this movie is: Plain. The plot of Gary Sinise's character trying suicide is a ridiculous assumption, and it's like a kind of Salingerist hermit or recluse in a cabin driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldn't cope with the lucrative pro / am golf community? weep a river. I wish these were my problems. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise. The scene where little Timmy Price is mistreated orally by the other member of the club in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that I am embarrassed to see it
