This should be one of the most incredibly stupid movies I've ever seen in my life. Just as I think I've seen the stupid scene in history, an even more stupid and bizarre scene comes. I think the transvestite poodles did it for me, or even better, her talking tongue ... or maybe the guy got the virgin mother statue mounted on a jeep windshield trapped in his neck. Decisions, decisions ...
