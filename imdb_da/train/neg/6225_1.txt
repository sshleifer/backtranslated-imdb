I doubt this will ever be a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to be safe and I don't expect much from this movie and became even smaller. What could have been wise and moving was campy. It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar to myself as a fan of Grams and all versions of his "afterlife adventures" I have heard. Rock and roll is full of narratives, good too, but they have to bring a grain of salt. They can be good stories, though exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and became a tripe. Stealing any dead body and its implications must never be a dull story, but they made it boring in some way. I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, go out to the desert and burn them all.
