I couldn't recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece (believe me, double negatives are required here - it's so bad). This movie was in trouble from the opening circles when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are too long, and none of them are good ("Many thanks" have a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I will be happy to wear the chains worn by Scrooge in the movie's bizarre hell order than to sit through this insult to film musicals again. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining part of this movie (by the way, incidentally) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly powder white costume, Guinness voluntarily adorns through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it seem like he was fluent as a ghost or to show his complete disdain to being in this horrible movie . In the meantime, Albert Finney blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly lying character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is so scary a person, it is impossible to believe in his transformation. Indulge in this abomination with filmmaking at all costs.
