Judging from this movie and the strong man made the same year, I wouldn't place Harry Langdon at the top of the big silent screen comics list. There is simply not enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style, but sabotaged himself by taking his first major successes seriously. In any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of the great funny men, but he lacks Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's mighty ingenuity. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking as Chaplin's tramp character. His trademarks are childish innocence, the closeness of closeness and a tendency to respond to disaster by looking confused, tearing his eyes, or touching his persecuted lips with the tip of his forefinger. Comedy in Langdon's movie is the result of fate that throws various obstacles in its path as he tries to overcome in wimpy or naive ways or with a minimum of physical body, such as throwing stones at a nearby tornado to drive it away and throw it a collapsing building with a two-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so they roll under him. In this story, if a son of a shoemaker joins a hike across the lands to publish a rival's footwear, he manages to win with great luck. There is nothing here that has not been done much better by the big three.
