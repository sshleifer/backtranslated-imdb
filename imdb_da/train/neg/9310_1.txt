OK - I ADORE this movie ... I want to credit this movie - alone - to make me such a deadly horror fanatic. I could never see this movie alone. I have also heard many many stories about the effect it had in the original release in the theaters, on its viewers. Incredible masterpiece .... Terrible, psychological things frighten my pants. And bless their hearts, the one who made this amazing movie. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not what happens in the movie, and the idea of ​​the movie is not scary enough, but what always got me - was Brenda's amazing play. Best horror movie ever. Nothing can ever be so scary again. Halloween showing on his evil.
