From everything I wanted to read about the movie, I was excited to support a Christian theme film. Everything about the film was very unprofessionally done. Especially the writing! Without good writing, a movie doesn't have a chance. The author / instructor said in an interview that he would not give away how the title relates to the story. Believe me, that was no big surprise. I continued to wait for a teen / young adult back story to unfold, but it never did. As one who has gone through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would not have been a comfort to me as I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
