The only reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneales brilliant QUATERMASS series was broadcast. The trailers emphasized that the protagonist had a mutilated arm who had hoped he would be like Victor Caroon from QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT who stalked London's streets. <br /> <br /> No such luck because RACING GAME is just a right killer thriller with gimmick having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing. I suppose if you are a fan of Dick Francis, you like it, but put it in the end of the 70s when THE SWEENEY was just finished and PROFESSIONALS still produced, something about THE RACING is missing. GAME. A trailer showed a car over to take another on a highway, if it was a trailer for THE SWEENEY then you would see Jack Regan take a car and get acquainted with the slag that had made a blur while PROFESSIONALS would have Take a car and blow away the terrorists inside. I think that sums up what's wrong with this series
