- A newlywed couple moves into the home of the man's dead past wife. It is not long before the new wife begins to feel that someone does not want her in the house. She sees skulls around the house. But when the man examines, he can't find anything. Is anyone trying to drive her back to the asylum she was recently discharged from? Or is the dead cross ghost trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I've seen The Screaming Skull without the help of MST3K crew. And it will probably be the last time I see it this way. Can you say boring? I'm not talking plainly boring - I'm talking that grass gets boring. There are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens. The screen might have run out and I would have gotten so much entertainment out of it. The characters drone over and over with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The screaming skull could probably be marketed as sleep aid. <br /> <br /> - The actors don't help much. Most of them provide lines with the beliefs usually reserved for a college. I have not looked it up, but I would be shocked to find out that someone associated with this movie has ever appeared in some of the film value. I don't even go into the script that the actors get to work with. Let's just say the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines that have ever been said on film. <br /> <br /> - You've been warned! You can either avoid this at any cost or at least look for the MST3K version.
