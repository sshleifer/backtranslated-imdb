Welcome to a bad ghost story and somebody's nightmare. This horror story finds a newly married married man (John Hudson) and wife (Peggy Weber) haunted by my former wife and screaming skulls found in their empty mansion and lily pond. Is the man really trying to run his already eager brides insane? Or is it the learning-challenged gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol) who has taken care of the grounds of the house since the death of the original mistress of the house? This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way to the final. Special effects are quite poor even in the 1958 standards. I sometimes swear the screaming skull sounds a lot like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the lurking gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can capture this as part of the AMC's Monsterfest.
