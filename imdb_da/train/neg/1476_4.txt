This pretty formal sword and flying fist film is a decent early show of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable. Unfortunately, the film works under the burden of a boring story and a sharply low budget (check out some of the set battle scenes if you doubt me). Nevertheless, it is worth seeing, especially if you can catch in the mailbox.
