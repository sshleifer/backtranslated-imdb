This movie had a pretty good sounding plot, but the pasta was very slow ... very slow indeed. Although someone thinks this is a cult classic, I think there are much better movies from the era to be seen. <br /> <br /> The camera is not excellent but not the worst either. the sounds are ok. lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I still don't recommend it to anyone but maybe a movie student. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't contain music, and the horses have sex don 'it doesn't do well either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was simple stupid. <br /> <br /> No winnings here, skip this complete boredom. I've seen worse believe me, but it's just a waste of time and I'm not getting the good reviews here. especially the high ratings ...
