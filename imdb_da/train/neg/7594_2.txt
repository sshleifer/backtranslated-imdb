In light of the story of the director of this movie, it is hard to believe that it was such a painfully bad movie to sit through. I was at the European premiere last night and one of the leading producers was there. He was not yet watching the movie and he was a surprise. I have not read the book on which this is based and I do not know whether it is highly rated or appreciated, but I have read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and given how poorly it was adapted to the screen and how bad this film was where, I can only assume that something similar has happened here. The action was not bad, although there were a few too many raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I can't believe how little I cared about any sign in this movie. Situations are played on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. Donald Sutherland's part consists of a couple of scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I continued to look at my watch as I did not go into dialogue on the screen. I never went to a movie, but I was tempted to start with this. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons that seem terribly low to me, but that's the best thing I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the too-short earthquake scene and the other is that Salma Hayek was naked and looked beautiful. I can say something else positive about this movie. Don't ask the dust anything, it can't speak!
