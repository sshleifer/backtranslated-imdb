A two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. This is a must see first and foremost looking at the work. There is a lot of work shown, see the close-ups, man you want to enjoy. A couple of years ago, a video clip was probably based on this movie. It is a slasher but without excitement. The end is also fun, and the clothes she wears on the tree facing the copper, Jesus, resembles a clown. The killings are mostly done by the screen, the blood flows, but never for gory. There is also a lot of battle scenes, and hey, no one was hurt. And what about weapons killing, never seen a big one like that won't ruin what you should see it. And being a slasher is also a lot of T&A. To guess who's the killer, you'll be caught a few times and that's the best part, but what about the history of copper in the woods, huh! But still because of his cheesiness, this is still one that many would like. I am glad that I have my copy, one of those slasher errors. But man, the clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in your 40's then this is one back to the memory path.
