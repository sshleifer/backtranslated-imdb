Overlong drama that is unable to make any real point. Then she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - big deal. There is some eccentricity among the characters and in dialogue and situations, but the kind that is bad for the movie, which makes it seem absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, leading the lead, speaks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there's no choice but to watch the movie as if a retarded girl doing it in the theater world - which clearly doesn't was the intended point. We are told early (in the "Barry Lyndon" -like story) that she learned to hide her feelings, which certainly explains her autistic stone face, but the movie suffers from it. She basically goes like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not quite credible because of her lack of emotion. Occasionally, the movie had the dull, sleepy feeling of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it one? I wouldn't be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late Phoenix River. Nepotism rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism list, with over 350 images / records, contact me by email.
