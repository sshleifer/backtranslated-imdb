This movie is a very bad attempt to make money using a classic theme. I used to love Superman movies, but one made me shoot myself. Very bad actions, monstrous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. To sum up: Superman leaves the ground because scientists discovered parts of their home planet, some were in space (duh), do not tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (duh again), embark on a spaceship (?!?), Come back I think 5 years later and look forward to connecting with her boyfriend again (who is now raging his son, which son is in my humble opinion at least 7 years old). And what about Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie just because I'm not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, don't go to see this movie and even if you have nothing else to do, be home and watch TV!
