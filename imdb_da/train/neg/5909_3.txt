The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers showed that he only had a good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolutely lowest common denominator humor. Painful view. A complete task. Written without a doubt in less than a week, like the first one. Give Meyer's hook and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And don't let him out until he has developed a decent script for something, something. He's got it in him. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let Goldmember sink without track.
