The story behind this movie is very interesting, and generally the plot is not that bad ... but the details: writing, steering, continuity, pacing, action sequences, stunts and use of CG all cheapen and destroy the movie. <br /> First off, action sequences. They are all quite unexciting. Most are made up of a person who stands up and gets shot, makes no attempt to run, fight, dodge or anything, even though they have always been in the world. The sequences just seem to be boring for something made in 2004. <br /> <br /> The CG has very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they appear to look cheap because of how they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: Everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start you can make back-flips, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the film. Like Lilith she would not have needed to be able to make her back again - maybe she could not when she had wings. <br /> <br /> We also have sequences like a woman running over a car and getting up and just going down into a desolate room with a sink and mirror, and then she sticks her throat, all without apparent reason, and without any of the spectators caring that she's just hit a car (and then felt the secondary effects of another exploding car) ... "Are you okay?" asks the driver "yes i am fine" she says the blood and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I saw it all, however, because the introduction promised me it would be interesting ... but eventually, the bad execution made me want something else: Blades, Vampire Hunter D, even the movie with vampires, where Jackie Chan was comical relief, because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but it just made me shake the director awake and give the author a good chat.
