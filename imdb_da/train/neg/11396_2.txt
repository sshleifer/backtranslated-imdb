The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that does not go directly to the Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from nightmare on Elm Street to the Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it appear ... just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wood, the story is paper thin, and the actors can't get out of a shopping cart. Put it all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Seeing this movie is very much like that. Fabricate it for 90 minutes and you are left with a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
