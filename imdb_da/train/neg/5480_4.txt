It was at. 1 in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don't judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We are back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group has settled on an island. It does not take too long before they come across a large "reptile" that gobbles up their horse. Soon, they are captured by natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the "reptile gods". CG sucks; It reminds me of CG of early console video games. The meetings were paralyzed. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit. Otherwise, it's just a mediocre effort.
