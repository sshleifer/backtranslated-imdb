In fact, these young people were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wait for them all to be slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) when I considered her the most annoying of the pile. <br /> <br /> But I knew it was a mess from the opening hours when a teenage Christine opened the lighthouse on the pastor and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background. It had nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked fake and the "blood" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch, but later it took the red day-glo to match the silly Halloween makeup they were all wearing. I am sure that all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t as it will appeal to that bunch. It didn't know I appealed to me. Blah ... <br /> And not even my favorite scream baby Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teenage fear girl from herself. However, she still looks warm. I am glad she cares for herself as we do not see too much of her today. However, it is a step from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) because it has a somewhat coherent plot, so I give it so much. That and the little Boston terrier called Boozer also brings it up. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films must have been desperate when picking this one up. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
