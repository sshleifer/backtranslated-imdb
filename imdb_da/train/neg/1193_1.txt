You know how sometimes you see a crazy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings in the movie? Now it was over. I bought the DVD on Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie you could laugh at. It's really nothing less than pathetic. Ca. 30 minutes in the movie, my friends started to knock me off. About 45 minutes they asked me. After one hour we quickly compromised to the end so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, don't watch this movie. It is beyond painful.
