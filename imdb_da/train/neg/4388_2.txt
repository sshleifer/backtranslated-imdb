Oh man, I know what you're thinking: "With such a title I can't go wrong!" Uh yes you can. I also loved the title, but man I hated the stupid child who played "Satan's little helper". I also hated the mother, and the sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated all these people! Man, it was insane to see it sometimes! The only reason this doesn't get 1/10 is becuz that brings the low budget they did OK. But oh, I hated these actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money just by using halloween masks for the killer, and Jesus costume at the end was also stupid too. Oh fear, don't look!
