I must admit that I burst out when I saw a reviewer comparing this with LOTR. Well, if you exclude the dwarfs, the thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classic direction and everything else. Which leaves you going. And boy, is this movie going! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three-hour hardcore going through the Wisconsin countryside, but every four minutes or so, these annoying martinarians will come up for a few seconds to disturb him before he goes for a second time . You've never seen so much going in a movie. If this really had a budget of 20 million. $, Most of it should be on Mr Piano's shoes because he had to get through lots of couples with everything he does. It explains why there is no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or decent actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish videos for people with a thing about going for long walks in period coat. Even on the fast track, this is a payday walk. <br /> <br /> As for the sci-fi stuff, I find it a mistake to put the Martians in the movie: they just get in the way of going, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to go dogs?
