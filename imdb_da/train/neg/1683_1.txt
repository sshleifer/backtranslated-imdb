Hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it made me a little surprised at a few moments. <br /> <br /> If you forget the (unsuccessful) scary dimension and look at other sides of the movie, he is again disappointed. The action is OK, but not great. The story can be a bit interesting at the beginning while trying to get what happens. But at the end you understand that there is not much to understand. "Scary" elements sometimes appear to have been added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (gab) Watch this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do like cutting carrots or looking at the clouds.
