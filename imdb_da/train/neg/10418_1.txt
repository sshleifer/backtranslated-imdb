THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for children under 5 years. For a month my 4-year-old would from time to time ask me "Why was this rabbit bleeding from the mouth" or "Why does the bulldozer bump all the rabbits?". (And it wasn't the worst of it). We stopped there in a 1/2 hour but the damage had been done. Intense morbid, repressive, violent. Fortunately, he is finally forgotten by the whole miserable. Anyone who decided that this film should be marketed should children be taxed. ... (Continue censoring me, my conscience is clear.).
