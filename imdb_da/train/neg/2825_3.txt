This week I just thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim, just having seen the two "Lost Boys" movies last week and all. Not that I'm a fan-boy - not far - but I liked these two Coreys in some movies back in my early teen days. <br /> <br /> I was preparing for three movies with him. Unfortunately, I have chosen the "Dream Machine" as a first (never seen it before), and it was so horribly awful, I just decided to lock Corey back in my closet and leave him tight again until I jump into something else of his. But I managed to fight my way through this movie first. I had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but was caught in his own delusions. Virtually the whole movie will be a comedy, and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller. The only good thing about the "Dream Machine" is the premise: A dead body in the baggage of a Porsche. The rest fails so badly, it's embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. I can dig him as his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some kind of direction. That was clearly not the case in the "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, the black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? Some guy who falls flat on his ass like the villain in the movie, tries the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk, never succeeds properly, and at the end of the movie he thinks he is Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner mask) and error Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried. A stupid, unfunny movie with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director who doesn't know how to lead his throw. Great success! <br /> <br /> One final question for Mr Haim: What was the idea of ​​making you smile directly into the camera in the last shot of the movie? Your or the director's? So not done.
