I've always been interested in something about Bigfoot, so when I looked around looking for a movie for rent, it got an eye. It was the WORST $ 4.50 I've ever used and I want my money back! Don't waste your money on this !! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring, and I found myself rolling my eyes a lot, and I didn't even see it all the way through. I just got along well with it. The action was horrible, the effects were terrible, everything was just really bad and tasteless. It all set to be a really bad, boring movie and a total waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then I have to sit through countless cheap duds like this to find the right masterpiece.
