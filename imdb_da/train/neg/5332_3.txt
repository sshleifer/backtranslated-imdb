OK, the depiction of the stereotypical "Indians" in this story is simply not wrong. I agree that Elvis looks good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the film. I thought, ok ... he was never so brown in real life. It's some of the most obvious brown "Indian" makeup I've ever seen. It is as bad as the 'Indians' at 'F-Troop' and the old Hollywood Westers who were played by Jewish and Italian American actors and not true Indians! <br /> <br /> This movie is ok but typically lama story and mediocre songs, as in all Elvis' later films. He just made them because Colonel Parker got him tied to long-term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible! I continue to think 'thank goodness' that Elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. It's cool to see actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, though. Burgess Meredith's 'Indian' makeup is absolutely TERRIBLE. It's the worst of the pile for sure. What did the filmmakers think about? Was Mr. Meredith does this one just for the money or what? However, I love some Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even stand by to watch her movie with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change Of Habit', where Elvis plays an inner city doctor. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, at least Elvis made a lot of good movies, but the mediocre and bad overwhelms the decent and good. <br /> <br /> I always love ELVIS! Many thanks, thank you!
