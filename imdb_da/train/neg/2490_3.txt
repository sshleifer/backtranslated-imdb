What a sad sight these television stalwarts are doing is driving the clock on their careers, stumbling on a ship's rustling cavern - the boat may be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it is not helped by a "big name" star who can hardly spit out the few lines he is credibly given. <br /> <br /> In no time does support casting over the material; They clearly see the clock here. Bang out the scenes, get pay check, go home, and try to forget about it. <br /> <br /> It's not very badly written or filmed; There are no real clangers, it is just anodyne and shot in a very limited number of tight sets with a small molded extras. Pacing is a bit bizarre; a shameful preliminary romantic subplot is only begun after the main activity starts, making it irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The Maiden Voyage scores a few points to be competently scored and to be a fun game of "placing the kiwi piece of particles"; Most of the cast are candidates from Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this movie is probably their big break.
