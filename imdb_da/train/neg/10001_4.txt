This movie was missing something I couldn't put my finger on first: Karisma from the leading actress. This was inevitably translated into a lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man. Even the romantic scenes came to be just the actors in play. It might well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just don't know. <br /> <br /> Could it have been the manuscript? Exactly who was the chef in love with? He seemed more enamored by his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately by himself and his youthful exploits than anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. But don't forget that it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
