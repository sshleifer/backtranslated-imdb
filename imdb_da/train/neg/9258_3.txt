It is unfortunate that someone decided to stumble upon the best horror movies from time to time in my book. This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three movies, goes as far as even copies how people die and what will happen in the future to the key people, and it basically tries to slam three movies in one and fails. It even fails to create a good frightening atmosphere for one (except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings to mind the old films). The only thing we can be grateful for is that there has not been an Omen V.
