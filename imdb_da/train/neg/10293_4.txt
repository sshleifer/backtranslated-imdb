My wife and I watch a movie every night without disturbance, and mostly artistic films that require thought. I have tons of patience for movies that are slow to bloom. My wife has twice the attention span I do. All that is said - this movie is just empty and BORING! It went nowhere. Never flourished. It started quite strongly with a promising plot ... so she bakes cookies ... goes to Spain .... she sucks, she stares .... the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We FF'd through several extended sequences of her just staring into space. Artificial depth was implicated when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully shot chick-flick pretending to be deep or artificial. You never learn or understand Morvern at all. About halfway through you just don't care more. We just wanted to see that at least one of the plot lines evolved. Don't waste your time on this. I am shocked that it scores so high.
