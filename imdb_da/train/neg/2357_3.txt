Let's hope this is the last nightmare. This is the epitome of a good thing that has gone bad. Okay, there is still some pleasure to have, but only in the most common sense. Rachel Talalay had been there during this franchise, had been on the production staff and produced himself. I don't know what she was thinking, but this debacle comes complete with the human video game kid and a guest game <br /> <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote / directed this disappointing piece of waste. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was no more than a hardened popcorn movie rather than wearing any resemblance to horror, with the constructed use of a 3D ending. Aren't these glasses nifty? And you're going to keep them! That's just like you've just spent $ 9.00, which makes me rich. Here are 10 cents. Now you don't feel special! Sorry, but for me it has not made me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy had another facelift. This was the worst, I think. All the beautiful art forms that went into his "look" in the earlier films have been replaced by a clearly cheaper, less detailed set of dentures. He looks ... less like the burning victim he has to be, and more like he has a skin disorder. Changing the management's makeup so far in a series is at the same level as changing the main actor. But wait! They've done it and done it. So I guess it doesn't matter. But it did give me something. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... another low pure monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the authors thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee (unfortunately it was short on both accounts). <br /> <br /> So there is nothing more to say than grabbing popcorn and getting ready to laugh because there wasn't a scary or exciting moment in this whole movie. <br /> <br /> It bets a 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
