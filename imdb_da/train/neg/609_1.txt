This was a horrible movie. Don't be tempted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but it must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great plays couldn't solve the ridiculous story of this movie. This film is an American propaganda piece from the early 1990s. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Colombian rebels made their case for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso seemed false, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic emotional plug in a film that was without real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are movies like this, devastating actor is like Christopher Walk's good name. I could hardly sit through it.
