OKAY. I think the TV show is cute, and it always has some kind of lesson involved. So when my kids decided they wanted to watch this movie, I decided to feel it together. I wish I was at home and watched the TV show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie. The plot is next to non-existent, the signs seem to exist in a vacuum, and the biggest thing is the Gadget does not carry any lesson at all. It seems that Disney took all the things that make Inspector Gadget work on TV and threw them all. To be fair, my younger child (8 years old) appeared on the movie, but the older (10 year old) came away and thought it silly (he was too old for youth humor, but too young for any of the adult humor). <br /> In general, I like Disney movies, but one misses a mile. It's OK for a very narrow age band (say 7 to 9), but a must miss everyone else.
