OK this movie was really "unique" we should say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the movie, although it is said that she had a cooking problem during the film. But she said she can't remember too much of it. yes this is her excuse, but what is everyone else's? I can't imagine they all had a boiling problem. What it wasn't so bad, I think the plot was ok and it had some beautiful fun moments. although the part where the guy gets that thing in his head was a little too violent for my taste. Oh well I guess I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is as amazing and this movie did nothing to her.
