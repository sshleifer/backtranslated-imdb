fulci experiments with sci fi and fail. Normally in his non-horror movies we are still very good, but not here. Some very fun scenes like when the prizewinners are forced to hold a bar for 12 minutes, and if they fall, they are being persecuted. the guy falls and and has a kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who struggled to hold on still lift him off the floor. The city is an obvious model, but not a bad one. and the end explosion is at best ridiculous. And don't let me get started on the terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
