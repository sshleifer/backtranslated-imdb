This movie is a disgrace to Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can't believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes, I realize when the real Indians were pretty good, and the twins had taken their place at the bottom of the US league, but still consistent.) Still, I loved the first big league, liked the other and always I was looking forward to the third when the Indians finally went to the series. You can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the other movie was finished. What happened? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don't see this junk.
