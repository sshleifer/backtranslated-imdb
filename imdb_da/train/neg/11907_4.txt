I understand that the Diehl character is destined to be a microcosm in America itself - to see Arab terrorists underneath each stone only to find out in the end that it is his own actions all the time that got him into that siege state And really if he practices good will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that remain neutral in politics and for good reason, controversy is your weak point and they weaken this a well-created, amazing movie with absurd characters, dialogue and plot. Better luck on your next girl Another thing that poured my bum was that the homeless parts of LA were there to be there for hunger because these people didn't get enough to eat. Really these people don't eat regally, but the real hunger these people are is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-esteem, dignity that you cannot give a man. Yes, they are hungry, and if they need it, it is available. Smaller center of hunger in America, I would say it is more the center of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental illness and economic destruction. To deal with hunger, even if a noble effort is a bond that helps with a more in-depth systematic societal and aging human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good, though Michelle Williams was sweet as the young, yet (cliched) old soul.
