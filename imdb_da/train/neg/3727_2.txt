Written and acted by sincere amateurs produced by an exploit monger, it is boring and difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie ever, but at least whack like _Plan 9 From outer space you usually had a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only for hardcore ironists and hardcore Dispensationalists. Nor am I. <br /> <br /> Don't believe me? See it for free (albeit from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links are mostly added to reach IMDbs 10-line minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
