This show is terrible, the jokes are all awful and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it first before it came into a roll around season two, all the jokes had been played and the characters had nothing to do them. Well at least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on Prairie is typically awful gentle CBC comedy that didn't matter to it from episode 1. Who are the people who see this show anyway, I'm honest, it's old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it himself, the jokes are completely predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it won't be much longer, because all the success this show has had seems to be based solely on the premise that this show is Muslim, which is different and could / should have led to a good show.
