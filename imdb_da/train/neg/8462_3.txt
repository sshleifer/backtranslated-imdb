"Bullfighter" was made in 2000, but it is released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: The confusing story, the incomprehensible dialogue that Oliver Martinez said and the annoying editing? It must be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) goes on a mysterious road trip. They meet with many crazy characters and also avoid some evil. The movie looks good and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to be subtle, do not pay attention to unanswered plot developments and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.
