History The idea behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but the story is sadly a little dull towards the middle, and overuse of stock footage as well as bad special effects drops this film into the sub-pair. <Br /> <br /> The movie begins with a missile position against the ground. In panic, because it is about to hit the ground, the Soviets manage to mitigate the object. However, this is not necessarily good, as this apparently unmanned craft has a steam trail that destroys everything in its path, and the ship is now in a low orbit across the planet. In other words, every pass it comes with comes with a death shift - one that can potentially kill us all !! So it's up to the good scientists in the US (led by a very young and barely recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us - and especially save New York, which is in its immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they can't save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't say if this is a big loss), but thanks to good old American know-how they can eventually ruin this harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> As you can see, the story is not bad and rather original. But so many old clips of fighter jets and guys manning radar scopes get a little old and it looked like padding. All in all, a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre like - everyone else is watching it at their own risk.
