I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. The action was skin-fisted and amateur, the story was old news, and plot development (or lack thereof) always had my eyelids less than halfway through each episode. It's all about what to say about it because it really lacked any substance. <br /> <br /> How can you people like crap like that? It's freaking stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I don't even know how to explain it more ... It's like some of you will be staring fun in junk like this just because you like the way some of the actors look, or because you for any one preferably crazy ground has' I've seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before. <br /> <br /> I just ... forget it. This show sucked, and fortunately it is gone forever. I wish they would work to demolish The O.C. once and for all.
