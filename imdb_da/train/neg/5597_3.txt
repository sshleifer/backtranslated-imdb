I want to say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. The action is mostly not good (I think only Sky showed some promise) and you feel awkward to see it. All the scenes that have to be meaningful are really low as when Ng comes out to his parents. There are many corny details that kanji the tattoo on Sky's shoulder, the magnets on the girls' fridge and god of horrible decor on the sets ... and the music ... and clothes .. and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at a time: "I'm gay, not corny." And don't realize. Even the comment is horrible, I knocked it off after Ng talks about how she was curious about playing a lesbian.
