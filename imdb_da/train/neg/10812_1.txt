What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I won't waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to get back the few hours I wasted on it. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it - Shaq has no business as an actor or singer. He is completely without talent in both disciplines. It's a screaming shame that significantly more talented people are wasting away in community theaters and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly be thrown into movies and cut CDs. <br /> <br /> Much of the error in this movie was the pathetic no talent that is Shaq.
