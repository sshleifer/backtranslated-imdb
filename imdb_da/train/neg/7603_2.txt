I'll be blunt. I'm not a politically correct movie, where the woman plays the bad ass that doesn't take anything bad from anyone. If any of the cast members wanted, they could just have taken her into heartbeat. It was entertaining at MST 3K, but don't rent the right version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
