"Witchery" may just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie from the 80's, but fortunately, it has some compensating qualities like great gore effects, an exciting musical score and some great choices. You probably don't show a manuscript, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays another girl who possesses evil forces, and David Hasselhof portrays a hunky photographer (who can't seem to be laid) in a movie that constantly contains bloody voodoo, stitched-closed lips, head crucifixions, evil burnings and a brash but really scary melody. Eight random people gathered at an abandoned resort town off Massachusetts. The young couple are there to investigate the dark history of the place; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, although no one seems to be bothering who the father is and what his whereabouts are) thinks to reopen the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged together for casual sex. They have to stay overnight in ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the former landlady ?? an aging actress or something that always dress in black? Start taking them out in various exciting ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence that shows a woman accused of witchcraft jumping out of a window. Nevertheless, the plot is certainly of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started out as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is occasionally disturbing, and the makeup effects are undoubtedly the most superior feature of the entire movie. There is something very morbid and disturbing about staring at a defenseless woman hanging up and down on a chimney and waiting to be fried.
