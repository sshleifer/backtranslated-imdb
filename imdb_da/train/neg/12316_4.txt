Director Jonathan Lynn has made some undervalued comedies in the past, like "Greedy" and "Clue". This is not one of them. More akin to a 'Police Academy' movie than its inspiration, it stars Steve Martin in the old Phil Silver's role as a sergeant to always draw scams under his overall nose. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platon looks shaken when an old enemy visits the base, which is determined to capture Bilko in the action. Nothing happens much, really. It's all pretty boring. It's not much fun. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs through pure effort, but they are all better than this, and it is quite painful to see them work with such thin material.
