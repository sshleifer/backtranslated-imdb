Since this game was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been quite different at the moment. So, some people would have found it scary and may have been impressed by the special effects <br /> <br /> Looking at the game in this day and age, it doesn't seem so scary anymore, even the Special effects can leave a lot to be desired. Would a train really be allowed to pass a red light in a dark tunnel? I don't think so ... but if you see this game again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel hurries right through the RED LIGHT! (Maybe it's like that in the dick's time)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path leading down to the Signal Box is very steep and in poor condition. Surely there would have been a number of suitable steps with handrails for the Signalman to climb up or down the cut. <br /> <br /> I don't want to take anything away from the actor, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave amazing performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not at all sure what is going on ...... I think the ghost was the traveler or what ??? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story ??? (well maybe I'm the only one who doesn't) ??? <br /> <br /> In summary ..... The game has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. It doesn't suffer from being so scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and has some rather unusual signaling practices .... Thanks for reading my review.
