I couldn't wait to watch this movie. About halfway through the film I couldn't wait for it to end. All the (white) actors delivered their lines as Woody Allen had just said, "Say it like that ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really speaks, and he didn't stumble over his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy part of this movie was just as boring as the tragedy and absolutely never fun or even entertaining. I must admit that I have never been a great Woody Allen fan, and this movie has certainly not converted me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen.
