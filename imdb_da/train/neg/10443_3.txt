I saw an early screening of this movie in New York, and I was very disappointed with my friends and pretty much the entire audience. The movie wasn't even that bad, it was good; It was as lifeless as a snake bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired for most of it, and the snake effects were paralyzed. It reminded me of one of those cheesy sci-fi movies, except that this movie's cheesiness wasn't fun or even campy. It all seemed to be worn, flat, and obviously formula. I'm shocked to say that I actually think Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it's a piece of it and plays with it, but what the movie fails to start is a script that has some scary tensions. It's the worst kind of lama movie: it's joyless.
