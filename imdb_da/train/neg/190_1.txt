I always felt that a good movie should have a plot. This particular movie was missing one and I feel it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was eager for it to end. However, I only noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; It felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot, but the film also lacked a remarkable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say it was until I saw "The Fast and the Furious". So do not think this review of me is from someone who only needs something but action. In fact, I hate most action movies today; It's just that this movie is completely across the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. Landscapes and costumes, however, were nice.
