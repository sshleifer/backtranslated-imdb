In fact, it was never. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940's screw basketball comedy. What a vacuous shambles! None of these people come close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc. And yet today's audience is not so receptive to this simple muck. Writing is trivial. The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious. The chemistry between the leading figures is non-existent. Interestingly, Julia Roberts seems to think she is a reincarnation of a great star of Hollywood's golden age whenever possible. It is an effect she tries and does not manage again with Richard Gere in the Runaway Bride.
