Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B movies" was explained, but what I was so ridiculous was. Want a good summary of this movie? Take aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good with it and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes into the movie, the "V-SAN team" (it's the stupid acronym I've ever heard) checking out a "base" that has been massaged by vampires, and then they climb down (DOWN? What?) A ladder that is obviously linked to a billboard with an obvious contemporary train in the background. When should this be done? 2210. Okay ... (Hold on, I'll come back to it) <br /> <br /> Yes. the characters. Wow, yes, there are token-lesbian asian chick, redneck cowboy wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire / hot topic box and the wussy noob second on command. Everyone is played by their respective players with the same lack of ambition. It was almost pain to see Micheal Ironside in this flick. Doesn't he get enough money like Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? Almost the only thing that is original about the Vampire War is about how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Looking at this afterbirth of a movie, the only amusement I got was from the weak attempts to set up. Since when does PCI computer card carpet on a weight count as a clear space on a starship? The money required to make this movie could have been put to much better use.
