Fluffer can have strong elements in the porn industry's truth to it - but it doesn't do the fact that it's rarely directed and acted - and with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> B grade from start to the extremely drawn finish. <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think that the public is offered this piece as an example of the latest gay movie production. Hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video. <br /> <br /> This movie opens Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think it will be greatly affected by the amount of alcohol consumed in the previous cocktail party - need it.
