There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "Baby Buggy Bunny" that was EXACTLY this plot. Baby-faced Finster robbed a bank and the money in the cart rolled away and fell into Bugs rabbit hole. He dressed like a baby to get into Bugg's hole to collect the money. The scene in "Little Man", where he looks in the bathroom mirrored with a cigar in his mouth, is right from the comic. This was a hilarious 5 minute cartoon; not so much a whole movie. If you are really interested in this, buy Bugs Bunny DVD. It was very original the first time (1954). Plus, you get many more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to start!
