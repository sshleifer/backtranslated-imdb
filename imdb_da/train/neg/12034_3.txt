The story of the movie was as simple as its morality: Go find a girl, marry her, live with her happily ever. Although the movie had some nice moments and turns, most of it could have been shown in a movie with the same story. The struggle of the Baptist / Mormon was only shallow and mocked, probably conscious. A more interesting story would have been a mixed couple. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that doesn't need too much concentration, which can be seen by the whole family and teaches your children modest and conservative values ​​(besides the modern tolerance stuff ;-)), You are fine with this movie. Can be shown on a family home evening ...
