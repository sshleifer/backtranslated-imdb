I went to watch this movie with low expectations but hope to be charmed by watching my hometown on film. Unfortunately, it's all about everything I have. The story covers well-known area (high school), but the plot is coincidental and supernatural element adds a little to this well-developed theme. Although the quality of the play was good overall, the content of the film was scary. The sexism of the film was obvious - women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, evoke, or both (although this was a post-feminist choice). Even worse was racism - the sharp Jewish mother, the black man still living at home - and the gratuitous cruelty (plagues the class church). We should be ashamed if these signs are supposed to represent the inhabitants of the Kalamazoo City, and the authors should be afraid to have brought such wide and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
