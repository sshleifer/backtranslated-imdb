Tom Wolfe's exuberant, brilliantly observed satirical novel of life among New York snobbery gets a shiny look here, but it is nevertheless well earned. The movie does not only suffer from the abuse of everyman Tom Hanks as a creepy Yuppie, Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As the lover of New York's literature. The most serious miscasting was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could have breathed life into these unlikely characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma for all his visual sophistication has never seen the nuances of the human experience. The resulting movie looks good, but seems to be looking at its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire doesn't make the viewer angry, what's the point?
