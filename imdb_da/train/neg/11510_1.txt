It's not my fault. My boyfriend made me see it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive about this movie. There has been an idea for many years that Madonna could act, but she cannot. There has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great instructor, but he's only mediocre. An embarrassment all the way around. <br /> <br />
