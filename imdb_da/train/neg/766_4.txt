When a Columbo story differs from the well-known plot (colorful killer commits crime, Columbo smokes out killer, Columbo becomes a pest in the process), the authors may somehow never match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates to the extreme and the result is a big flop. <br /> <br /> Do you want to believe: Columbo never faces the villain until the very end? <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was tempted to turn off approx. two thirds through. <br /> <br /> Oh, the victims we self-proclaimed reviewers do !!!
