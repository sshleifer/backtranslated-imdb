How has this movie ever been distributed in the name of all the sacred? It looks like it's been shot on a person's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim's scenario to brand new depths. They literally scream for 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no excitement, no sign and not much play. Just screaming and screaming. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wounds through it to see if anything happened. It does not - except for screaming, of course. Odlly enough, the action of going through it quickly highlights another problem - there is no camera work to talk about. Each shot looks like every second shot - spacing, an angle, dull, boring, DULL. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, it's good. It's just pretty bad.
