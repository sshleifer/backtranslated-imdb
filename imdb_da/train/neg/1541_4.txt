I didn't like this movie intensely and left under the scene where the loyalist gang was shot by the British. The film effectively accuses NI people of the cause of their own problems. It suggests that the 25th war was a matter of implacability and nothing to do with Britain's divider in Ireland and the dominance of its history, ie. NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the desire of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as unhappy fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries, they fought for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over Catholic society. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, undoubtedly keeping the Catholics in bay and demoralizing republicanism. <br /> <br /> Nineties values ​​of 'machismo', masculinity, etc. Implemented in the 1970s Belfast and portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish psyche leading to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - the old Ireland of green fields ..blah ..blah .. - gets a symbolic stature, ie. Bad young fools are fighting for an impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and uncomfortable trash can. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
