As far as I'm concerned, this quiet version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version, it is all macabre, Germanic, creepy nonsense. It reminded me that Nazis fell in love; who cares? <br /> <br /> This quiet version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this one, we have learned John Gilbert and his brutal relative Prince perceive after this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, obsessed with a modern permissive hairstyle and incredibly feminist manner that occasionally struck me. I like my romances bright and beautiful, with slow builds; not hard and sadistic like this one. And come on, the bees stuck lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> See a live show of the show if you want a true idea of ​​the sweetness of the original operetta of Franz Lehar. If you fail, wait until TCM shows Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier's audio version. That is much better.
