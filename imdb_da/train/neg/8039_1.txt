This thoughtless movie is a piece of shit and boring as the whole house repeats. For all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie, don't even think about seeing this bunch of thoughtless work. an F- in my opinion. I have a question, what did they think? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad play 5) bad conducting and last but not least a bad script. I think I don't like grinning about every movie, but I was disappointed when I saw it. This film must be banned in a box, locked and immersed in the sea. So please do something like this again, please, thank you!
