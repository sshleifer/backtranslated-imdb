It's hard to believe when we wait 14 years, we end up with this movie. The original was a high-impact, dark thriller that achieved "cult" status that demonstrated the cinema's art as described by Paul Verhoeven. This movie adds nothing, delivers nothing, and ultimately wins into the big box of failed followers. <br /> <br /> The opening order could have sparked an exciting set of plot developments using a sizeable and capable of throwing. Unfortunately, we are treated to a 90-minute treatise in Catherine Tramell's self-giving life ... or is it Sharon Stone. Possibly a collection of both. <br /> <br /> If the desire is also to see a continuation of the sensuous provocation of sex as in "B.S.1", forget it. You end up with soft porn boredom, which ultimately upholds the old saying that a woman can be more attractive in clothes than out of them. It is interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling turned around in her album, via GEORGY GIRL 1966, when Mrs Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite capable of keeping herself here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true biographer, then watch this movie and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you might as well wait for the DVD release in the "rated" version, "unrated" version, "collectors" edition or "ultimate" version and maybe for another 14 years we will be saturated with news about "Basic Instinct 3 "at what time Ms Stone will be 62 years old and no one will really care.
