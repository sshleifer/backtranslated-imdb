To make a good movie, you either need excellent actors or an excellent instructor. You need at least one of the two. In this eye of the needle we have none. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember the director's name. He must not have done much in his career. I like Donald Sutherland, but he certainly can't be the main character in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for no more than 15 minutes. For example, I would say that Sutherland was excellent in JFK by Oliver Stone when he spoke to Kevin Costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes without stopping without breathing. Wonderful. But Sutherland's main role in a movie is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She is probably good at TV shows. The DVD is horrible. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I couldn't even appreciate the scene on Storm Island for how miserable the photography was. <br /> <br /> This Ken Follet story was good, but it's a shame they turned it into an uninteresting movie.
