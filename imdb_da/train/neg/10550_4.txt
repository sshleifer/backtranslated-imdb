Having been a big fan of the ten-minute T.V episodes of 'Stella Street', I was expecting this movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I was left to feel very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the fact that almost all gags and a liners were lifted directly from the TV episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had told them once, and could not bother to say them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I had separated myself with my hard earned money to see the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Plot of the movie starts with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey) which is gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from the scene and screen over the last forty years'. including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All street celebrities end up being pampered by their entire fortune by a local cheater and are forced to live as tramp and ordinary working class people. There are some good moments, but on the whole the authors manage to take an interesting idea and make it quite boring. * MIRRORS 'CLOSING * <br /> <br /> In the T.V episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the movie Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think it was a mistake. Her imitations were not fun, and her characters felt as if they were included in the story just to give her something to do. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you can find this movie entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you can go away and feel a bit cheated. 4.10
