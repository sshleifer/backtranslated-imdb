There is a lot of torture these days. That's all this movie is. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From then on, it's a straightforward shot at attacking him. I do not know at what time you do something about it. There is a wife and a child out there somewhere; He has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been sometimes when he could have acted. The movie seems to be someone's joke. I assume in the wake of the Manson murders that we had a bit of a fixation on these two. Nevertheless, why should anyone make a movie like this? Which appeals have it except for sadism. The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but it could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist. Oh yes. Another half an hour in my life.
