I've seen better production quality on YouTube! I apologize for the actors, since the script was horrible and the direction shocking, not sure how to get the lines. I really doubt that any actor would have been able to save this movie, no matter how good they were. The signs were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot, which just seemed to go so much. It is really a shame as the premise for the film was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could have been a decent movie. It was certainly not a comedy unless you laugh aloud at dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.
