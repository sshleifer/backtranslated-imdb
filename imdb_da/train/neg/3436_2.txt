A girl shower unknowingly that a serial driver stares at her through the roof window. The detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are warm on his tracks but not warm enough when they find him after he kills, rapes and eats a nipple of the girl. He's shot to death. One would hope that this would be the end of the movie. Not because it is too scary, but because the level of acting is violently horrid. Unfortunately, it is not the end, and months later, rape is risen as a zombie by a satanic ban. Then he continues where he relaxes, with the detectives on the case again, this time a flying baby is also after him (don't ask). There have been very good very low budget films (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring to think), but one scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Terrible plays, crappy dime great special effects, lame attempts at comedy and oh yes, and the end sucks too. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets fully nude; Anne R.
