This is so bad, so very very bad. The story is the greatest joke in history. Don't even bother to see it, I did it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing at the end as at the beginning ... I really don't understand people's tastes, I'm a horror movie fan and I I'm not excited, but I have one limit! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better than the beginning of The Hoast, but that's it. So I recommend you do not waste the 15 minutes you want to see. I think the play is better done by monkeys. And big brother with the parents' role is just awful. Don't they pay C-characters? No, I have to say that this is not the first time I think a horror movie is bad, but it is definitely one in my down ten movies and it will be charming places with a portrait of a vampire, Cabin by the lake, The Hoast!
