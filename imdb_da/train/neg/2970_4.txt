I'm a Batman movie and TV fan. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not as big as some people hoped to be. In my opinion, this is a big disappointment. I think the problem was that it had no drama. Batman: Phantasm Mask and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this movie is bright for Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is the big battle with Bane at the end. Anyways it's an ok Batman movie. But I just wanted to rent it.
