The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry I was biased, I think girl is the only highlight in the movies) and 0.5 for shorter than Azumi 1. I saw Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I was surprised to be able to sit through it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the pluses of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is sweet. It's all there to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the protagonist was male, I'm sure most people (including me) wouldn't have touched the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now we can talk about the minus points. First, it is true feature, with many and many repetitive scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It seems more like a drama way to shoot. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks and also this movie. Second, the film is too unrealistic in a historical framework. I don't mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a bad way to show creativity by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and cobwebs, etc ... it reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a movie of fantasy. In addition, to portray "I don't know", what effect does the director lead people who die with bloodshed (literally) around ... people who have not understood their head were cut off ... etc. .. etc. For many of these, the show destroys. It seems that the anime influence is strong in this movie. It breaks down the show a lot. Third, Azumi must be an assassin. She seems more like a one-man army to me, just that she is a woman. I don't think you see assassins charge in army camps. The only time I felt she was acting as an "assassin" was when she killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.
