I don't want to bother with a plot synopsis when you know what the movie is about, and there's almost no plot, anyway. I have seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rap' movie or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime on those hitherto hypocritical claims. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see on the front page of this movie? That's right: a shapely woman is behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make a fight against rape - and I definitely don't think it was - is right next to that point. The film is the marketing of sex and the titration of sexual assault, and the material is so graphic (anything but the actual penetration is shown) that no one but the hard core utilization will enjoy it. The rape (s) in the movie are uncomfortable, brutal and hard to see. There is something to be said to present a terrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason why this scene could continue with apparently 30 minutes, none. There was also a small character development of the victim, and only one of the rapes is slightly developed (just moments before he is murdered), so that the scene does not even engage at an emotional level. Really, it has just been presented to show extreme sexual violence and you can see the films ISOYG associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.), that it only attracts the utilization volume. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers have praised Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how unheard of everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.), I suppose it was financial decision and the movie looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porno actors do their thing. /> <br /> I'm not going to get everything on my high horse talking about the contents of ISOYG. I am too exploit / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I only give this movie three stars because it really pushes the envelope so much longer than some other movies. But it's also badly made, and after rape occurs, just plain boring for the rest of the movie, as we see a bunch of ho-ho, most gore-less murders and waiting for the credits to roll. <br /> <br /> This is probably worth seeing once you are a hardcore 70's exploit fan, but I tell you that the movie is generally pretty bad and doesn't really appreciate its notorious reputation.
