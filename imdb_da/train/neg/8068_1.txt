I did not have great expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 in the video store, but at least the box showed a little promise with its "killer cut" of "more fun! More sex!" Can't go wrong there! Well ... needless to say, the box is a fraud. How in the hate did actors and actors of this caliber shoot a movie here low? <br /> <br /> It all opens up with a drunk college girl who goes out of a frat house or other building like that and says some useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a poor steadicam follows her. Then she was chased by some guy in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. They beat her wrist for no real reason, and you can see when they "cut" her that someone took the cutters with what looks like a crayon. From here the same theme is repeated for the girl to be chased / killed unbroken by two guys for approx. 84 minutes. Add in a tit shot. It's Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have had a problem with this movie if the box hadn't deceived me to rent the girl. If I rent a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! A full frontal shot of 85 minutes from a chick that is clearly androginous and does not scare a child does not cut it. If this is Killer Cut, what is Theatrical Cut? Of course, I doubt that this waste was actually put into theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this movie. I could see them making their screen debuts here because they haven't done anything before, but they were all established before it was released. I don't know if it was filmed before they were all set up and the studio sat on the movie until they were semi-big names or not. But what I want to know is .... have they really spent $ 14 million on this movie?
