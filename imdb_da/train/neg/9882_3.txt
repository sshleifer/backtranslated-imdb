There are exactly 2 good things to say about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie, where she herself gives Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, which is actually a high compliment. Her nudity is short and discreet, but just watching her face is enough. <br /> <br /> b) The Greek island setting with its sun and crystal clear blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other than that there is no story, the dialogue is creepy and sometimes unintentional fun ("He touched you where you are woman!"), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy shake. Stay overplay's naivete of her character, but then again, when working with dialogue, it is unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a big annoyance). Oh, and even though the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old, speaks English all the time. (*)
