Occasionally a new entrance is served from foreign films. It's their big attraction. They take off their lives and serve it raw. American films rarely dare touch the forbidden subjects in society. Too many hangings and a morbid fear of financial failure. The almighty dollar determines their choice. Something that invites European Directors. In addition, the worldwide audience remains hungry for "various" films, especially those offering a blissful bite out of the miserable, suffering body of humanity. Despite fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry and the untouched life of life. This is what the film "To the Father's Left" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that the unity of the family stems from the unity of its obedience to tradition. But when a family's patriarch forgets it, members are flesh and blood people, filled with violent, outrageous dreams and dark passions, so the two are set in motion against themselves. Selton Mello plays Andr√© a son who seeks to control his inner passion with his father's stagnant philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to extinguish a forbidden thirst from family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The movie offers a lot, but it takes very extreme time to say so. ***
