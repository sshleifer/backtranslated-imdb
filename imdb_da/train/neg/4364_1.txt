I find it hard to understand why this piece of complete waste was repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is Ariauna's body in his sexy uniform. Her humor must also be appreciated. She is a definite plus, but unfortunately it would take a magician to save this waste. But she must be positively recognized for her heroic efforts and true professionalism. Can't say the same for her co-star Lilith with her waving voice that encounters your nervous system. Showed uninterested and gave the impression that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. Everyone said apart from Ariauna's performance, it's actually a complete garbage can.
