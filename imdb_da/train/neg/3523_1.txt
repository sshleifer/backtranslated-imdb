Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallone ?? that should have been enough ?? and with too many rock-climbing scenes, dizziness, falling and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne hoist. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people who destroy a plane to booty and kill various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, who may be depressed by the product's sheer horror, is reduced to sniffing and calling them for whom he doesn't care "Resident!" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was crisp and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is unfortunately being wasted in a rescue club and pilot. Stallone is stole and the muscle head. No deadly lines in this. No live lines, either.
