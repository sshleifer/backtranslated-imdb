I stumbled upon the Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews, thinking I could handle an average movie. However, this film was slightly below average but observable. The script was poorly written and the play was on average for a B-level movie with a couple standing out pretty well. The reason is adjacent to Saw, people are learning what they were doing wrong in a situation and trying to get them to appreciate life more, but it really is where the comparison ends. You dead are trying to have the heart and intention behind simple ideas that are not new. The main mistake I found in nine dead was the face flap of the viewer of flashbacks that happened 3 minutes before in the movie and was completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people would not see in a bad way. Without destroying, I've seen worse from bad movies, and even they didn't finish this badly. Decent flick, bad acting and ending though ...
