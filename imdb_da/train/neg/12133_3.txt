What should they do now? <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be trying to be a combination of acting, the movie and the theater. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of things that actors love - it's a bit like a workshop or a game because it mainly consists of close focus on the actors acting ... acting angry, excited, scared, scheming, planning - gives performing artists a lot of free reach to really hammer it all. <br /> <br /> A trio of villains, a leader, a goon, a brother, comes up with a big hoist scheme. .. and a monkey key is thrown into the works. To the top there is a bit of a "fender bender" and one of the bad guys is thrown through the windshield. <br /> <br /> The Cops are on the tail and they stumble into a bar called poetic (and leadenly) "Dino's Last Chance." <br /> <br /> Spacey, as an instructor, tries to focus on the actors' notions and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a light passionate red cigarette advertisement of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all violence outside the screen, really. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. The focus on the intensity and the cruel violent scenes would have given the film a little edge. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it moves too slowly and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. Gary Sinese seems to be brooding and deeply thought to be a spinless tag - along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing food-yet police lieutenant who is all thumbs up but he's not given anything to really do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role as a brainless shallow, who just wants to waste blood. <br /> <br /> And the bad guys are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they are trying to think of it somehow. <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan ... and they are quiet and too articulate. There is even a scene where the bad guys play pool with a whole swarm of armed police right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the villains even calls the police just outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother. <br /> <br /> These cops will either blow them away or unlock them. Shouldn't the howled villains be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside. Anyone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, leading to a nasty confrontation off-screen and there's another loss that happens, that's ... Well, pretty sorry. But ... Faye Dunaway should also have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a small part. <br /> <br /> A policeman listening in a package of fighting in the worst time is a good look. And it's also a scene where someone goes all the way through the rear window. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dialogue is trying for a David Mamet approach, and it is so profane, but never so realistic or so insightful. The film feels like too much of what it really is ... a real low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time to lead other actors from a script that is "not bad but needs a few more rewrites." Spacey shows that he is not a terrible instructor, but he lacks some sense of "shaping a movie" and it feels as if he is just recording actors. <br /> <br /> These actors are all skilled and able to work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. <br /> <br /> I don't think the wrong actors were thrown. I think they found just the right throw, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would have helped immensely. <br /> <br /> Having veteran actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the package, Gary Sinese as the evil police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn, giving orders and barking on his troops and holding Fischter in his "bloodthirsty goon" part and Matt Dillion as the victim lamb. It would have been a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors work directly, it works. They can even win Oscars for that. But much of the time, when actors directly, they tend to focus only on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for that. <br /> <br /> Hostages are all pretty much the same in real life as old stories, so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well. <br /> <br /> There are a few really good contributions to this genre. 'Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: "The Negotiator." <br /> <br /> This will surely not be a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it has a few good moments and personal details, but in the end it is immediately forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's second direct credit, "Beyond The Sea" was reportedly a better bet. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
