I like British humor, I think this is one of the best in the world. I like almost all British sitcoms (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them I didn't understand.) But this gentlemen's union is just good to make you sick. This show was good in some way; It helped me lose some weight because it seems that I'm not hungry anymore when looking at this piece of garbage. This is really just disgusting, sick and not even fun TV show and I wonder who actually laughs at these things. I saw it for approx. 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting to see men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about it ??? It makes me brush. No humor, just disturbing pictures and cheap, toilet laughs ... I don't know ... if you like these things ... you go ahead ... see it ... but to be honest, people see and enjoy This should have some emotional problems. Trash.
