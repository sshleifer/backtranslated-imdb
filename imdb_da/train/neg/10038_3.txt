The film lacks style, I mean original style. everything looks copied, including action, first appearance in the movie, songs, dialog box delivery, etc. Yes, there were goof-ups original, which initially show a car with the number UP **** number and a few seconds later it starts to fall down a hill with number MH ****. It was one of many goof-ups of the movie :) Something good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if any, kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogues and action stunts. That is it. nothing else. Then see it at your own risk and not blame the director or the actors. The director is already crazy and actors, I am sorry for them.
