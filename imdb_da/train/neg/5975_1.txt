I would never see this movie, so one day, for a joke I saw it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to question the film's policy. It hides behind the mask of women who make it big in the city, but the only way women can make it big is to use their sexuality instead of their intelligence or skills. These women are no longer the whores. Is it a little less attractive that girls are not successful? This is not the only right-wing message of the movie, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge cash in cash. A good example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and something of spiritual, moral, or artistic value is not even looked into this movie. Money is depicted as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The bar's manager says she doesn't allow drug users in the bar, and then she goes on to bad gallons, batting down her own neck and then necking off her staff and customers. Anyone who knows anything about drugs will know that spirits can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. And finally, why are scenes where the protagonist is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she gets stripped or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We see getting her dressed up with the camera almost caressing her legs while she is a phone to her father. She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her girlfriend. I find it most strange. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is immoral, fascist, degrading for women, and honestly, disruptive. But what do you expect more from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
