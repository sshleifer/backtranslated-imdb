I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission, and let me tell you you will see something under these circumstances. Not this piece sh * t itself. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone for weak porn movie quality, frightening out-of-the-blue plot twists and incredible situations and behaviors. It gets worse after that. This movie does not have a single saving grace, and yet it is not bad in a way that makes it fun to watch. It's just awful. I've seen a lot of movies in my life, and I'm not one of the sneaking known critics, I think I will enjoy most movies to some extent, even if they are bad. This one ... man. <br /> <br /> Steer _well_ free from this, my friend.
