Ooof! This one was a stinker. It's not 'somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller' that's for sure. In fact, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and captain EO, only with not so big of a budget, and much more dense ups of ugly teens crying. Simon Le Bon is in front and in the middle, while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide that they stole their entire career from Roxy Musics last 3 albums. Short clips from Barbarella add nothing. Avoid at all costs. (But I liked the part when they played 'Hungry Like The Wolf', but why was there a tiger delicacy in the audience that changes into a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they don't sing 'Eye of the Tiger "or" Hungry as the Tiger "is a wolf! Whatever.) A DVD of Duran Duran's 80s videos is probably worth a look after the nostalgia's
