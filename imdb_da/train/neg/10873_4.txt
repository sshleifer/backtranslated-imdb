Many people thought this is a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the film, a spaceship was crushed on the ground, and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, and then some people killed on the ground but without reason. It's also in a dark forest, I can't see anything on the screen, I can hardly hear the sound. After a couple of days, the predator came to the ground, but no one had sent signals to him before that, he should not know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the alien's principal and killed it for no reason. He was not alive on earth, none of his business is about the things that happened here. Finally, the film's duration is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short, and it can't tell the reviewer clearly about the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I don't think it's a good movie.
