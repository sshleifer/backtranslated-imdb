Oh my. I decided to go to the cinema with some friends who wanted to see one of the mild, emotional Christmas movies, and I go out of disgust. The movie failed. Fully stop. Paul Giamatti, whom I consider to be a good actor, played his character and rolled terribly alongside Vince Vaughn, who has always been my personal favorite. They are trying to make a Christmas movie a new style. Kind of bad, mixed with good, but it all turned out wrong. The first ten minutes were not so bad, but when we saw santa, it was over. It didn't get any better, the rate remained the same, there was no character development, and certainly one of the worst Christmas films ever invented. Don't look at it, whatever you do.
