I'm very sorry to say this, but "Thunderbirds" doesn't even come up with a high pop, don't even think of any thunder. At one point, I gave serious thought to leaving the cinema, I was in the hope of the movie getting better. I was disappointed, it didn't get any better, it got worse, if at all possible. Had I gone to see the movie with the idea that it should be a "spoof", I would still have been let down. They had an excellent opportunity to make a great film here, they have completely wasted that opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have names associated with this movie and Jonathan Frakes good what can I say he should be embarrassed and not ashamed of the truth. I watched this movie on a pre-release show I had been waiting to see the most eager to have grown up in the sixties with the original shows. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. One last thing I want to say about the movie was the dolls in the TV shows were just a little more wood than where the actors in the movie.
