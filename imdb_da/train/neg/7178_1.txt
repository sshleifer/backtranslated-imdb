Overrated and only for those people in their 20s who have particularly thick rose-colored glasses who never saw it initially because they were young. Awful animation, dialogue and a tired story. A genuine product from the 80s, the new gimmick of a puzzle TOY (that's right, TOY not the absurd, pretentious and child-friendly "collectors action figurine") sold on the back of a bad cartoon and other accessories is only important to them who bought the TOY, as they were "real" children in the period from "84" to "87". It has become cool because the same adults are immature to let go of their memories. Avoid.
