I grew up in the 'Superman II' theater version ("S2T"), and as a child I loved it more than part I, as it not only contained more Superman and three superman-type villains, it started with a bang? ? the best Clark Kent for Superman transformations and rescue scenes. Children should no longer be impatiently waiting for Superman to appear on the screen, as in Part I. Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty has fallen with S2T (See my review.) I have always heard of back story about how they premature and unwarranted fired the director of the original, Richard Donner from part II. (It must have been rare to know that there are two separate films at the same time, now it is common: 'Back to the future' and 'Matrix' 2 and 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Donner Cut ( or "S2RD") I still cannot fully recommend it. Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as it was the wonderful recap of Part I in the S2T's opening. In fact, they all wrote the words: "Earlier on Superman ??" in S2RD. The special effects were not great in either Part I or S2T, but S2RD, they were mostly downright ridiculous ?? as Lois falls from the Daily Planet window. I will admit that some new scenes worked, and some they took out were welcome departures, like any scene in the "honeymoon package". Overall, if you grew up on the S2T as I did, and loved it as a child ?? Not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should definitely see the S2RD as it is almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alarm) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: away was also the strange amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with exactly the same end as 'I.' This is not just a lazy, unoriginal copout, it doesn't make sense why Clark would go back to that dinner if those events never actually happened. And will he continue to "return time" for any confrontation?
