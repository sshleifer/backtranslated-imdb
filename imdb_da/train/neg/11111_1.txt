Don't waste your money on this movie. Don't even go into your car and think you might see this movie if someone else doesn't appeal to you. To watch a movie this weekend, see Batman again. <br /> <br /> Scripture was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Considering: a place in enclosed spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who is able to uncover all the tracks that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add very badly done gore, and what the hell are we doing some freaks in there for a little "spin" to the plot. The play was terrible and the characters incredible - Borat was more credible than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can anyone tell me how a butcher's vest can make a ball ricochet from the person after being shot without making the person who was shot flinch ??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of thing for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I will place it in the agreed decimals to give it the lowest possible score I can.
