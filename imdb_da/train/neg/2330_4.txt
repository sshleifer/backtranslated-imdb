I liked how this started, with some decent special effects especially for a movie 50 years old. There were some beautiful impressive landscapes. The film, however, murders very early with a very stupid dialogue, where the men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius." See this in the 90s after a long absence was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has done mostly TV shows since this movie was released .... and still works. It was also interesting to see a youthful Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams") whom I would not have recognized if it hadn't been for this voice <br /> <br /> I saw half of This movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming, and I had a strong desire to go to bed. I appreciated them doing this VHS tape in stereo again. But it was a weak effort. This is an overrated movie where "elites" think so "heavy" and "thoughtful". It's nonsense. It just seemed "intelligent" because the rest of the 50s sci-fi movies were so stupid! <br /> <br /> Some if the early scenes would have looked good on widescreen, which I did not have at the time of this writing. Maybe another look - this time on the 2.35: 1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review.
