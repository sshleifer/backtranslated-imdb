This is just a joke of a movie, they already lost me in the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills another creature in his cage, this is seen by a scientist working there on a screen and guessing what she is doing, let's go into the cage to check things out, how stupid do these writers say that people have come in the same way as jumping into an aquarium with a big white shark because it ate your goldfish ... Exactly useless and even more stupid. And I don't even want to talk about the cast, because they're not worth doing. why they didn't fire the guy who wrote that immediately is a mystery to me ..... And this kind of stupidity continues the whole movie. Only good thing where it is better than average for these kind of low budget movies. <br /> <br /> If these kinds of things don't bother you, then you go and see it, but be warned if your IQ is over 60 you will probably hate it.
