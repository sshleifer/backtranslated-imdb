I mark this as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments on the content of the show, not on the content itself. <br /> <br /> As I read the comments, it is clear that these Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but despise it while the Democrats seem to enjoy themselves in their so-called truth. Indeed, a reader himself (so it seems) shows that he thinks these events had or could have happened when Bush was in the classroom. <br /> <br /> But as far as the content I see it is trying to be neutral, it is that the group that made this series actually has to be really Bush-haters. In the episode, which I saw last, s02e03, it turned out that the program had been assembled long before McCain became the foremost runner for the nomination; because the other former frontrunners are all highlighted. <br /> <br /> Another thing that got my attention was the use of add-in closets. I thought the series should have been made in Europe, certainly not in the United States, because I know that there is no home in the United States that does not have built-in cupboards, and most likely in the homes of artists. <br /> <As I see the show, yes, I get caught in it, I am amazed to see what a great desire for the authors to do what they can to perpetuate our president. Sure there are problems most Americans will agree on, but that's no reason to be so hateful in public displays that are seen all over the world. Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network, so if Obama or Hillary came in, would they continue to produce and fly the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just comment on the commentator's comments. If some sort of change had taken place in the election back in 2000, he was so sure there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking from his side. Regarding 911 events, I think it was started when Clinton was president, and I can't see if Gore was president, something would be very different.
