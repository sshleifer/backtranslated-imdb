I turn on the 700 Club once for a while and agree only with some of the statements made. I am one of many believers who are considered liberal by most Christians and conservatives of most non-Christians. I agree with my mind, and it is usually not a rep. or them. - I don't think 700 clubs tell people what to believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative backgrounds. I think many people misunderstand what is said about 700 clubs. It bums me out to hear the name call either direction. I think 700 clubs really love Jesus but are so busy trying to make people vote conservatively that they have forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace that Jesus did. Please judge Jesus not based on ignorant people who believe in Him, nor let us be so ignorant of our comments about them. Why are people so meaningful to each other?
