Being a fan of manga and anime from Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to this. I hadn't seen manga or anime, so I had no anticipated performances. Also good. What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to come up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. Although it is tame compared to what is hit in the throat of regular cable viewers (our hero's cheeky bits taste either tastefully behind a strategic glued scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are long-lasting scenes of bondage and torture that lend the case just enough butter to make it unsuitable for the kids. Although I have nothing at all against naked female heroes, I do not like amateurish movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there is at least one amazingly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw. It's no wonder Nagai's TESTICLE BOY has never done it ...
