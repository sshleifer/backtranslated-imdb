This bad remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well and then replaces excitement with confused and meaningless special effects. For example, in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo lie next to each other in two single beds and listen in fear of sounds outside their room. Nell tells Theo to release her hand because she hurts her. Nell looks across Theo, which is several meters away, realizing it was not Theo holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell is alone in bed when she suddenly dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen power to stop pulling her so we realize what has happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's last words mean - "It's about family. It's always been about family"? One redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this can't save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that under her beautiful exterior there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. For example, Zeta-Jones may spell it by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend. Definitely one to be sent to the meaningless remakes cemetery.
