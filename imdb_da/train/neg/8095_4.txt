Wolfe's original novel - in fact, the point of the whole story - is that things are happening because of a carefully calculated appropriateness. The goal is survival within a certain kind of lifestyle. The novel is full of evil. The only thing that emotionally calls true is between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and it's only affected. On the other hand, everyone is out to what he can get in the way of advertising, power, money or self-reinforcement. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for hitting any personality and social segment of New York City. His answer was a negative. After all, he lived in New York and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one wanted on his resume to deny that he didn't like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a PhD in American studies from Yale and is no dummy.) The supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. No one was good. And Sherman McCoy completed bread, a professional protest for social justice. The movie throws it all away and imposes a moral framework on the story that simply doesn't fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Each event was not only possible but thoroughly credible. Wolfe may have made a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to enter a system and records his details. Yes, some of us might have found ourselves as Sherman and his mistress do, stuck in the South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black children, and making an escape after hitting one of them. This scene is nicely transferred from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after that scene, the movie doesn't seem to trust its audience and sometimes gets hectic in its attempt to spell its message, but nebulous is the message. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit a child and be arrested for what he is in the novel, but he would not return to his phenomenally expensive apartment, take a shotgun and start by shooting into the ceiling with what he does in the movement. In what was going to be a fun scene, ceiling gypsies fall over the party guests, and they go away and scream. It simply would not have happened. The film has left the novel's inedible detailed reality in the dust. Wolfe's sensibility, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. What we get instead is a noisy, fantastic and stupid scene that doesn't do anything except wake up the crowd. Similar empty scenes follow and scream for Wolfe's verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> The movie also fails because it puts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" at the opera. We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of these final talks on how we should all begin to behave well again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy end where Sherman goes by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the film as a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head. <br /> <br /> The movie not only makes items that are already trite and unoriginal, it surpasses them as if the audience was unable to absorb subtleties. <br /> <br /> It is not the actor or the direction that is poor. The film is not bad in these respects. And the photography is also quite good, including two pretty spectacular shots - the Gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of Concorde. It is the script that is thoroughly botched. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is pretty much in order and performance. It keeps some of the little details from the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is called Marshall. Who in hell would mention a dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost entirely in the other half, and it is hardly worth seeing. Wolfe's cynical redneck-right-wingism can be offensive to many people, but he has the coonies out of his perceptions. Unfortunately, the authors and producers have not had the courage to pick them up, thereby blowing the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.
