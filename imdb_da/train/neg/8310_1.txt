Another great conspiracy film trying to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) for any disaster since the great flood. Anyone who has ever earned time in the US military can see how fake this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and fashion are all wrong. (And of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminal or total idiots.) Blatant propaganda without attempted objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been disproportionate over recent years. Uses every clich√©, rumors and Urban Legend from the Gulf - all are presented as gospel. (The truth is, no one knows for sure why some GW veterinarians are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new. War is not fun, and I know WWII, Korean and Viet Nam animals with some rather serious ailments too. (And the government is responsible for taking care of all of them.) Sensationist films like this will not solve the problem!
