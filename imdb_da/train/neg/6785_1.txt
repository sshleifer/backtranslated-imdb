> You are warned that this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. great direction the shoots were well thought out. the actors were very good especially Richard pryor tho i would have liked to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classic. Dudley More God bless him could have done better. John Ritter would have wanted to see more of him again. In my view, this failure is entirely due to a writer's error. Perhaps the manufacturer could have pulled the plug when he saw what he was creating. It is just too bad that so much money went into this kettle, as with a slight change here and there I would be corrected. They must have paid the author's standard prices. To produce a chuckle.
