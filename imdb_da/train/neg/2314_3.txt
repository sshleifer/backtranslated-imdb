Plot Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced with an android double, secret service agent Eric Phillips downloads her and reveals a plan from a gun dealer to create an army of invincible androids to murder world leaders. /> <br /> I didn't expect much when I first saw this successor to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker". The movie was nothing special, not to mention a blatant rip-off of both "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with an all-out action sequence opening the movie. There are lots of explosions, heavy shots and a great body posture, just as some martial arts move courtesy of the movie's star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie works like a series of action scenes tied together with minimal plot. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
