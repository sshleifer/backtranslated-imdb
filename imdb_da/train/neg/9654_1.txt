The movie is simply bad. Simply horrible. The string of bad movies from Bollywood has no end! They must run out of excuses to make such horrible films (or not). The problem seems to be with mostly directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have previously proven that they have the ability to deliver great performance ... but they were so badly addressed. The poor script didn't help either. <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan, Om Puri (from whom he ran away 30 years ago and spoke again) meets and everyone About Puri finds out to take care of of his friendship with the salman !!! What a lot of crap. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is totally overlooked for portraying a rockstar. Only saving grace is the good performance in the second half. Ajay shines as his sign shows his dark side. Salman also does this as an addict. <br /> <br /> See it only for the last half hour.
