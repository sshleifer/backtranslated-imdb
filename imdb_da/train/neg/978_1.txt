I've seen this movie recently with my sister who likes the performance of Sophia Loren. I am a person they call a cultural bar. I hate art in any form or form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, killer, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this, avoid this movie like the plague. No door, no action, no nudity, none of that kind. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Each Italian in an apartment block participates in a parade in honor of Hitler, except a housewife, an anti-fascist, and a caretaker. The housewife, cheated by her husband, meets the anti-fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to love him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Despite this, they love each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is expelled by agents. The end. Want an even shorter summary? Drills ... That's probably enough? The guy should have used his gun at the start of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this cruelty. On a side note my sister loved this movie. As I said, I am a cultural barber ...
