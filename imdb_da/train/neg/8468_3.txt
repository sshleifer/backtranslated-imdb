"They are among us" are at best bad science fiction. Mediocre actors in this movie. Plot holes are numerous. Foreigners who somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make them seem human. In their foreign form, they probably have exo-skeletons (that's why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The heroine danger "disappeared" after the Project Blue Book closed, but was apparently an F-16 pilot. And again and again. If you want to see a foreign invasion movie, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and see how it's done right.
