(Honestly, Barbra, I know it's you who clicks on all those "No" s on my review. 22 times? How many people do you need to instruct you to help you here? Don't you have any better?) to do like look at yourself in the mirror all day?) Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best movie I've seen since Citizen Kane". It says pretty much everything - and serves as an expensive warning! What are the ingredients for a movie catastrophe with safe fire and one that will haunt you so you never forget the tears of both laughter and pain? The ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, a musical, feminism, Barbra Streisand's voice, Barbra Streisand's direction and an ultra-corny / idiotic premise. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, so much we know. In fact, almost everyone is ?? Per definition ?? must be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For "art"?!? Well, if you are stupid enough to believe in what they are telling you in their carefully prepared interviews ?? And Streisand has the biggest ego of them all! It's quite an achievement. Being surrounded by narcissistic cretins and yet to cope with them all ?? remarkable. <br /> <br /> The movie, like all its "solo" efforts, is an ego ride right out of hell. Every scene that Streisand is in is automatically destroyed. Stillborn. But since it wasn't enough, she sings a whole lot of Streisandy songs ?? You know the kind that enabled Mariah Carey's, Celine Dions and Whitney Hustons in this world to forgive our precious air waves for decades now. Just for that she does not deserve one, but 100 South Park episodes suck her. <br /> <br /> The principle, Streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi, sounds like a ZAZ comedy. Apart from being a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't look like a woman, nor does she look like a man? in fact, I'm not even sure she's human. The way she looks in this movie, well ?? it cannot be described in words. E. T. looks like a high school jock by comparison. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015. She sees HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me shaking. Especially "Papa, can you hear me help as a demented woman Walrus in warm?" and "In the morning I will prepare the story, YENTL 2: BITCHEN BACK". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand was considering having a nose job early in his career, but changed when they told her, could the voice change? Can you believe it? She should have done it!
