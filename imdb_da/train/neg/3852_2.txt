This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen ?? I don't really know why? Just your past stories of guy getting married and start thinking about someone else. The story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time, when these actors / actresses meet to make a movie that's already made a million times before, is really entertaining. There are usually some wise things in those who are not in anyone else. For some reason, this just doesn't keep your attention. You can choose some fun parts or wise ideas in it, but for some reason they just aren't funny, nor wise in any way ?? I wish I new how to explain it, but I do not ?? Just don't waste your time on this one ??
