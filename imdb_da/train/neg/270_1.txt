I see it now on pink (Serbia TV station) and I have to say that this is a crap. Should I, no action, effects for the sloppy, do I mean who made this series? <br /> <br /> It was a stupid attempt at the studio to make more money on the film's success. OKAY. The movie was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters. I mean, did they actually pay anyone to write it, was it someone in relation to the study? This is not SciFi. <br /> <br /> The movie was the bomb, the series sucked.
