Have I missed something here? This "adaptation" has everything Brookmire's first novel had. Everything except the story, laughs, the black humor, the political intrigue, the characterization, the plot and some sense. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from beginning to end. They made a shame on the plot, they had a romance between Parablane and a policeman, and what was that about? Dr Slaughter was portrayed as a spectator, and who in the hell should Annette Crosby be? <br /> <br /> It looked like they had made a three hour adaptation, so cut it down to 90 minutes. (Although the 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, don't make it to any other Brookmyres book (especially "Blind Land.")
