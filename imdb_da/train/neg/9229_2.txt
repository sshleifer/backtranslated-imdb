This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies can be entertaining, but they need some fabric to do so. It didn't happen here, I'm scared. Sir. Coppola did not inherit his father's abilities, unfortunately (not even his sister, who can, however, make movies as you can see). I wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the leading male actor, probably a director, is as expressive as a frozen octopus, and his voice has the same pitch as he says the leading female actress has an expression on her face , as never changes, the plot is completely segmented into bits with perhaps a single connecting element, the film within the movie idea must be more obsolete than the paleolithic rocks ... would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regretted every single moment I saw this movie. A ride with the dog is far superior to entertainment for this incredibly paralyzed movie. It's like an Fran√ßois Truffaut plot was directed by Dick Cheney ... Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You have to be really fun ...
