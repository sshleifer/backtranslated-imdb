French director Jean Rollin is not exactly known for big movies, and this confusing mess is one of the reasons for that. One of the most confusing things about this production is the title. To a director known to control erotic films about lesbian vampires; You would expect a movie with the word 'naked' in the title to be a particularly harsh but in fact there is not much nudity at all. Instead of erotic lesbian vampires without clothes on; We have a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to lock the secret to immortality, a young woman whose suffering can hold the key and a suicide cult that won't do much. The movie starts promising with a sequence that sees a young girl away by a mysterious mass of people in masks under a young French man's eye, who is also a son of an important man. Through his study, he quickly discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady, and he dives deeper into the cult; he discovers that you can't kill bullets, drink blood and can't go out in daylight ... sounds like a clear cut of vampireism to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> movies, but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so poorly done. It is possible to keep an eye on what is going on, but only because there are so many other films that follow similar plot to it. The director seems to know that he has also shaken up the plot, as climax is basically an excuse to explain the movie to the audience. There is also a twist thrown in the end; but the film would have been better without it. I think it was Jean Rollin's attempt to be a little original, but it comes out as a hamstring attempt on that, rather than a logical continuation of the story. The camera is pretty nice, with lots of plot that takes place in appropriate gothic places. The girls on board fill in what is a beautiful picture, and what Rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency, it is something in style. In the film's defense, it was made in 1969; as something explains the lack of shock, but I can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about what is worth noting.
