This movie is AWFUL! I don't even know where to start, I'm speechless, I can't even describe how terrible this is. The blood is thriving first and foremost, and the play is AWFUL! The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day. This movie was ridiculous, I can't see how it could even get a vote on 1 it's so bad. It seems that it was made by high school students.
