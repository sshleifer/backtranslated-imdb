A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of the Interstate highway in West Texas. And like the landscape in the desert, there is not much to distinguish from it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is transported by two navy escorts this time. No one in the cast is going too well; with this lame script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, won't give much room for this, if he ever writes a memoir, I don't think.
