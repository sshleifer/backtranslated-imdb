I had great hopes for this movie. The theater monologue is fantastic, and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with great experience and knowledge about film. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of many Belgian movies, but this movie is bad. It's amazing that actors who are 34 suddenly play the teenagers' roles. The "language games" were hideous and over the top. Nothing about the movie seemed right to me. The ending was far too much for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half in my life.
