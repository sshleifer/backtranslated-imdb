The guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me, how is it possible that a culture that can produce such a complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single movie that will rise above the despicable garbage game that this movie so perfect represents. This is Bollywood at its best / worst, I can honestly not tell the difference. Qualitatively sweet, kitschy clich√©s at all levels, history line, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To say it all, you have to be a retard to enjoy it. I saw it satisfying my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from it, because I couldn't take it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
