I didn't like this movie at all. For one, I just found the raw and vulgar, for no reason. I also felt it was misogynistic (against women.) It also doesn't seem like the movie is about anything, and I didn't find any of the characters that look like it. It doesn't seem to be a point at all. Maybe I'm missing something, but for me, this movie is pretty much a waste of time, as I could have done something more productive and comfortable. As I use my face as a pin cushion. James Garner is in this thing, like C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. Everything is wasted here and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jennilee Harrison (from the recent years of Three's Company) is also in the movie and it's nice to see her in a non-ditsy role. But apart from that she can't rise above mediocre script. For me, tank is a 3/10
