(Avast, small spoilers in advance) I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I once went to the city of Matewan, West Virginia and in a small museum where I saw the schedule of the city's theater citra May 1954. Movies would change in the theater every day. Since there would be no television in another decade or so in these parts, this was much of the entertainment available in the city. "Raid" seems to have been made for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although not listed in that month, I am sure there was a Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that was probably not too demanding. The historic raid - bold and remarkably successful - did not seem to have been much researched, so the movie is full of Hollywood decorations, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to exercise Liberty Valance. And St. Albans seems to have had several Yankee soldiers coming and going through the city than Washington D.C. had. <br /> <br /> What really made me snicker was when raiders changed their Confederate uniforms. Only in adhesive civil war paintings, Rebel uniforms look so unspoiled. When Anne Bancroft's son catches Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And there is Anne Bancroft himself. While I watched the movie I actually looked at IMDb to see if there was another Anne Bancroft. The Da student actress actress looks nothing like her later films and has none of the presence she would later have in "Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and of course "The Graduate." <br /> worth seeing if only 1). you live in St. Albans and 2). You have a few hours to kill on a Hollywood fictionalisation of your home's biggest news story.
