If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low score 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was entertaining and there are several good things to say about movies. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist James Bishop is awarded the St. Andrews Hospital for his residence and is excited and eager to "change the world". From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is saving a bad truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and not recognize this evil. The story builds pretty well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what patients tell about resident evil, and wonder when and how James will discover this. Also when the break comes, James is in a way chased by evil, and you feel a little excited until the "fight" is over. <br/> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend to the worst possible time and other standard horror items and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> The character building is actually pretty good, you are introduced to most of the people being killed, some of whom you "get to know". <br /> <br /> The movie sets an unpleasant scene, it is also done pretty well. There are mysteries revealed - in an acceptable way. The protagonist, James is very trustworthy - the story of an avid student starting to work is good in this setting. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of "Space 9 from outer space" type bad (evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad actors ( or probably very few take admission) - The main characters sometimes seem bad and sometimes good. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking "I could make a movie like this with my home camera" throughout the movie.
