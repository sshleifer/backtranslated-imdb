Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a final 120-page point-by-point, line-by-line refutation of this mendacious movie, titled A CONVENIENT LIE. The website address where his debunking report called "SKEPTIC'S GUIDE TO AN INCENTIVE TRUTH" can be found at: www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf When you read these demolitions, you will realize that alleged "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than the Y2K scare in 1999, as Gore also approved as he did the pseudo-scientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, which was based on a book written by alleged UFO abducting Whitley Strieber. As James "The Amazing" Randi makes psychologists, and Philip Class makes UFOs, and Gerald Posner makes JFK conspiracy idioci theories, it also does Mario Lewis with Al Gore's movie and all "global warming" scam.
