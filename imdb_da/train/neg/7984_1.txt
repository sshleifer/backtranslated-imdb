Too many secondary plot lines without a primary one. For many hot buttons are pushed for no reason, they managed to spread this boring movie that says nothing, with every drama element out there: death, divorce, money problems, parental problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse adoption, rejected love, travel problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love" ?? You would think it would make for an interesting movie, but hell no ?? All these events are secondary to something primarily that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the movie is a total nonsense. Pity. <br /> <br /> Oh, forgot to mention: The actors, all, are quite good. That was what prevented me from extinguishing it. Too bad their talents were wasted. The film is also well shot: the light, the movement, etc. In each episode - it's all in place. It's just the meaning that is missing.
