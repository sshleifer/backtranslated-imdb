I have no idea what this was shot at, but you can definitely tell that they had no budget. Poor acting, horrible filmography and paralysis and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. The WWF movie movie will make you cry ... where's the stand? The filmmakers went high, but missed a lot of their brand.
