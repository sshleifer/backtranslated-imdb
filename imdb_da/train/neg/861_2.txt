A disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> History established our protagonist like Chrissy, a "young", rather hungry, individually driving, not much. In fact, she does very little to move the story together, so it did not surprise me to see the focus shift on her relatives. It's a shame, but Chrissy seems like an interesting character. The story was predictable and felt quite formulated. So the question now is, when should we see Campion, Jackson and Tamahori's groundbreaking ground with convincing, film-based stories that will inspire instead of entertaining two tolls tolls? <br /> <br /> Technically, a foul shot movie.
