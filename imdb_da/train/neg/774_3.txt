This movie seems to have been made by someone with some good ideas, but who had never made a movie before or had thought that a script should be edited or even fun. When I watched this movie, I saw John Candy and mistakenly assumed that it would be fun. Instead, there was a silly plot of mind control and so many flat, eerie moments. And on top of that, Candy delivered some of the greenest lines I had ever heard until then. So, despite a potentially fun cast and story idea, we are back with an amateurish and raw movie that is likely to be too stupid for the average adult, although teens are likely to find a few laughs. It's really a shame - it could have been so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it should have been wonderful.
