The following are some of the most blaring issues with this movie: 1) Clichés are abundant. Seriously, horrible "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The story jumps around in time, which will be fine if done well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame figures that do not develop so much that they either remain completely static or change drastically for no reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big One: HORRIBLE ACTING. Over the top of almost all people. <br /> <br /> The following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) The management is marvelous looking good. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be in this movie: a) People who can sit through the 90 minute sad simply because the management is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think of themselves, "I like Hollywood killing rife with clichés and overactive, but if I could only see it in Korean ..." There is a lot of good Korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with garbage?
