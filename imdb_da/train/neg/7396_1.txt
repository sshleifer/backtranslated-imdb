Unfortunately, I agree with the critic written by Haloper. <br /> <br /> For a short film, cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else are very, very good. It may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical staff working on this consisted of professionals so the quality can be expected. The problem is, as usual, in the story itself. <br /> <br /> Thing is, it's not really a story. In order to tell a story (or in the case of the movie, VIS a story) you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something, and for some reason he can't get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural unity that observes humanity. That is it. So what we have here is pure exhibition. Instead of being shown a story, we simply learn things about this Tim Watcher person. Of course, considering Tim Watcher's peculiar character and the short film duration, it is of course difficult to give enough background to him, so the movie resorts to Voice-Over Narration. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, which is to provide information that we would never otherwise recover. In fact, if it wasn't for VO, we'd think the sign was just a boiled old man walking around looking at things. To make matters worse, VO also explains what is happening on the screen! The pictures we are shown are just decoration for the text we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I could say that this short movie would make a good video for a band or something, but because the pictures don't stand alone, it's impossible to say it. What is left, of course, has value as a measure of crew's technical abilities (not unbelievable, but good) but fails to entertain, entertain, excitement or at least show a story.
