Only a handful of segments are engaging here. A segment with a wardrobe from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes his point, twisting with twist until the final shot shows things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that few of the clips rely on Paris. The others are then scatter-shot in theme, tone, will and production, which you can also see "Best Advertising of the Year, 2006." It's really everywhere. It does not develop during the running time, and nothing governs the directors. No construction contributes well to the pieces ... tedium inserts. I'm one hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in some stupid, over-commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. It's about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in Antartic. Fantasy shows, I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh thank you, J & E to destroy another movie) and then do too many looks. The point of being in Paris is that you don't have to make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary. Why split it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equal to vampires for some losers? Has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire movie. Every three years we get the same lame vampire clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Making it worse is that the switch from segment to segment is rather artificial. The transitions are lost. This doesn't feel intentional, it feels sloppy.
