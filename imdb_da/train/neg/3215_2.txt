The movie has a nude scene: A man sits on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals tasting dab in the middle of the screen. It's a pretty long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was supposed to be fun, but we saw it with my mother, and it wasn't fun to have that we stared at us, what seemed to be a full minute. The movie is cold. None of the signs are even sympathetic. Audrey Tatou is sweet, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. I really wouldn't recommend this movie. I was expecting to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, trained French family, and he looks down on those figures. <br /> <br />
