I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my faith. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I open to any kind of views or opinions. It doesn't matter to me if Jesus existed as it is written in the Bible. If Mary was a virgin or not, or any other similar pagan concourse. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. What made me angry is when someone takes a sentence, presents it as a fact, but without showing the context it was written. For example, in this movie, the following sentence showed great: "My enemies who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them before me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) What they did not do I tell you is the context. Jesus told a story of an evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! Having quoted the Bible incorrectly, they present us, shout people (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. Most viewers do not check the information provided so they start thinking Jesus = hate = not good for me or for anyone else. These are pure manipulators. Please use your brain. Don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own foundation, our civilization, if we begin to disassemble Jesus in this way and the message He brought to us. You saw the branch you are sitting on.
