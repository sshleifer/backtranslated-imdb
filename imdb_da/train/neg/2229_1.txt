Maybe it's not fair because I only made it about half way through the movie. One of the few films I actually couldn't see because of lameness. The action is horrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a cola deal, coke is just kept in a briefcase - I'm no expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect every time a stroke is thrown (that's the top crunching sound and they use dubbed toy guns in sound effects. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever.
