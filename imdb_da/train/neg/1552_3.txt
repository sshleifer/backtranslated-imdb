This movie was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and have seen examples of this movie for months. Although I was a little skeptical of how much fun this movie would actually be, my friends thought it would be great and hyped me about it. Then I went and saw what I was immersed in my seat of sleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most things in the movie so I wouldn't feel bad and ruin the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my money's worth out of the movie! I always go into an open-minded movie and try not to enter into those with too many expectations, but this movie wasn't that fun. Now it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you haven't seen many previews for the movie, or you like very slow and corny comedies, you can enjoy it, but for true comedy fans, Id says to pass. Maybe look at the Comedy Kings again. Something told me to go see the parents instead !!!
