"Envy" is bad for a number of reasons. Yes, there are odd signs. That's not the problem. It's that they are unlikeable and we don't care about them. "The Rosary" highlighted unlikely signs, but due to proper introductions, we grew to at least be interested in their destiny, while in "Envy" the introduction is thin, the signs are never credible, and the plot only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I am a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller struggled to get this straight-to-video released and now I can see why. The film suggests that he is "best friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we get recordings that suggest Stiller hates Black. I thought this would turn into a kind of one-sided relationship (a la "The Cable Guy"), but it never does, instead of Stiller insisting he is his "best friend" and I felt confused when he seemed to treat black as good "shit." The movie's plot is ridiculous, but it doesn't matter because it should be an exaggerated moral story. Unfortunately, the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives a good performance, but Black is off-key and annoying (and I usually find him very funny). No, it's not a horrible movie, but I still can't believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst movies all the time, but it can Definitely be a lot better. I wish Va-Poo-Rize existed - so we could make this movie disappear forever ...
