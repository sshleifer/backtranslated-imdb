From a poorly constructed plot line that almost doesn't make sense of poor dialogue and conflicting scenes to the ultimate downer, bad action (even Peter Falk can't find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion, like her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single-father Noah, is almost unbearable to see let alone listen to song. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is at best young. <br /> <br /> Every year at this time, I am looking for the TV guides and are eagerly awaiting some of the truly classic Christmas and inspirational holiday movies featured on the small screen. Films like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's lovely "Shop around the corner" and of course the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There are Frank Capra's classics "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Meet John Doe". Hi forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift for you is as counseling. Your time would be better spent searching these movies than finding "Find John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
