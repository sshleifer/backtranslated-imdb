This movie rivals "Plan 9" as one of the stupid movies ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman, and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were western "stunt men". So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here's just an example from the movie: In the movie, the sheriff must witness another city for protection. Of course, the evil guys find out and wait for them. But what happens? The good guys ride together and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad ones, they just sit together on a log, chatting. What's wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I could continue. Maybe this movie was meant as a comedy. If so, it didn't do well either.
