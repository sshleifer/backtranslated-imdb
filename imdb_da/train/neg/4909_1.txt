That's right you've heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books, and I've read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, one should write the actor. <br /> <br /> What right did a film producer have to slaughter a fantastic fiction and make it a mockery of mystery genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter was slaughtered, Michael O'Hara has shown me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only ask that the next scriptwriter tackling this amazing book will do much more justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not quit your daily job.
