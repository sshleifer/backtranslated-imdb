If you thought the original from 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse, more you ask? Well ... at least in the first you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. Except for updated graphics, modern themes (like terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice to Ripley, it's unfortunately the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story went. And for anyone who didn't see the first ... consider yourself lucky that you only saw it once. Maybe for another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
