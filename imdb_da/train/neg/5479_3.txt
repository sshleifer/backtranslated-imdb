I bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary scout expedition to Mexico before they started the Aztecs. Well, he did, because he would never have known about the T Rexs inhabiting a particular valley where the locals honored them as gods. It was understandable. What was not, was the casting of blue eyed Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with the blonde hair that became famous in the Beverly Hills 90210 colored black, Ian looked positively ridiculous. At least he made no attempt at a Spanish accent. The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late in a television series with a one-time position in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of the Dallas PD. He finds true love with an Aztec princess, and life would be just perfect if it were not for the perishable prehistoric animals worshiped by the natives. <br /> <br /> The Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some outbreaks from the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series The Lost Land. All that was needed was that some Sleestak should be seen. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in finding out about this reconnoiteration expedition that didn't quite make history books, then check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca. So try to sit through it with a straight face.
