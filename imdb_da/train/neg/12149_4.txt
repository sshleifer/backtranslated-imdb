Set in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses is seeking a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, it could be used for how the United States is trying to control the media in the Iraq war, but it ends up feeling hollow. There is never any real excitement in history, and the actor is never so good. Worst, the movie's direction is horrible, focus more on odd camera angles that don't convey anything beyond "Isn't it a strange way to keep the camera on." Special effects are pretty bad ... at some point, video of an explosion is green screened over the city, and at best, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie has a couple of bright spots ... namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a pickup service and a party shuttle). But it is far too little to make the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value, but there is much more humor, humor and talent behind it.
