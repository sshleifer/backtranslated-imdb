Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects had been amazing. Better governance may have got a little more feeling and better performances from the actors. But nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have corrected it. Plot holes, bad lines, horrible pacing, endless playback of the same images of a CGI dragon stomping through times ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
