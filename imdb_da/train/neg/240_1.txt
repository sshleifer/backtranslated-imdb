I never want to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to get really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with cheesy wedding video. Vivah is so cheesy that Badjatyas has left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There wasn't a moment in the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good '. Aloknath makes clich√© in a role as Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster besides ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous staples, experimental hard-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Now the spokesman warns you about what is happening in all his other films after a calamitous incident movie ends with a happy note.
