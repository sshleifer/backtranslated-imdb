The reason was boring, the girls were sick and the supposed Italian male leader had obviously never heard an Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this movie, but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There was literally no filthy feature about this movie. I think this is a cemetery for actors who will never work again with the unfortunate exception of Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no appreciable reason. <br /> <br /> I hope Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment industry. They have no place in it.
