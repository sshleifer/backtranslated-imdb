For months prior to the release of this movie, you saw it advertised in every possible print media, so I waited patiently for his video release to see what the whole hype was about. After that was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for recording the video recorder for the last one and a half hours to watch such a horrible movie. Essentially, it fails because it is a character-based film about unfinished characters. With the possible exception for Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you can't stand any of them. The film is dependent on its dialogue that is sophomoric, moronic and crude. The only slightly entertaining character is Eric, whose depiction of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The last twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of anger against Peet. All in all, only rent if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
