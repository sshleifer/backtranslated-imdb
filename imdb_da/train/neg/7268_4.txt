Drilling, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved ?? this step felt like a bad date. Worse, the dull art school direction - with a heavy use of the swirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up? - Constantly warn to be noticed. Add the thinnest of plots and almost no dialogue, and the movie begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes into. It gets worse: instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-overs AND quotes and songs that comment too clearly on the characters. Really high opera music too. Blame everything on the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all pretty good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is especially suitable for film studios. He and the other actors have some sore erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes, and you wonder if the instructor is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn job. The amazing college campus architecture that somewhere in Mexico City is inspiring. How will universities in the United States be so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. Do you want to use the quick scan button ?? a lot.
