I never expect a movie adaptation to be too close to the novel (especially a loved one as the evening), but when I saw that the book's author, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive producer on the movie, I thought that the evening would be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you've had the book, don't bother with this movie. It is so far away from the book that the two hardly have any similarity to each other. Here are our characters quite different: The bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the son of the housekeeper. Buddy is a drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen; Oh, it just gets worst with every moment. <br /> <br /> And truly, we didn't learn from the Bridges of Madison County to cut off the story we're supposed to be excited about until scenes of our heroes' adult children have unpleasant and youthful battles, simply don't work on movies ? This movie is a disaster. Skip it over.
