I really tried to like this movie. When I see it, all I can think is "This guy gives me the creeps, I would have got a detention order". It also calls CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really a conversation before you made the movie? "Let's make a movie that puts two chronically depressed, socially inactive people into a relationship that immerses their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their life is!" From what I have seen in life, the last thing on earth, we find attractive in a potential mate, constantly self-pity. <br /> <br /> The movie's mood is clearly 80-ish; brooding and slow. Don't make me wrong, the movie has its moments, only very few of them.
