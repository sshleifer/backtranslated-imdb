Shame really - very rarely do I see a movie and are left to feel disappointed at the end. I've seen a few of Ira Levin's adaptations - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and liked both of them, but it just wasn't something I appealed to. <br /> <br /> When I read the plot outline - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and steel his script for his own success - I was thrilled. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but all I mean is there are loads of twists. So many people find it difficult to explain the movie's plot line in detail without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before the twists began to occur and at that time my interest and enjoyment began to fade. Although I have to give Lumet the credit for the very entertaining end that made me laugh aloud. <br /> <br /> The lead role - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Though Worth's obvious fake Russian accent got a bit on my nerves (no personal Irene, I think every actor's false accent would annoy me). Not sure if Canon's character was supposed to be annoyingly fun, but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this - I don't want you to be turned off to see this because of my views - give it a try, you like it, you can't. It's just about meaning.
