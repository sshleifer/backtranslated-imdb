Alas, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS VERSION SUCKS! I don't know which of all people put the money for this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and made it the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is quite literally so bad that even the presence of a great thespian like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save it. This film is only redeemable quality that it made good feed for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with this one. <br /> <br /> But in any way I'm sure Shakespeare, if he had lived it, wouldn't have wished his name was associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not even so bad, it is good; It's just pretty bad. Absolutely terrible.
