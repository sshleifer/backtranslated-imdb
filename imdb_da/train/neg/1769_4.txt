1. watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many weird and weird elements that you start laughing at the extreme shame about 3/4 way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult feeling for King fans. It is the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers (a body-changing cat-like, meat-eating, life-needs, near-extinct humanoid race), moving from city to city after virgins to keep alive. They come across as quite a normal class of people, unless they are secret lovers, and cats hang outside their homes, day and night. Cats are fatal to them, so they trap their farms to try to keep the population down. We'll see them breaking a couple of their necks when they attack (which is also the first in my movie experience) --- hopefully no real cats were hurt in the movie. The boy is after a sweet girl that he is in love until he becomes a "sleepwalker" and then he just wants his body. There is so much campy unique in this movie that it could have been better if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life, but the director instead tries to scare you every few minutes until you want him to just come over it and bring gore out. Eventually it happens and the movie wins down to the typical Stephen King downbeat ending. The movie is interesting because the king's humor comes through more than usual, but his amusement is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will likely suffer and should have in their collection, but as a valuable movie experience does it Don't really cut it.
