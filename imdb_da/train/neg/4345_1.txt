Misleading advertising ... I saw an advertisement for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power called "From Scarface and Carlito's Way" LETS GET IT REALLY ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, he was actually the editing assistant for Scarface . Not to take away from Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he should have a little more class. I think I can speak to the masses when I say ... We hate to be blatantly lied to. As far as the film goes, it was bad at best. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work on this movie. Overall, this film did not do a good job of filling out the subjects of Carlito's Way. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to make a quick money rather a good movie.
