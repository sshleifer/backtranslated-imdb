After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen of Nerve. During this first year of filming, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, shooting, etc. This is done on a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is also with his friend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of both his and Mabel's friends. He moves Mabel in the stands without any consequences from his behavior. Lots of slapstick here, but there is little else to recommend this movie to others, so Chaplin develops. The print I saw was seriously aggravated, which may have affected its enjoyment. Charley Chase can smile. * of 4 stars.
