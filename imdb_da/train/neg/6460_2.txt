* Can anyone tell me where is COMEDY ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (with him!) and the whole thing is so thick! <br /> <br /> * They were trying to make a live cartoon that turned out to be super-bloody comic nightmare and wasn't it even fun? Like the plan scene in the bathroom; it was so good with its cinematic imagination, but there is nothing more .. except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * This is actually a kind of work that they did just to do it and make some money from it, but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed by ourselves, as was deceived by such low artwork and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all! It would have been more ugly if it was great production and starring Brando in his golden years with a real star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family in here. Just be aware of it! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who admired this movie or good-forbid-love it! Then go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt someone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the movie is not! And he didn't intend to be in here after reading this for sure !! But the biggest big problem is that no one else has ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a little bit clever or even good !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The movie's torture is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) frames (Mira Sorvino) at her shoes! It was so realistic !? Maybe he saw himself in her, so he punished himself for being in such a shit! <br /> <br /> * For Billion Time: This could have been better (or less worse!). The scripture, until the train's hoist, was lovely, and I just imagined that they would escape to have any hunt as if it were another (Smokey and Bandit) but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, some of these chimeras were very merciful than what I have seen! <br /> <br /> * Why didn't this masterpiece receive any Razzie award ?! Do you want me to think that there were less movies than this? I do not think ! It is a situation where Razzie's supervisor must win one for his negligence! <br /> <br /> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * And why? Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate comics, was not as good as the ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, no .. It's a horror !! and I just hate horror movies, especially those that have been propagated as comic ones! <br /> <br /> * Name good about it? Hmmm! Well, one compared to another Marlon Brando's monster movie (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what's or who's just the bad, the ugly and the very ugly in this movie .. Just ask your last prayers and go and see it .. Must God Help You!
