There are some great philosophical questions. What's the meaning of life? What happens when we die? And why do they make movies here? The premise is absurd. Thre-action is one-dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is an infinite weapon battle among some of the sunniest shots Hollywood has ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everyone would have died in the first five minutes, and there would be no movie. It was too bad that it didn't happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times, I'm stuck with it to see just how bad it could be. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) The last line is the curvy stupidity of the whole dopey, gloomy scenario. It is not even worth the second status status at a third rate drive-in in the off season. Apart from the general horror of the film, I am deeply concerned about its influence on young audiences. The Americans creep out as such and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly the banal cinema on the Brobdingnagian scale!
