The reason does not give rise to new tensions, it even starts the same as cube I. This time, there are no other improvements for the cube machines, except for having an extra outlet which is not guarded, very ingenious. The signs are not as well elaborated as in the first episode, they just became "flat" as in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> If anyone makes it to the normal exit, the person will be asked some questions that "do you believe in God?", it is not really creative or original and, in my opinion, it does not fit in properly in the mystery of the dice with that traps. There really is nothing else to say about it.
