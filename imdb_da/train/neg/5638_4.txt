Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy warfare between the happy couple, the exotic model of the delicacy and old-fashioned motel that was (it would have turned out to be) secretly seen from the forest and had been the aging child of the guys when they shared the rubber house. <br /> <br /> In that process, they could have blown the freezer hood for smiths, most of them solved at night; such as. "hear the bitch" on the windshield, the reason why the protagonist had "no friends", and explain his coolness under pressure from bloody tampons, incessant phone calls. . . and the manger-seat chic, the green thumb and his attraction to the simpler life. Completely technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue companion? A little heartbeat would have been nice. It was fun to see these people moving around, but I think, but Eleanora's stupid Italian game was stiflingly stereotypical, while the caretaker had been too many yoga courses: a cock, a mind, and a pick-up truck about him. I also wanted them to have got a little more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear in her bare red suitcase, and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel. <br /> <br /> Trifling matters, you can say that. I agree, although the niggling bits have not just put up in this rush job. Good Wars, though, and I felt really cold all the way through.
