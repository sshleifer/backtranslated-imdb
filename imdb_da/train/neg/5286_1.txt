I'm a big Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could see it without waiting forever to come to the US. I really should have saved my money. What about Anne running after Wentworth? The whole point at Anne Elliot is that she was quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Maria, did she suffer from a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, nor did she walk normally. There was no chemistry between the two main characters who made their whole "romance" absolutely incredible. In the final scene, they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes do not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not see the 1995 version, which, although lacking, remained quite close to the book. The book, I don't even think they read it. It's a bit like a Cliff's Notes movie about persuasion. Hit all the high points without explaining anything.
