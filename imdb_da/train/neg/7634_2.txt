This is the kind of movie that shows the French bio's cheek when it comes to creating thrillers. The conductor's desire for "sound american" is so brilliant that you won't be fooling for a moment unless you haven't seen a serial killer movie since "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two male police (or one and a half, more like, as you will see), horrible murders, a plot more complicated than complex. Charlie's Berling has no luck with the genre (see the amazing stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago). Staged with his pregnant wife - who must be the equivalent of the rest of the plot - is among the worst ever filmed. Add a steaming love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thereby attract the great teens audience. A violent and absurd conclusion followed by a quiet epilogue that could make a nice commercial for the CÃ´te d'azur, It is really the silence of silence.
