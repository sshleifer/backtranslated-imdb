Steve McQueen certainly has a lot of loyal fans out there. He was certainly a charismatic guy, one of the most charismatic big screens ever knew. But even McQueen can't save this turkey from a movie shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual places of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new child without a criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gangs. There is more than one broad indication that there is a homosexual relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He is not at all happy with the other heist members, primarily because of his lack of criminal resumption. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a friend in Molly McCarthy, and she suspects something, especially when he starts hanging out with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all the most beautiful characters. It would definitely get my suspicions awakened. <br /> <br /> The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim mostly did documentaries, and Stix didn't do much of anything. One of the two jokers decided that Steve's performance was best earned by making a bad Marlon Brando imitation. <br /> <br /> This movie can go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can't believe they would have if they saw this. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except dressing for this turkey.
