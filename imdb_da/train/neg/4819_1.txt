This is a typical low budget 1970s mess. It was supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the Indians to the cynical cowboy. The story and the story is a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of bigfoot footage - continue jumping. There won't be much and what can you do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; It would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I don't like the 1970's low price fare; I do. It's that this is such a mess of bad plays, bad characters, miserable history and no excitement that you just can't enjoy it. It does not fit in with the "so bad, good" category, nor can you laugh at how bad it is without the help of illegal drugs. It is mostly many boring pictures of the people camping, hiking, riding horses, and watching wild life. There is a bigfoot attack that is totally silly; apparently our friend Sasquatch throws down the campers from above while they shoot their rifles back on him. At that time, you kill heavily for bigfoot to drop some stones on the heads of the filmmakers and stop it all.
