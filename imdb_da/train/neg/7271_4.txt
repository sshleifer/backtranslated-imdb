This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind given its epic length, but instead it met itself by being a big chain of empty episodes where nothing is happening. The characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in history (there is actually no history) than looking at each other and kissing. It's a shame that an interesting aesthetic suggestion like having virtually no dialogue is completely wasted in a movie than not doing something by examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieving true emotional resonance. Besides that, it pretends to be an "art" movie using the worst naive clich√©s of the cinematic snobbery. But anyway, if anyone can identify with his great banality, I think that's fine.
