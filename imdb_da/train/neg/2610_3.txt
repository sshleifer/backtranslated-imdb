102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous installment, and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, silly padded story, horrible about acting by Glenn Close, who hams each scene as if she is playing for her own amusement and incredibly boring and uninteresting main players. Once again, the dogs are the only "actors" who seem "right" and that is a stretch. Another wasted effort here. GRADE: D
