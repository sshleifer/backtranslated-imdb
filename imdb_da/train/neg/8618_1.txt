Incredibly horrible movie. I have seen part of this on T.V. recently. My jaw fell when I saw a terribly conceived plot and listened to the mind-numbing drive. Not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing something similar to a chuckle. It was so bad, it made me explode Rodney Dangerfield's body, let him go around and scream: "How could you?" I know many movies are finished in haste, hoping to redeem the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It is sad and scary that people are expected to pay to see such tripe. The bottom of the cesspool, even by Sunday afternoon TV standards.
