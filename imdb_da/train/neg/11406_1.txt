But I came across it. For me it seemed that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I felt so sad about the character of Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau, who was evil, I just felt that the comparison was a little hard and unrealistic. The movie was really bad though. I wouldn't see it unless you're ready for a big disappointment.
