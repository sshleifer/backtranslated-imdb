The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a mark given to the senator who claimed the public's ignorance of World War II aircraft. The rearward-facing weapons invoked a lock that would prevent the rear fighter from shooting the tail of the air by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed to the tail. When the senator practiced on the ground one day, he managed to shoot away from the plane's tail. He could not have done it if the gun was properly adjusted. Gunnery officer in charge of it publicly admitted before a camera that he was responsible - he had made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact shows how unilateral it is. This film was designed to do one thing, destroying the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was PBS specially made on him. He was a hard-working, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages of rising to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting the tail out of a plane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie is because the public likes simple stories, one-sided stories so they don't have to think.
