As low budget indies go, you will usually find out that you get what you pay for and let me just say I didn't pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Author / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the avenged spirit of a beaten serial killer. Not a bad assumption, but fulfilled with a low budget budget. The camera's work is trying to be too cumbersome for its audience by constantly using appallingly quick cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. This is evident just outside the bat, which we are introduced to the wild killer, and soon realizes that it (actor) is the frightening thing that happens ... After a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the action remains the same. "Frightworld" creates some rather unique cinematographs when viewing scenes from inside the house, but with extremely long playing times it cannot save the movie from the below average indie hell. <br /> <br /> There are some mediocre nudity, but not much to do, which is usually the pleasure of these types of movies. Fans of really bad B-movies can find something of interest here, otherwise don't spend a lot of money.
