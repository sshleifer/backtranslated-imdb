A skilled actress could have pulled it out after the love scene, where things immediately nosedive into the soap dish. <br /> <br /> You can't help feeling good at Mulroney ... you can read it in his face as he looks through all this. He's got the whole respect for life. This time he tastes one on the warning track, and no one can figure out what to do when he is having fun at home.
