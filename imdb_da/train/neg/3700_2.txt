Because that's the only way you don't think this movie is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which at least was worth seeing) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It is more a means of giving Rock some time to movies for weak stand up comedy that doesn't play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes generally have to be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but turns out to come from Rock himself. As he insults black and white, chemistry is all wrong. The movie is not fun, badly shot, the play is at best weak. Go rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live Rock video and you will be ahead of the game.
