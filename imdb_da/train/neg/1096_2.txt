While some scenes of training were realistic, many of them showed military instructors like ex-Nazi types. Of course, the people who wrote the screen were either anti-military types or wrote a movie to that audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnamese veterinarian, and even during this period, military instructors who appeared in how some of them did probably still earn time in military prison. <br /> <br /> And I really loved the scene where the "deer" and his buddy (both private individuals) sit down in the captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their friend. This kind of thing has never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the point of the scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, I asked myself, "What was this movie about?" as it seemed to wander around without focus, unless "I hate all authority." Thank God, I got it from the library and didn't pay to rent it.
