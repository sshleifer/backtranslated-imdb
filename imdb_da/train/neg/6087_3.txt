This movie was almost not as much of a task as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia party. Most of the actors are mediocre, but rather typical of the 1970s stuff fills with pregnant breaks. A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the forest and immediately become the victim of these same goings-on. Floating plates are spotted, more people disappearing - but are foreigners or our own government's ultra-secret group of hedgehogs? Soon, a reporter and an "ufologist" (apparently modeled on the nature of the authorship) are drawn into this raging failure and become the target of ultra-secret agents who are so threatening as they are unlikely and unclear. So the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> The film probably predicts that it is as sensuous as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be praised for taking it so seriously. The camera work is okay for a low budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the manuscript is stupid and absurd, and there are continuity issues that are fun to watch out for. What are the few seconds of shine I mentioned? Honestly, I can't say much to you without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the movie is at least worth forwarding to if you can't take the middle.
