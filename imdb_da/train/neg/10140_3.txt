This movie should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What a shame about the budget. <br /> <br /> You have to hire convincing actors and make a real movie. Very thin plot and convincing lines. Almost fun, and it's a shame for an action movie .... Definitely not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> They continue to play the same "shots" of a Stealth airplane flying away. You've seen it and it wasn't worth driving 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from filmmaking. <br /> <br /> His movie gets worse every time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
