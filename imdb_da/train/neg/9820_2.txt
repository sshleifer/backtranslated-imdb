I'm glad some people liked this, but I hated this movie. It had a very good idea for a story line, but it was here where it ended. It was poorly written, badly acted and poorly made. <br /> <br /> It had some interesting plot points, but they just ran too fast, the authors needed to realize what to hold on and expand on those bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and dunk drossen. Instead, it was "what happens?", 5 seconds later they tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie had no excitement and I was bored from start to finish. I just wanted to finish it. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misery, or best-planned plans, if you want tensions or twists that keep you guessing at the end.
