Undeveloped / incredible story line (when I looked out where it was going, I didn't care anymore) bad casting. (Come on ... William Macy as a hitman ???) Bad conducting ever seen Tracey Ullman perform so badly?) (Should I like what happened to the unethical incompetent, eerie John Ritter character?) Bad script. .. (Really, I'm not looking for a formal script, but it was really terrible) the only really good thing about it was the child. Ten lines? It's not OK if your comment is less than ten lines? COme on-- whose rules are they? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ??? Isn't that kind of arbitrary? Why is it not ok to have less than 10 lines of comment?
