I don't know what the other guys are watching Steven Seagal movies for, but I see them because those who are always stupid as they are, are always good at laughing. Why would you rate this movie a 1 in 10 based on dubbing when that kind of thing is what makes a movie like this a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of? <br /> <br /> The Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt it was just as worthy of a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other films; In fact, I didn't think it was one of his worst at a long shot. It mostly had a half-way coherent plot line, and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting. The end really sucked, but even that had some cozy blur. In the end, the story didn't deliver what it promised, but I actually thought the play, the characterization (if I could use such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself was exactly the stone-assembled, nonsense man we have come to expect, and the rest of the cast supported him quite well without ever having risen from him. This, people, is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Deal with it. Or better yet: laugh it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
