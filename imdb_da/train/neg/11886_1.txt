Watching Josh Kornbluth 'act' in this movie reminds me of my freshman television production class, where "no fun" had the chance to prove how unfunny they really were! <br /> <br /> OBVIOUS is the word that will remember when I try to sync this wannabe comedy. The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is painfully poor. OUCH!!!!!!! Scripture is simply dorkish. It's akin to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour Saturday Night Live shit (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and want my money back !!!
