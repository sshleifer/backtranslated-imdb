This movie really deserves the MST3K treatment. A pseudo-old fantasy hack-n-slash tale with two barbaric brothers with a collective IQ of hot water, sign names apparently derived from a Mad Libs book and such classic lines as "Keep her and uncover her stomach!" Barbarians cross into "so bad, it's good" area.
