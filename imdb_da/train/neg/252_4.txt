Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a beautiful but insignificant adaptation, where the dialogue seems recited rather than deep-hearted, and the tense look of the ghosts fails to round any kind of awe or magic. Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, angles around the stilts and seems to make an impression of Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is angry, and he never seems to really believe what deprives him of his performance of its effect. The scenes where he has shown his past have as much influence as if he half-heartedly flicked through his family album. No one else seems to put any effort into it except Frank Finlay, who is chronically overbearing.
