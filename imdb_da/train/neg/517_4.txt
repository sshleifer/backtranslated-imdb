"The Return of Chandu" is remarkable if you can say so, to cast Bela Lugosi as the hero instead of the villain. Why does he even get the girl. The story as such implies that Ubasti's Black Magic Cult tries to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the glorious Maria Alba) and use her as a sacrifice as a means to revive their old leader who just happens to look like Nadji. Lugosi like Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to counter the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive inventory. Fans of King Kong (1933) recognize the large doors used to keep King in bay in several stages. The play is mostly terrible. For example, the actor who plays the high priest (I think Lucien Prival) uses the acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies. The less said about the others the better. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts of independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time. Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl, who knows it. When his career began to spiral downwards in the late 30s, this kind of ticket would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
