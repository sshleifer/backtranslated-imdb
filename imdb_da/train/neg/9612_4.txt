Until the end, the bad ones have always been - what kind of questioning the good guys. A couple of innocent-man-accused-of-a-crime plots are annoying. Some unnecessary dialogues where various boring legal issues are discussed. This is just a mediocre stupid old western, so what is this nonsense about trying to keep things "realistic"? Cagney's atypical presence in a Western is one of the few - if not the only - entertaining things about the movie. Somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal; kind of like "Where's the child hiding? Where's he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, will you marry me?"
