I had been exposed to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As it was stated, it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Although it tries to be original by focusing on the teenage father instead of the mother, showing the problems father would go through. It had an interesting side to it, but it just doesn't live up to its originality because nothing else in this movie was original. We have the protagonist, who has the older sister who likes any other movie like this, has something against him. We have the stay at home mother who expects too much, and when he gives more, she feels offended and leaves him in the dust so we have the father who is always gone. Then the girls' side has the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all, she does. On the story, as I said, it was interesting, but the lack of good action from the whole cast and the lack of good writing or storytelling. Everything about this fell into clich√©, the little nerd child in school starts studying with girl they meet, have sex and then boom, we have a small child. Perhaps it could have been better if the writing had improved, and if the play had improved, I seriously got more feelings out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this movie and it is pretty bad to see as Leatherface film is bad and horridly acted. So far, the only interesting teenage pregnancy movie I've seen is Juno. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while giving the same message. As I said, the idea was original, most of these films focused on the teenage mother, but this one did not instead focus on the father's drama, but again the original does not store this movie from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to either recreate this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar movie because it was wasted potential.
