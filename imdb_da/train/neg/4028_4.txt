This had all the possibilities for a very good movie - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (mystical missile from space threatens to burn up on the planet) and lots of recordings (if the air force had movies of jet shooting rockets, it was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The movie relates to a missile from space attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently redirected to a low atmospheric circuit. In under five miles and at a speed of more than 4,000 miles, it emits one million-degree exhaust that burns everything on the ground, including glaciers, distant Early Warning (DEW) line bases and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Any attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first mistakes in this movie are seen early. While we do not expect much from low-budget films, some things cannot be forgotten - as little research. For example, both the Soviets and the American fire anti-ballistic missiles at home on the missile with infinite accuracy. However, the first successful ABM tests were not completed until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with almost as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character is crying and boo-hoos at the victim's victim as if she were on a screen test. The Loggia is about as heroic as a boring businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) raises it so much that he makes William Shatner a thespian. A bus driver spits out throughout the world in scene after stage. The only good actor is the movie narrator, played by veteran character Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). All this could be overlooked if it wasn't the timeline. After the missile's info is sent to DC, the Pentagon enters a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. After that, there are discussions of scientists and there is a deadly wheat when a word from ambassadors is sought to see if the missile is an attack by the Russians and if an answer is necessary. <br /> <br /> The film showing military is being completely distorted. Civil defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people scramble to dropouts while school buses pick up millions of kids (and we're going to see the whitest New York City I've ever seen, though it looks like 50-sci-fi movies have shown this to be standard). The press is held in the dark for many minutes. So amazing, a man at the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa, Canada for 51 minutes! All of the above actions happened in 12 minutes! So, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks in a way to stop foreign missiles. He produces a caseload of plutonium slowly, puts it in a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to put it on a missile. Along the way he is knocked off the road by a wild driver, breaks down and then carjacked. He finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to slow down the missile. Again, all this in the same 63-minute timeframe. The movie also annoys the viewer by making it seem as if Ottawa could be saved, only to show men, women and children are being burned. The missile is said to have five minutes to reach New York. The loggia still runs to the base (4 miles more). He comes to the base and reinforces the missile, a two-minute countdown is then announced. All within five minutes. The cities of New York should have been at least burned. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you haven't guessed it, the missile will be destroyed. ABM warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear weapon. Five seconds later, the explosion spread and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear weapon equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York City, and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The movie had all the elements needed to be a good B movie but wasted them. Loggia played its character so noisy that you did not tend to sacrifice itself in the end. You didn't care about the other characters, not even the smart scientist who played Pine. The excitement that should have moved the movie together was not physically possible in the allowed timeline (it would still not be today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been reissued in any medium and for good reason. I don't know if the movie was going to be, or if it was standard practice, but there is a scene where the government sends all the best scientists, military men and businessmen to deep gazebos and says they're too valuable to lose. There is not a single woman or minority in the pile. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the movie, and for a short while he gets to play a piano. It was worse than "27 days", where a foreigner gives five landlords a chance to either save or destroy the planet, and he does not include any black or hispanics. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a special night at Turner Classic Movies, and I don't expect it to come up again. If you find a copy of this somewhere, you may be able to set it up on Amazon.com.
