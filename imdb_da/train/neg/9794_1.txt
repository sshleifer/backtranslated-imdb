I really have no idea why some people find the power rangers TV show even externally interesting at all. The costumes are quite ridiculous, and the people playing in them also look quite stupid at the same time. There is absolutely something distant about power rangers. This is only a higher priced TV commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic waste to unsuspecting children around the world. From the notes I can see that it has been banned in New Zealand, and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's horrible and ridiculous.
