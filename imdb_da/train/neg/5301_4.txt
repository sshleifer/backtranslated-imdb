I bought this movie because this was Shah Rukh Khan's Debut. And I also liked to see how he would do. I must say he is excellent in his role. Divya Bharathi is amazing in this movie. Rishi does a wonderful job. Susham Seth is well supported.Alok nath was good in his role. Amrish and Mohnish also made their parts good. The direction is average. Editing is poor. The story is boring. It tells us about Ravi, a famous pop singer. He has many female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaajal becomes a widow. To escape from Ravi's cousins. They go to Bombay. She comes across Raja. She falls in love with him and gets married. Ravi back. The story is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half runs. It also draws a lot. But it is hidden by the actors and the music. The other half is entertained. The music is captivating with some fine songs. The kinematics looks obsolete in the first half, but it looks imaginative. The song pictures are boring except "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and a rain song. The costumes are outdated. Any way to see this just for actors and music Appreciation-4/10
