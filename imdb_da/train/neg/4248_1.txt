This film had mediocrity, laziness and thoughtlessness written over it. If you are going to make a movie about vampires that have been made thousands of times already, then you better do a good job. I will be the first to say that this movie just doesn't cut it. Some scary / horror movies just fail to break the shape of "Let's do something banned and abandoned for fun because all stories are just lies" clich√©. This one was unfortunately no different, and like all scary movies when you wake up that road, no one is left. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the heroes do the same job over and over in the whole movie, but so mysteriously are they wrapped up at the moment and can't do the job at last? The end was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 that I will never see. Horrible movie.
