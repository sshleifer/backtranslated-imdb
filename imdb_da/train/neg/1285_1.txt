Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was appalled by this vile portrayal of a man who was no more or less than a nephew. Even worse, the thread throughout the film was sex in some form, implicit or verbal. To see it, one would think that Scotland from the 18th century was populated by a bunch of sex girls and homosexuals. Lange was a joke that served as the "young" mother at the age of 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a bath in a Scottish loch is not common when portraying him - but it gave them another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were. Save your money and see Pinnochio.
