As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield, it was a horrible movie. The reason was a bit of a holistic rip off of various movies, but unfortunately they forgot to tear off any good jokes. In addition, it was annoying and boring and it was friendly. If you're looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of Private Parts.
