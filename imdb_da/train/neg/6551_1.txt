A study in bad. Bad plays, bad music, bad acting, poor editing, poor direction and a bad idea. Pieces of schlock come no cheesier or accidentally more fun than this ... stuff. At the end of "movie", you are left over why they break in the first place. Bad Malcolm McDowell, was he short of money or something? Still thinking about seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, then you'll see the cyborg-populated city called "Cytown". Avoid this, my film-cutting friends. Avoid.
