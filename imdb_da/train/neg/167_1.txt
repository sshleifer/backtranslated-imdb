Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about history, should be embarrassed by this series. Borg does not come around until Q brings the company to the Gamma sector, Klingons are never seen before Kirk meets them. NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to bear the name of the company .... should I continue? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in each episode of the star trek until this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Bad Bakula. He is a great actor, just as everything is thrown. I like them all, but the story is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the reviews. I think more people saw Deep Space 9 (which was prematurely canceled).
