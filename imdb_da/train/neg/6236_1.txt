This movie was the most unruly and liberally fed movie I've ever seen in my life. (In addition to Farenheit 9/11). All the information was only supported by the opinion of FEM researchers, while 80% of the Asssociated Press strongly criticized the science promoted as Gore. Global Warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was all wrong. This film has been investigated over and over, and it has proved to be evidence that the evidence is that its lies were nothing but lies. <br /> <br /> LIBERAL BLINDNESS! One to think that they show it in school shows that the media have brainwashed us to believe in this waste!
