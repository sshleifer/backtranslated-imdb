"This could mean the end of the white race!" gasps a general like a dozen Native Zombies roam the battlefields in Europe under the "Great War". An expedition sets off the slow, back-projected town of Kennif-Angor to stop this kind of thing and keep the battlefields ready for decent, honest white people to be slaughtered by tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It is a little difficult to tell when people are zombies or not in this movie, as the actor is so wood. Even at 1936 standards appearances in this movie are poor. From a previous decade. It seems that it came out of a correspondence book about how to act. <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions ------- ------ <br /> <br /> "How to Express Fear and disgust (Woman) Squeeze both fists Place the fist off one hand on the heart Open the mouth as if screaming Place the second fist palm out against the mouth Hold the bag for 10 seconds longer than comfortable, then turn the head 90 degrees away from the direction of despised object and sob. "<br /> <br />" How you have a hard, highly emotional scene with ex-fianc√© explain your love for someone else. Do NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotion. Do not move your eyes too much while reading your lines out of the wall. "<br /> To give us a breather from the lead, the instructor is cunningly managing for long breaks, where Not much happens, except that movies continue through the projectors. Thus, 35 minutes of history is worth upholstered for up to 60 hours. <br /> <br /> The uprising in the zombies when it comes is so slow! Turned out of mental bondage, the arms of ex-zombiefied minions are put on their former master by amble slowly up the hill and then sort a door a little and smash a window. "Yes ... let us ... oh, I dunnno yes. Let's get him grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (Although I have just found a little hidden symbolism. Jagger is shot by a native as a kind of ironic counterweight to all the natives shot by the Germans at the beginning of the girl. See, even depressed natives will not have the end of the white race!) Chase (it can be called it) through the backward swamp is fun and worth the price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a hell of time renting it up but is totally wasted as Col. Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moment in this movie. A nice little montage of the zombies native and white cast members who fall under the evil eyes spelling. face-to-face, plywood into each other. It works, though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up that a frame has been cut. I suppose these should be Neg Cutters frames between fades. <br /> <br /> Best seen with friends and in a stupid mood.
