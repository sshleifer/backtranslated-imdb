I was very dissatisfied with this step. Everything was terrible from the start. The comedy was immoral, the action exaggerated, the songs omelodic. Even the story was weightless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked too hard and didn't help the movie at all. Of course, the Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should investigate how action movies are made. They tend to overdo it too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because it is their signature. But the Hindi cinema's signature is the songs. A good action movie should not last more than two hours and may not look unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these action movies will be much sharper. Also to note: comedy and action movies do not mix unless done correctly. Good luck next time.
