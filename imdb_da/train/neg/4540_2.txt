Initially three words: READ THE BOOK! Real Guys - This shows the difficulties with real release of esoteric conditions. I loved the book and was totally disappointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, with half a heart, and the story was wrongly explained. The novel - in the first place! - was not meant to focus on an adventure! It's just the surroundings. In the movie, the focus just turns on it and the message has taken the back seat! In addition, the visual effects that showed the energy of all living things and the clarification of the events at the end were parsimonious! They screwed it up! ... I will never see it again!
