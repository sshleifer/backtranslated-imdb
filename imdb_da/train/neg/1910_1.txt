I have tried to see this so-called comedy, but it is very difficult to carry. This is a bad, narrow-minded, clich√©-ridden movie. Finally not fun but very boring and annoying. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste of time - and there's no more to say I'm scared. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
