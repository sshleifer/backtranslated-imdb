This series just gets worse and worse. Badly written and simply not fun! The premise is excellent, but the author's inexperience shines through. By trying so hard to offend nobody, they end up insulting everyone. Now in the second season, the desperate cast stopped stopping their arms, and brought it patronizing, alley, "Oh, stupid you" style plays that come with a no laugh script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads against each other as if to say we are not zany? Is it not funny? Well, no, it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, except for corner gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come on CBC, you suppose to be our leading station showing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateurish mess.
