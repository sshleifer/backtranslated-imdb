I will admit that I did not give this movie a great chance. I decided quite early on that this was just not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Mostly, it has an excellent look with regard to its film. The scenes in the 70s in Manhattan look very good, as is the leading actress. It is a very sharp black and white, which can almost make the film feel odd and fresh. But some of the other techniques used by the filmmakers shoot it out to hell. The inconsistent editing is very late in the 60s, a place between surrealism and new wave. History also feels as if it originates from a very specific time, a place between free love idealism and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a young girl around town as she is looking for a man with whom she had an anonymous phone sex. As she meets other odd signs, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs. The movie appears to be a monstrous, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel. I would expect if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover the phone book. <br /> <br /> Some issues I had: At the end of the movie, a character tells a wandering anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes ?? - brutally sitting through. There is also a very explicit animation sequence that I found gross and juvenile to serve as the movie's climax. I laughed loudly four or five times, and I liked the end (minus the flattened vile animation). And when the movie changed to color for the final phone-booth-at-night sequence, I actually liked the way it looked even better. It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt I could really have liked it if it was a little different. But that's what the filmmakers gave us. It is unclear, artificial and far back on the dial, but none of them are reasons to recommend it on their own. I didn't find it unique or creative as much as forced and pretentious.
