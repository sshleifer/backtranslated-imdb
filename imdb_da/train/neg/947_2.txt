As a person who lived through and still remembers the decade alive, if the actual 70s had been half this fun and (semi) normal, they would have been so much more fun. The old children in that era did not work or behave anything close to as bright and normal as these children did. The country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and drug culture all the 60's uprisings that it created, especially in the behavioral department, petulance, suicide, self justice, childhood, their unfairness - none of the figures show any of it. <br /> <br /> Someone compared to "Happy Days" and I can see why: They were both sitcoms that took place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast, and they both offer only surface, clipped images of The actual eras, not even close to the full extent of it, just show the obvious things - fashion, toys, music, contraptions etc. and that's it. For those too young to remember, or were not born, trust I, the 70s were not like that, more than "Happy Days" was like the actual 50s, when "M * A * S * H * "did not accurately depict the life of an American Army medical base during Korean War, etc."
