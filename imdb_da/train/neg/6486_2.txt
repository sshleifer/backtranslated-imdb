If there is one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their eerie ability to take a story and tell it over and over and over. Even seeing commercial for Lady and Tramp II was an awful experience. Disney will destroy one of their most amazing classics ever. It even had the spaghetti meatball scene. It has been done before! And that's what I say to this excuse directly for video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even more of Bluth's really bad movie. Penguins and walrus duo (I have even forgotten their names) are just a really bad carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats almost all of her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really unpleasant. I have never heard songs so badly from them until now. And the dialogue is terrible. It is pathetic and simplified. On the plus side, at least they took time to make the animation somewhat decent. All the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be (or maybe it's minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just as boring that you can just throw up. I almost did. Make yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor. Don't waste your money on this. True, it is not as horrific as the Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but it is a little comforting.
