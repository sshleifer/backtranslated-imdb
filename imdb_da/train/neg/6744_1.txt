As you all know, JIGSAW did not make its way to Blackbuster because of a member of the Full Moon's own staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells to all video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take any JIGSAW and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The big problem with that is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is good, gold. I urge you all to move on to the BLEED page on the internet and vote for the movie that rejected JIGSAW and all your talents. Also, go to the JIGSAW page and equip high voices for it (if you don't already have it). We have to get JIGSAW up to at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED down to about 2 (then put it on the internet's 100 worst movie list). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. Hope everyone is fine - Matt
