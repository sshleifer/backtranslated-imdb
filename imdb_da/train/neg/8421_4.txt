It's funny that I find myself forced to go through this movie, but here I am. I go through it, because recently I had the chance to witness the revival of R.C. Sheriff's play "Journey's End" on stage in New York, at Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as masterful director of David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the theater shattered I am not exaggerating, I was flabbergastet. After nearly two and a half hours of a restored and very claustrophobic depiction of the soldier's life in the Somme forests (I wonder), during World War I, was alive by all involved, I came out of the theater with shakes. <br /> <br /> I'm not easily shocked and I'm not too sensitive either. I am an actor and a director myself, so I know the buttons are pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. But what I just saw came so much to life that I had chills in my spine when I left. None of these emotions came alive while watching "Aces High", the movie based on this game and even adapted the screen in collaboration with the RC Sheriff himself, shortly before he died. <br /> <br /> The screen customization takes place in skies over France. So away is the claustrophobic mood to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only plus in the movie is air combat scenes that look dated in their special effects over today's standards but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on the screen. A few screen adaptations were given of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in ditches and not in the sky, but it was the "German" vision of things if you would like to be fussy about such things . The "end of the journey" is just the other side of the medal, and would have made it a great movie if they had left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer on DVD is poor, although in Widescreen and adapted to 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the movie itself is the cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. It sports various defects, such as minor scratches and dots, even if the copy to the rest is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy watching old-timed air struggles, then this is a picture for you. But I would rather suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although it is also a movie filled with inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who love good acting and drama, I would leave this one out. Buy the game. Go look at the doctor if you have the chance to get a decent revival near you, but stay away from this would be adaptation. <br /> <br /> It is an anti-war film that is provided, but the weakest I have ever seen in my life ever. The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just a scam as they are only seen in very weak and very McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, delivering very weak performances not because of their lack of skills, but rather because of lack of truth. and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and as I said before, it draws itself to the dubious end. Dubious because in the original game, none of the men we get to know and sympathize with stay alive. They are all killed in a deadly and futile mission. In the film they all die, except Malcolm McDowell, who somehow is able to stay alive another day, as the unfortunate wing commander just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause . <br /> <br /> The end of the play leaves a mere stage in total darkness. You can only hear the guns roar, the machine guns rage and grenade through the theater. So suddenly, total peace and quiet. The curtain comes up. Lights. And here they are all. Lined up, standing straight and stiff. Obedient league ... <br /> <br /> Far more interesting and far more shocking than "Ace High" final, which is also drawn by the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do it, I would take the game and develop it as intended. Adding here and there an action scene in the field, just to visualize the "outer" fear and slaughter that takes place in the "great areas of France", around the men involved, but then just concentrated on what's happening in the little one " shack "at the edge of sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Ask for it. <br /> <br /> That's not it.
