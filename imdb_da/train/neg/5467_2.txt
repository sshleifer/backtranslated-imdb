What to say about this movie. Now it's about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and become criminal students who sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of these people have negative effects as one becomes a toxic avenger type, and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school's basement. It's all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. Although it is not fair, some people may like the movie of the Thomas and they can see it if they want to. Troma movies for myself are the worst movies out there. I just watched this out of morbid curiosity.
