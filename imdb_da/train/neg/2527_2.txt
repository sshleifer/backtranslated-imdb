This movie was packed with endless surprises! Just as you thought it couldn't get worse, they added more joints and more pink fuzzy-lined vans with raunchy sex scenes. As you can guess, I was the victim of the original version. We were fooled into seeing it, and thought it was the Supervan, the host, who promised lasers, prison breaks, and more. Who would have thought a Christmas gift in the Dollar Store could have been so much fun!
