After the successful successful MASTI, who was better off, Inder Kumar again came with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie. DO NOT SEE GOOD, HAVE NO EVIL <br /> <br /> The movie reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play the blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring exercise < br /> <br /> The film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't want to laugh as Snehal Dabi's head gets stuck in the back of the horse and all the kind of comedies we don't laugh at now, but mocke. The movie starts in a clich√©d way, and some scenes are fun, unfortunately such moments do not last too long since the story never moves in this half, even though the comedy becomes boring. The turn is handled well and the other half becomes an action movie where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroes, and we have all the OTT hunting scenes and battle scenes <br /> <br /> Direction from Inder Kumar's Bad Music is OK , a song stands out I love you, my soul <br /> <br /> Vivek is horrible in the comic scenes, his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes. For some reason, he continues to make comedy and ruined his career. Fardeen Khan is better, but also wood. Among the others are Esha and Amrita heroines Boman Irani irritates here Snehal Dabbi is okay
