You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. It would be a mistake. This is one of the most meaningless movies ever made. I was waiting for something fun to do, but there is nothing fun in this movie. Even the film industry recognized that this was a very weak movie and did not even attempt to promote it. It is a wonder that it was ever put on video. I wonder what kind of contract was caused by Sellers to be in this movie. I also wonder why the people responsible for this movie had to continue making other bad movies. Surely, this movie is a waste of money used to create it and waste some time to see it. Surely there are high school students who could write / produce a movie as a plot.
