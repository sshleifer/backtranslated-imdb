Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fierce downfall in 1957. Well, the film is mostly in 1986. The film falls into the trap of the 80s of strange / stupid special effects, including something weirdly denied look rocking horse. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things for humans and tries to take over a person's body. Whether she succeeds, you have to look to find out. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is pretty boring and based on a bunch of worthless characters. This is also not a successor, the only thing that is common to the first is the name of the high school. It has dropped. horror flick falls back, make, meaningless nudity, knocks against the Catholic Church. Basic stuff, boring movie. The play is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
