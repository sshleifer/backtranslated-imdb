We all know that countless duds have presented the 80s slaughter the genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a little hastey but terrible if "Slaughter High" wasn't terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher flick. Precisely, the plot involves a child who experienced a Carrie-like shower degradation in high school and returns to the forged building to seek revenge over a group of former bullies, all of whom prove to be reminisce. As you would expect, they are killed by a masked madman on April 1 by electrocution, burning, hanging and chemically modified beer. I have a number of issues with the details and settings of this movie, but given the end, I feel the need to reject my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any thought to see this movie ...
