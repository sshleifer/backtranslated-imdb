This movie is undoubtedly the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that says a lot, considering that I've seen such stinkers as Demon of Paradise, Lovers Lane and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there is nothing more entertaining than a badly made slasher flick. With regard to this film, it appears that the opening scene, where a woman is fried in a tanning, has no influence on the film, especially since the film does not tell that the event happened 2 years before the rest of the film. The play is non-existent, and most of the camera's shots are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most rocky, monotonous actor I've ever seen. However, the best / worst part of this movie should be the murder weapon. A huge safety pin?! What did they think? Who's the killer? An unhappy "Huggies" employee? I would have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if I didn't have a blast to watch it
