An expedition led by hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Kingdom of Cairo to find out what happened to a previous expedition. They meet beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They are soon faced with a blood-drinking mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> A real snoozer. I caught this on sennat tv when I was about 10. It put me in bed! To see it again all these years later I can see why. It goes slow, the mummy doesn't even show up before 40 minutes in (and it's only 66 minutes long!), The action ranges from bad (Dana) to REAL bath (George N. Neise), and there is no violence or blood to do exist This film concentrates more on second rate drama (involving a silly love triangle) than horror. This bets three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it right, there are some good actors from Diane Brewster, it's short, and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) are not bad. They are not scary just mildly scary. Still, this movie is pretty bad. A safe fire cure for insomnia.
