Sheesh! What a horrible movie. Dodgy camera work, a script with more corn than Kellogg's, and act so hammy you could open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> In order to do it all, it does not know which target group to target - we have Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - get on his soap box about the dangers of smoking when someone lights a cigarette, dear oh, and in another awkward scene we have the bad, Lobo, forcing his ahem if you want to 'male friend' striptease dressed in a bikini. Try to explain that one for the kids ... Throw in an overly confidential Treasure Island-cum-Jaw type story, and the result is a movie that is inadvertently fun, it's fun - I shouldn't expect a special edition DVD any time soon.
