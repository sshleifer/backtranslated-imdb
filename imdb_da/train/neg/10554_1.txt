An Avent-garde nightmare, extremely low budget "movie" that has delusions. Hard to sit through. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow great revelation. I had no idea that it was wrong before you showed this. Yes it is sarcasm. DO NOT see this "movie" if you are offended by the nudity of either the male or female sex. Don't look at it if at least you are squeamish. Don't look at it if you worry about acting. On second thoughts you just don't see that period. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Make the movie, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movie stills, director's commentary, 2 versions of teaser trailer, music video by The Azoic, and a classroom video experiment
