I didn't enjoy this movie. I thought the play wasn't very good and the story was boring. A 20 year old computer saves the day? I thought this was just a bit far taken, even for a movie. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off why not take a sledge hammer for it. It's a shame, but after the original 80's movie, you expected so much more than what was actually delivered. This movie could have been a 21st century version of the old movie, it wasn't. If that's what you want to see, don't watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Although the old computer had not come up to save the day, I would still consider it a very very cheesy flick.
