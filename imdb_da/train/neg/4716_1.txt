This show is boring, hampered and dives because of all sorts of things to make it "original". First time: The animation is so ugly ... Johnny is horrible ... and everyone's annoying. The twins look like teenage figures from "Dexter's Lab," and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee (also from "Dexter's Lab.") Second, they plots ... are painfully paralyzed and make them difficult to follow. Gags are corny, and nothing really makes me laugh a bit ... especially when trying to be fun. I only saw two episodes, but they only knocked me off. <br /> <br /> Third time: The entire theme song begins by tearing off the tune of the Green Days "American Idiot". And although I'm not a big fan of that band, I find it really stupid that they would take the same opening song and then subtly change it to make it their own. <br /> <br /> Case in point ... it's a big fat ugly bore. 1.10
