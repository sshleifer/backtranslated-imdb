The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that just by searching this movie and investing time to see it, you put more emphasis on the experience than many of its instructors did, especially director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> The already fleeting Peckinpah was heading for harsh weather with this movie. According to at least one movie theater, this was where he became acquainted with cocaine. In addition, he is binge drinking, and it is no wonder that things fell apart. It's a shame because the concept behind the movie is good, and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private entrepreneurs who do very dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, live well and work like the best friends - then something happens to crush their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene shows that they are jumping into a building - why exactly we're not told couples for the course about the movie's obscure motivation. But the implication is that these guys hurt people and don't really care - antiheroes much like Wild Peanut Peckinpahs not so long ago. An opening title tells us that they are working for ComTeg and then adding obvious tongue to the cheek. "The idea that the CIA can hire such an organization for any purpose is, of course, confusing." It's a pretty smart way to let the audience know that all bets are off. Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup, including Burt Young, Gig Young and Peckinpah Regular Bo Hopkins in the role of the plum as a madman who cannot pass a chance to get shot at $ 500 a day and you only want The scriptwriters, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, tried to do more with the story than making it a platform for lazy-liners and bad chop-socky knockoffs. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social commentary is scary in. "You're so busy doing their dirty work, you can't tell who the evil ones are," someone Locken says as if he or we need it pointed out. <br /> <br /> Even worse is Peckinpa's clumsy direction and sluggish pacing. We are 40 minutes into the movie before we get our first battle scene, a totally chaotic collection of random shots, where a bunch of people we haven't even met are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport, their battle narrowing with a conversation in a office suite. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie there is a battle within a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships, the ninjas running into it open to being shot down while Caan throws off a liners that suppress a hint of real excitement. "Put me seven to five, I'll take that little guy," he whispered just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is Ninjas land. (The fight takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties will break up.) <br /> <br /> Caan is much better in smaller scenes, which when Locken recovers from some unpleasant injuries, is told by one of his executives played by a smooth Arthur Hill that he has become "Humpty-dumped" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, though momentum killer for the film, have a fine role from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supportive nurse. Caan was one of the best actors in the 1970s, and his laconic play with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and both Youngs gives "Killer Elite" real surveillance. <br /> <br /> But you're not looking at "Killer Elite" thinking about it. You see it thinking about the movie that came away.
