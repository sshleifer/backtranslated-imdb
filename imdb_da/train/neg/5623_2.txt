Hollywood's attempt to make Jack London's life a "Jack London" adventure movie is not a bad idea; Certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. However, this film becomes flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some Londonesque speeches; and it's great to see his bearded Jack receive "The Call of the Wild" after spending some quality time alone in the snow-covered mountains with his dog, "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film draws unfortunate "Yellow Peril" parallels between London's life and World War II, which is both strained and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
