This is what you would get if you allowed a 10-year-old (manic-American) to write a story about a moon trip. Absolute garbage without redeeming qualities Perhaps it was a lot of fascination in 3D dept. But as a narrative and entertaining animation, it didn't matter to make waste worth an hour and a half. Save your time and money and see BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Damn. Not enough lines, but I feel what sums it up ... yes, I agree with a review above - it's like a cold war propaganda story. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies that uncover the hoax of the moon landing or if the flies were dead in the first moment. BTW - why were all the protagonist's flies deformed? - Not one had the full compliment of limbs!
