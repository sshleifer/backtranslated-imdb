Greenaway seems to have a habit of deliberately awakening his viewers. This film opens with incest - and pointless, meaningless, informal incest thereon. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers the parlor tricks to be shocked to actually do something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. He's just a little perverted for the sake of perversion.
