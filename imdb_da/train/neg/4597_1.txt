Having shown this inaccurate movie, I admit it is a more modern story about history than previous versions. Yet it is so inaccurate, and it has been made so politically correct that it made me sad after seeing it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have been better cast as Sam Houston gave both men's love of oratory. I think that self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett, and it would certainly have fed into his hungry sense of self-confidence. As a Texan and a true believer in Texas thought, I feel that Davy Crockett was the hallmark of Texan, although he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is "It's not Braggin 'if it's a fact" was made for Crockett. And the last scene on the Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, must be the greatest insult to Davy Crockett ever made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and spicy giant would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different eyewitness statements put him dead in the midst of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand-to-hand combat. Finally, the lame ending in the movie, which allegedly shows San Jacinto's fight as a joint fight with 600 Texasans against 700 Mexican soldiers, is actually closing as there were actually closer to 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. Any Texas schoolchildren who notice attention in their first Texas history class know the battle surprised the Mexican army at siesta time, and the Mexican army was so confused that they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight borderline hand to hand.
