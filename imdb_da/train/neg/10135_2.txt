I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things I thought could have been improved; plays, writing, instruction, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed as if the authors had no idea of ​​anything to do with the movie. Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super-advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $ 75 million. Nowadays, these things cost about $ 3 billion, and they can't go invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the Middle East in an hour. There was a totally random lesbian scene I didn't mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera will randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes. Oh yes, as it's a Steven Segal movie, it's predictable as hell. All in all, I rank it right up there with snakes on a plane.
