From the critical recognition, I expected more from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just collapsed and did not seem to have a point or plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so angry to get the loss of her virginity "over". Maybe I'm too young to relate (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no trouble connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love, or life is beautiful, and I wasn't alive for any of these settings. The cast is very good, but unfortunately for them the script has not allowed them to engage the audience. Overall, slums had their moments, but unless you yearn to recall lame peaks and tube socks, I'd say skip this one.
