I really love the sexy action and sci-fi movies in the sixties, and that's because of the actor who appeared in them. They found the sexy women to be in these movies, and it didn't matter if they could act (remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed with this movie was that it wasn't nostalgic enough. The story here has a European sci-fi movie called "Dragonfly" being made and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) complete the picture. They are a really beautiful woman in the movie playing Dragonfly, but she's right in it. Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his father's exploits from his early days and inserts it into the manuscript. I wish the movie could have been a tribute to the early films. They could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. There is an actor in this movie that was popular from the sixties and its John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I will have to continue waiting for a director to make a good tribute to the films from the sixties. If anyone reads this, "Make it as Sexual as Possible"! I will wait!
