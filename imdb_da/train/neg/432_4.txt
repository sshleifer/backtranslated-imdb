This movie had the potential to be far more than it was. But it does not only fail to deliver, it brings unpleasant even fair preaching at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than he was in the Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he must have a southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino makes his shot but seems to be going through this movie and collecting a paycheck. He is good as usual, but hardly stands out. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast - throws in female romantic interest, which added a bit about something to the story. Talking about the story, a marvelous "who really cares" tale where Cusack is the self-righteous mayor's boy who just has to search for "the right thing" to do. People are not acting this way. Cusack's character loses all credibility at the end, which without revealing it is preaching and nausea. The final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem deep. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not come into law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad one, by the number film. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes, and then it really is a preaching, proselytizing, self-righteous movie for the last hour. Better with mindless crap than this pile of junk.
