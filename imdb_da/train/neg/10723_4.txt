The soul of an old mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he can punish all those involved in the destruction of his grave. The soul transfer makes the youth age at a tremendous pace until he resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the grave. To be as short as possible, Pharaoh's curse is rightly the insidious affair. While the film presents some good, original ideas (blood sucking mummies, soul transfer, interesting make-up effects, arm rhythm scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make the case even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime does not consist more than padding. I usually go for these slow-flowing mummy films, but Pharaoh's curse even tests my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot, if the film could have focused more on her mysterious character), it has been thrown as boring as the manuscript. Finally, I do not know whether it was putting that mummy appearance in what seems to be pajamas, but it is a ridiculous and ridiculous look for a creature to instill fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments about Pharaoh's curse, I have to judge it a 4/10. Not a good rating to be safe but generous given all the problems I have with the movie.
