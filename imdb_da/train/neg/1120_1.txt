I watched this movie in my international cinema class and got exhausted to get started. This movie is nothing but a scene of blatant shock value after the next. The fourth man is about an alcoholic writer called Reve, who has visions of his invincible danger. He meets with a woman named Christine when giving lectures at a local book club, and decides to stay with her only when he discovers how attractive his girlfriend is. To put it better, Reve may like the Dutch sausage. So Reve tells a plan to seduce Christian's girlfriend so he can eventually get sex with him. But it was later discovered that Christine had three former husbands, whom she all murdered. Now Reve and Christine's girlfriend can be "THE 4TH MAN." The story makes sense without plot holes. The editing and everything else technical about this movie is just fine. The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically it's not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Reve out of bed in just a t-shirt. So in the beginning you will see Reve's lovely pecker, who flakes around as he walks around in his narrow apartment in a hangover state. Later, he has a dream in which his pecker is cut by a pair of scissors, and they show it along with the blood source that comes with it. Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has gay sex in a mausoleum. Plus there is a lot of blood. More blood than all Freddy Krueger films combined. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is just as obvious when it comes to shocking. The entire film is rotated around the shock value. <br /> <br /> So if any of this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise far far far far away from this one remains. My mind is still the year.
