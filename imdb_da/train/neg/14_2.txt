There are times when you end a movie you want to get reimbursed for the time spent. This was one of those times. I almost left with only 15 minutes left to endure ... and I wish I had ... The pace that a man goes from a straight twisted, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility can never be so quick. From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), the privilege and culture of being made to be seduced by a woman, by violence and by changing substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when you observe the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But in favor of a penny in for a pound aspect of drugs, violence and commitment to someone he has just met is impossible to understand. Frankly, in addition to staring at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do something else ...
