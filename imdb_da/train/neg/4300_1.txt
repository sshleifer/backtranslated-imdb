Buford's Beach Bunnies gives B-class T&A a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was shocked to find some attempts to exploit the young actress talents. I specifically refer to the apparent lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What is the next generation of sad teenage boys who see this on sennat tv to think about?
