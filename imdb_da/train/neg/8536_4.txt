This is a typical Steele novel production by two people who have undergone some kind of tragedy being able to come together despite the odds. I would not call this a spoiler because everyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they all end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't continue reading. Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a French French woman who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making movies where she needs an accent because otherwise a good actress cannot realistically draw any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an outstanding actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather creepy divorce. He is gentle, convincing and convincing in this role. The two meet at the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he was talking to the child. Everyone becomes friends after this episode, and then the couple falls in love. The chemistry between the two leads is not amazing, although the talent for these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, major tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they come together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> I wanted thoughtless entertainment and I got it with this. With regard to the genre of romantic films, this fails to memorize. "A secret affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), just as some of Steeles previous books became movies.
