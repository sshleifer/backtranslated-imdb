I had such great hopes for this movie because I loved the original so much. It looks like Disney is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-DVD sequels. They deserve a raid. More, actually. I thought the idea was profitable, but the music was horrible, and the story wasn't much better. What happened to the great music Disney had in their movie. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King ... even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. They have made so many good films over the years that it is really sad that they have sunk to point to making followers who are not even good enough to put in the theaters. I hope this movie is not an indication of things to come to Walt Disney Corporation.
