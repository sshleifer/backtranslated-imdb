This was a pretty scary movie; I found the music to be effective for this. The photographs Mario took from the village were also unpleasant. However, I had three problems with this movie. One is that the lighting was very dark, so it might be hard to tell what was going on, but it might just have been my copy. The second is that the beginning is not explained very well, and I am still not sure what was going on there. The third problem is that I didn't understand the end, but apparently some people do. Of course, there are also the common problems that people do stupid things, and the male lead is very 70s. All in all noticeable but not even close to being a favorite.
