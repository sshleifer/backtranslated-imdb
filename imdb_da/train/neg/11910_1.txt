What is interesting is that the actor; was not bad, just not enough. It was pretty lame. Special effects or lines were the only culprit for this mistake. Standing alone, they were not terribly bad, but put together was a tragic move. The view seemed slow and slow, with special effects apparently designed to speed up the movie, but it failed completely. Many of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects. Don't believe it, they were pretty cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this experiment. Although she might have been all they had to choose from with a little fan recogniton. An experienced actress would have brought something to the part that Appleby never did. Scfi broadcasts some really good original movies, it is just too bad that this did not succeed so drastically.
