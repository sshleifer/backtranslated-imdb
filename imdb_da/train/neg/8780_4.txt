Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Shortly after, he is contacted by a Dr. Price, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), claims he has received messages from Jonathan's late wife Anna through various electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is this just a hint of something on a larger cosmic or other world scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he's stuck with is obsolete and absurd on points; It is as if the film does not know how to answer some of the issues it raises so it distracts the viewer only with new unrelated issues. Keaton herself is pretty good, convincingly cast as a vanishing widower trying desperately to communicate with her late wife. He matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the frat-friendly waacky-hanink's roles he played 15 or so years earlier. He looks a little sharp, perhaps with a few wrinkles than one might expect, but he hasn't lost any of the nonsense and panache he has shown in his quarter-century in Hollywood. So it's not that Keaton turns into a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it progresses, every difficult road ending in another difficult road. It's all good and good if the path leads to some kind of acceptable degradation, something that binds more or less all and explains ... something. But not White noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I first saw him. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to see this junk even though he gets good support from Ian McNeice (as Dr. Pris) and Deborah Kara Unger as the required love interest.
