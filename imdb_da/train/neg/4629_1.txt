Of course, made to show the famous 1950s stripping Misty Ayer's "acting" talents. Too bad can she not act. <br /> <br /> Drilling a little tale of sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) is killed and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets the cozy Tommy Cole, who immediately falls in love with her. He will help her escape, but can he? You really don't care. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayer's stripes just FAR to her underwear (twice). The rest is just a tedious little tale chockful of bad acting, horrible "comedy" (never thought prostitution was fun, but what do I know?) And awful post-dubbed dialogue. I admit that there was a twist on the end I could not see, but it is not enough to sit through this. Also Ayer's attempt to act is hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
