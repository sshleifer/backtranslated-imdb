Yes, I judged this movie as a star horrible. Nevertheless, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies going forward. This is really so bad, it's good. This is another K.Gordon Murray production (read: Buying a really cheap / poor Mexican movie, spending zero money to make it double in English and releasing it on kiddie matin√©es in the mid-1960s.) It's a shame I stumbled upon this so late in life as I'm sure some "mood enhancers" would make this an even better experience. I will not rehash what many of the other reviewers have already said, a Christmas movie featuring Merlin, the Devil, mechanical drain cleaner and some of the most pathetic children's actors I have ever seen bar none. I plan to run this during the holiday back to back with Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". Really a holiday experience made in hell. Now, if I can only find "For All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I have a triple feature that can't be beat. You have to watch this movie. It moves so slowly that I don't hesitate to touch the fast forward button - especially on the two dance routines! This thing series like an expensive bleu cheese guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
