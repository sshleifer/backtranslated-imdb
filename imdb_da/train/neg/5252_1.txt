I read some comments on the internet about this movie as "... harder than Hostel ...", "the camera never shuts off when it gets really brutal ...". But none of them are true. The camera never shuts off because there is nothing to screen. The same scene is repeated a hundred hundred times again. Women lie on a table, killer rape women sometimes, killer cuts women to pieces (you never see this during the whole movie!). The police come and arrest him. Killer fools the jury. Movie about. In Germany we would say, "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring movies I ever see. Absolutely not advisable.
