I had some time to kill before I watch football, so I watched this movie being offered on the scifi channel, and literally after seeing it, I thought I had come across my version of mentally walking in the Bataan death throat when my consciousness was turned into submission to the horrible film that ripped out of the mummy series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie, and so it went into such an immense descent that it made the latest stock market decline like a hiccup. The action was so bad that I hoped that one and all would be buried in the end. The management of Casper Van Dien made me look for Steven Seagal's high caliber in "On Deadly Ground" when his line reading was so wood that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional reach is so limited that I was under the impression that my kitten was more expressive when asked for popcorn to eat. The direction was so abysmal, I looked back yearning for my nephew's grade 3 play recital, which had more pace and better vision, and the fact that this movie seems to have been splintered from the thought of the aforementioned film franchise it can't even imagine as a tribute. The FX in the movie was so bad I thought the director and the producers were amazingly friendly by reusing cheap special effects from last year's class Z horror flicks. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis did in these films is beyond me, and they should look at lawsuits against their mistaken agents to get them involved in such a boy about a movie. My warning to one and all is to watch this movie at your peril, as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with longer viewing. On a page note, I noticed at IMDb that sometimes movie wages were published. I wondered if their is a way actors who should return the wages to their bad ideas in such films. Beware and be sure to avoid at all costs.
