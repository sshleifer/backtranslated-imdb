A friend of mine borrowed this video for me and I was pretty excited to see it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfield's slow song and Lars banged on his drum in what seemed to be slow motion, I began to think : "Why am I watching this? The question will coursing through your mind for 5 10 minutes after you play Play. I gave the tape back the same day you would suspect, not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
