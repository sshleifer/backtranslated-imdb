This had to be one of the most god horrible wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by 2 games. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete washout and to be honest I almost fell asleep. It was so actionless that the captain's fight was not worth having the subtitles in, and the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you really are a big fan of WWE and have missed the early days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you will surely love this. But I found out that this Wrestlemania left much to be desired.
