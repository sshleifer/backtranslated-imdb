Two houses, one street, one phone box, one car, one girl next door, one boy next door and one zombie. This list of ingredients should be sufficient for a large horror movie. All you need is some blue light, surrounding music and ... done. Not in the hands of the Dutch director van Rouveroy himself! <br /> <br /> I would like to arrange "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get some spirits, get some movie-cutting friends, and immerse yourself in the worst cinema offer. For such an evening, this peace in rubbish is one of the best. Laughs guaranteed! The bizarre thing is, van Rouveroy still defends his film as if it was a great achievement. To be a witness to this, listen to the DVD's comment track. Again: disbelieve and laughing guaranteed!
