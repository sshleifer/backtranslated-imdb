"Masters of Horror" has proven to be a bad arena for message episodes, and although Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes in the series, period) can be done, it is most appropriate to do so has come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing loses horror more than a soapbox). And 'Pro-Life' simply melts reactionary views with ultra-violence; Young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), who is seen continuously through the forest, is almost hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who are just entering work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelica's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a hard coal, far right holy roll that will do everything to prevent his daughter from abortion. If nothing else, Pro-Life accumulated something for its controversial problem, but John Carpenter treats this whole venture with sensational indifference - he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is indeed poor); The slow pacing builds no tension and brings the already ambling plot to a creep. Even when Dwayne and his sons are storming at the clinic, you can shoot guns, it's a great non-event; Later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion', the scene comes out as free and unnecessary - an attempt to brush out the signed film. The bad performances (Perlman is unfortunately wasted here) become an unfolding of the manuscript, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted as if 'Pro-Life' is the source of his next hot meal. When a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster-suit prowler the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess thought ...
