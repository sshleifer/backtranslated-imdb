I must admit I have been a sucker for samurai flicks since I remember. I used to look rather rude, whether it was "elitist", like The Seven Samurai or the bloody cartoon variation like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked US / Japanese "Crossovers" like The Bushido Blade. And of course everything contains Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've almost seen every samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. In 1993, I first saw Kabuto on video that even Samurai movies can be boring. In the beginning I was looking forward to Mayeda reaching Europe and the confrontations that would come from it, but when he actually came to Spain, I really didn't care about the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't make the movie's justice to call it "bad". Technically, it is a pure entry into the genre. But there is simply never enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a fraction of the above-mentioned Japanese actors charisma. And talking about Sho Kosugi's son Kane, which appears from almost all Sho Kosugi films as Sho's son: he has inherited little to any of his fathers' limited action skills. Adding to minus points is the absence of blood and gore, which until then was a trademark of all samurai films. This was of course intended for a younger American / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it's such a movie for the average historical action-adventure fan, but a bar for hardened fans of the Samurai cinema. Fans who are in "Samurai meetings ??" The genre should rather go see Red Sun (1971), with Charles Bronson as a cowboy who has to quit Samurai Toshiro Mifume to pick up a samurai sword from the bad guy Alan Delon. It's pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> So even though the movie is only 100 minutes, it looks like a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I gave this an honorable 4/10 point instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I have to admit that his 'Engrish' is sometimes fun but gets tedious after approx. 30 minutes.
