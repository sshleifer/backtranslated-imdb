Letting the class see this in English was a bad idea. Movies that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it seems that this has no effect on the class - when the teacher left, conversations began quickly - and I couldn't hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" used at all. And when you look at this, it's easy to see why. The play is nothing special - everyone seems to be bored, just reading from the side without care in the world. Shakespeare always preferred prominent dialogue to action and death, but I just couldn't understand a word that someone said. The costumes are not so bad, nor the special effects - the class may not have loved the movie, but they did not even take p-ss. But it's hard to joke about a movie that lacks any kind of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the start of the film were not so badly done - although the rain looked a little unrealistic, everything else was good and good. But where were the cut heads and exploding masters? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have been taken much more seriously if he were wearing clothes - but as everything was on show, he was just another excuse for a joke. This movie is in no way appealing to both sexes. Women and girls will not have any romance or comedy to enjoy and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys away. Tempest was not badly done, but it felt like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And the general boredom and lack of inspiration shows. 3.10
