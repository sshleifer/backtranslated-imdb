The script for this television soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play as an undergraduate drama student to bring some life to his scripture-dead character. I don't know if this was the purpose of the director, but Hopkins' Ciano only reeked of vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano might be everything, but then why make a movie about him? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long way down was as if closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was generally ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent script), while she should be the key feature of this alleged family drama. See it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap opera.
