The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Fortunately, highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie all the time (rated lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). Don't let the cover of this movie decide. Kill Shot stars up and forthcoming star Koji as a modern Sherlock Holmes. Using such high tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji can help FBI agents in tracking a man who has not committed any overt crime. While there are other actors in the film, including short comedies by Denise Richards, a gay negro, and an eerie nasty and annoying girl, Koji wears this movie alone. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will surely love Kill Shot.
