What happens to RGV? He seems to repeat in every movie. Has he run out of creative ideas? If he has time to take a back seat. Went to watch the movie with great expectation - of course I didn't even think it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promoter said it all. But even then, I thought it would be a good RGV treatment, after all, isn't he the same guy who led Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have no doubt having seen Aag. I will not talk about the plot or story as most of it is taken from the original, if you really are dying to see this, you can play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give characters of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), Guess Hereru doesn't sound great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that was really effective in the company sounds false. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more charming Nisha is trying to be the more annoying she gets. This reaches a tip at the end. Raj is actually not bad compared to the others, he is a guy to see in the future. I was really disappointed by Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl, all covered with a shawl, instead of inspiring fear, he resembles a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I don't have the patience to write any more.
