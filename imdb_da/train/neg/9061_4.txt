What can you say about this movie? It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good! Two days earlier, I had seen Lillies, and it was one of the best Gay movies I've ever seen. So it wasn't the best time to see a mediocre Gay-flick. The story was stupid and the actor was ok. It wasn't bad enough to turn off, but it had some bad moments and some horrible stereotypes. Nor was it well thrown. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you want to waste your time and money. I don't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them. Use your time to see Noah's Arc on Logo instead. I think this is where this movie tried to go, but never came there.
