Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's rarity, but it's definitely not worth hunting. This Italian jaw rip-off gives little sense most of the time and no sense the rest. The "alligator" is not convincing at all, and many of the subplots do not go anywhere. If it's with the local video store, you might see it if you're a monster movie fan, but it's not worth chasing down.
