I checked this movie out as it still had 6 voices, and it said 7.2 or something, but it's seriously a horrible movie. Let's break it down. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a handheld digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college. The next thing you will notice is that the actors are all friends of the beginner (he has probably met them in the pub the night before. Third in the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible and they are trying to grab many songs in this movie at intervals of 30 seconds ... also all digital editing has been made on said freshman's home PC ... probably using Windows Movie Maker.This movie was horrible ... pretentious, had an unthinkable bad script and acted I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I put the author and director to see this movie in hell for an eternity.
