"Don't drink the water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on a 1966 Broadway game by Woody Allen. It stars Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind "The Honeymooners". Director Howard Morris has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Angst, Silent Movie) and has made a mark in animation (characters he has pronounced include Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What went that wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is being played out too seriously to work effectively. Everyone's original game was heavy-in-cheek, why it worked on Broadway and in the Allens 1994 remake. The play by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock put the premise on death and make too many changes from the original game. Making Gleasons wife a flight in this version as she was a main competitor woman in the original is just an example of why this doesn't work. The play is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can't save this. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a fine actor that he demonstrated in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abusive personality could have worked here, but the miserable script doesn't even give him a chance. Too bad. Estelle Parsons' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes. See how soon it will take you to stifle her. It is also a shame because she is also a fine actress who has beaten two extraordinary performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". Neither of the other actors does it well either. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this movie so much that he reminded the movie in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the leaders. They manage to hit all the right notes, and the movie itself is a cartoon masterpiece. It's finally on video after a long battle for rights. Go out and find the version. All 1969 originals are good at clearing out unwanted guests who exceed their welcome. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 stars
