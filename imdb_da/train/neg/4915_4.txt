One of the previous reviewers wrote that there was apparently no gap for Love Story statements; one loved it or hated it. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions across the scale from 1 to 10. For me, this movie has rated a 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland is in a fantastic job as Oliver's father. But the film did not do a particularly convincing job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique that at least it was not eligible for multiple views. I can be a little snob but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal. I still haven't seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all, are destroyed for me by his presence. The only exception is What's Up, Doc ?, where his equal performance is the perfect underline for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist - and by no means does he take a shot at Love Story for good! McGraw and O'Neal tend to curl their lines rather than act on them. <br /> <br /> This movie is remarkable at the start of a fine career: it was Tommy Lee Jones first film.
