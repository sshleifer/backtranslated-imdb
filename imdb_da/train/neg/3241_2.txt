This movie had potential, but it does really bad, is Lindsay Crouss's play. I have never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there who like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is poor. Her delivery is robot. When she delivered her lines it turned out that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and simply read the list in her head. So her voice has very little bending. I can't believe anyone who was bad at acting got a major role in a movie. She needs to know someone in biz. Now I hate being this means about her, but the comment must be "this" long, and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else. <br /> <br /> But I liked where the story went, so I continued to see it. The first part of the script has created a good movie. But the end was also disappointing. Maybe if her action had been better, I would have liked it.
