PLAN B looks like a quick, unprocessed, sloppy script for a movie attempting excursion for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. It's just another mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those who participate. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the Chief of Crime more concerned about clothing and appearance than about his business of control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is stupid than dirt and his ignorance must be fun. Maloni has whacked one of his debtors (who happens to be married to bookish Fran-Diane Keaton), and Maloni takes Fran as his assistant to work out of his dead husband's debt by being Maloni's "hit man". Fran is afraid of her own shadow and cannot perform Maloni's duties and instead chooses to transport her "whackees" to Florida to hide over her brother James's house until she can find out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A is killing them! The end is completely predictable, just as all lines are assigned in the script to the characters. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedienne, but here she screams and shakes and walks through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to see . Paul Sorvino is also the Paul Sorvino-type cast from other mobster movies. The support cast can also play on the balcony in the widest slapstick, chat mode imaginable. What should be a comedy ends up being just silly and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes has to go back to TV sitcoms: this slim story had been compressed for half an hour of concert, it could have had a chance. Grady Harp
