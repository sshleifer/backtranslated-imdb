This movie makes the Canadians and the British be asinine, moronic idiots. The men are stoned / full, and then they scream / beat each other in almost every scene. The women are redundant for the story ?? I do not understand what they are there for ?? They use every scene that causes a ruckus, or worse, milling as confused cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either scary vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chickens. It's the standard knocked-up girlfriend, her losing boyfriend and his evil mother ridicule, which we've seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Each character here is a carping, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all looked like they needed a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of scene involves sex with George Wendt? shudder ?? is enough to make someone gag! I saw the movie because Samuel West was in it ?? but I cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this. Maybe he needed the money. Ian Tracey is an amazing actor - the only one with a vague redemption moment, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot ?? the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back ?? gab - or Karl ?? who is dead, but who is actually a character who is very alive in the minds of those who are left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece? though I am ashamed to have thought of comparing these two films myself) why even bother? Karl is so wrong that you find the circumstances of his death satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At the end of this miserable movie, I thought they would all have been better off with him on that boat!
