This movie looked interesting; I wanted to read the book a number of years ago, and it informed me that the feature followed the plot view quite closely. <br /> <br /> Beginning to see it and almost from the start it was not possible to live up to expectations. In fact, I did not disturb everything ... badly - bad notions, bad actors and instantly scary characters - that was the meaning of the movie, I think. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this feature.
