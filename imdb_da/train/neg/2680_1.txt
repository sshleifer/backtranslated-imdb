Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I will ever see. I also didn't like the movie, as some Aussie men smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I wouldn't go to this country no matter what after I watched this movie. In fact, this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I'd rather stick to the US instead. After seeing some of the movie in the theater, including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and refunded my money because I cannot tolerate this movie. If you're going to Thailand to meet someone there who might be a drug smuggler, forget it!
