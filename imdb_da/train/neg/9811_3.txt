What can I say??? This movie was so stupid and stupid I thought it was a psychotic DRAG comedy - They should rename the "Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a silly waste of time if you want to see (DIE DIE !!!) Jennifer Tilly is her Freaky self, so just rent one of the "Chucky" movie, oh, "The Bride Of Chucky." more fun to watch the two Ugly Plastic dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly turned into the UGLY Female version of Chucky) to have Squeaky plastic rubber sex and then watch Daryl Hannah be pregnant, stupid and stupid; & Jennifer Tilly Grind Her Husbang in a Food Processor reminded me of my mother trying to do housework! OK, it's just BAD !!!
