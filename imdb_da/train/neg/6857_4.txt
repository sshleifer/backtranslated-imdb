This "screwed comedy" seems very forced. Actually, the actors are trying very hard to make a scary script. And as a result, it doesn't really go anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman finding out she was pregnant after having a quick divorce is just not that fun. And then, when Cooper sneaks off with the child because he doesn't want it set up for adoption, it just seems terribly unfunny, and it really pushes hard to make this a comedy. It's also a shame as the actors were better than the script and I found myself sorry for the whole mess. Considering that Cooper made so many good comedies, I recommend you see them instead.
