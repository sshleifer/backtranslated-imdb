An eerie "misfits-in-the-army" saga, half-heartedly trying to be both surreal (the foreign subtitles) and vulgar (flatulence), but just ending up being a mixture of many different kinds of humor, none of them followed much successfully. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl from "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
