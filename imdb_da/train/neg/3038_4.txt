"How she moves" is only alive when its high-energy, talented cast members kick their heels and stretch their stuff to the camera. Otherwise, this stupid striving-suffering-and-success story is low on energy, low originality and low on something that can make the movie stand out from dozens of other like-minded movies that have come before it. <br /> <br /> Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner city youth who finds out that the best way to raise her private school tuition is to enter rallies, but she and her contributors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and unintentional direction. As mentioned earlier, the movie achieves some sparkle when the artists are on stage dance, but such moments are far too few and unfortunately fleeting.
