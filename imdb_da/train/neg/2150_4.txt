You immediately recognize the plot. Daughters of a divorced couple are trying to get mother and father together again. Yes, it was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the scary thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills while playing the dating daughter roles, Durbin looks much older than in adults. And then all her so-called siblings do. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child goes all over the movie. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor suits, but look ridiculous in them, as the director seems to have pain pointing to their abundant peaks and tushies throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others begin to "turn on" them, you feel as if they are pedophiles, and you can also be one to notice the tushies and peaks the director pointed out. Teenagers or temptations, little girls or little foxes, you are never quite sure what to think of them as. The parents also seem to be very old, and the whole movie seems very dated. <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of the Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.
