So, wondering while watching this movie, did the producers of this movie save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging her "before" clothing from Miss Congeniality? Did Mrs Bullock also sleep through the role of channeling "before" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have mentioned before, the film is very formal. In addition, deja vu viewer experiences with the character Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story, and it quickly becomes a snooze party. <br /> <br /> The two killed serial killers have been done before (and better) in other movies. Like, "the good fellow partner has tried to protect his partner despite the evidence" character has been seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the film are ever more than two dimensions or are trying to be anything but trite stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering a person - even if it is a predictive murder - does not make you a serial killer. You can get the potential to become a serial killer, but you're not a serial killer or even a killer.
