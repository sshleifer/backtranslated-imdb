For months I've heard of this little movie, and now I've seen it. I find it sweet, sweet, how so many exciting directors make movies, combining others' creative ideas to make their own one-joke prerequisite for a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot in Hollywood's door then they do the right thing and they should keep it up because it's Hollywood that makes movies when combining plot sketches. How many times have you heard the phrase, "It's Animal House Meetings Back to the Future"; "It's Wall Street Meetings Dead Poet's Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and bold, not safe and predictable.
