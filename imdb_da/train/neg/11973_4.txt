This is probably one of the worst French movies I've seen so far, among more than 100 French films I've ever seen. Terrible manuscripts and very mediocre / unprofessional plays mean that the director is powerless. with all that matter no matter how good western french scene and fancy music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this movie is that these two characters DO NOT attract people like an audience, I don't care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how this movie won the jury award in cannes, man, I love almost all of the films in cannes but not this one. A big disappointment to me.
