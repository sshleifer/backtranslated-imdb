The IMDb plot collection by no means describes the essence of this movie. It should have read: "Be prepared to be catapulted back to prison by 3rd pew from your family's 8-year-old church, listen to the preacher's drone of God's will, while all you can think of has come home to your lego" . <br /> <br /> It starts well with intent, builds intrigue by planting some real and surreal traces like Renny's 'how to heal the cut of my thumb so quickly?' It then kills slowly into a Christian jamboree and Completely sacrifice his plot in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble, I think I counted the use of the word "pray" about 53 times in a five-minute tension near the end. The word to his synonym, 'prey' Unfortunately, this little mindset of me made the movie at least bearable in the last 20 minutes, plus it made me laugh when a sign would say 'prayer' ('predecessor' to me ), when it was completely new, even my k Atolian wife sunk in his chair from boredom, almost ending up on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all the salivating Christians who ranked this movie 8-10 stars, I suggest holding on to your theology-enhancing security standards like Circle Square, the Ten Commandments, everything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebral challenging topics in movies like Jesus Camp, The God who was not there, what would Jesus buy or the soon released religious. Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.
