I have given this movie an elevated rating of 2 stars which I personally think in minutes 42 and 43 in the movie .... road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene, the filmmaker offered me the immortal line - "$ 50 .. you drink and talk," but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more compelling Russian accent than I could, so I refused to take this speaker part on. I was a little starstruck, as this was my first movie experience .... and who knows ... these lines could have ended up there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Honestly, dear, I don't care" . Had I spoken one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminum as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> As time goes on, I am fortunate that my name is by no means associated with this movie. Although I spent a whole day on the set, in the South Wales hot spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual story was. The catering companies and the wardrobe lady all agreed that it seemed to have a lot of hardship and nudity in it ..... things could certainly have been worse if I ended up being naked in this most horrible movie .... <br /> <br /> Still ..... On the positive side .... I was chatting to Rhys Ifans during a break. I had no idea who he was when "Notting Hill" was not yet released, and not an incline that he could be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what a horrible pit Barry Island had been since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed that I realized I was in a quality production ........
