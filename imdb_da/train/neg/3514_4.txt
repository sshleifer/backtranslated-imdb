Philip. K. Dickian movie. And a decent one for that matter. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and the abomination called the Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's look at it, the twist and the cheese ending was a little too much for me. Halfway through the movie I already began to fear such a conclusion, and unfortunately it was quite right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No not at all. The first half (which many have already commented on) is fantastic. There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the instructor intends to convey the message that showmanship is very important in the future (we will do such a kind of thing on corny sf because we can) or is it simply that combine. But paranoia is there and feels "out of line" too. Good one.
