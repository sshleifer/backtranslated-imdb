The author / director of this movie obviously knows nothing about movies. I think DP on this project was tied and replaced with a monkey, because each set was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone to have said that this movie was made for poker players and not movie fans, someone is funny about themselves (it was probably the author / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Going into a casino and playing a few hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your daily work. And if it plays poker then you have to be hurt.
