Okay, I don't want to criticize this movie in depth. I notice the many elogic reviews ahead of me, and as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have long been reluctant to make a disappointing comment - and thus almost a year has passed. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner noise. Anyway, let the elogic voices disturb me! But for other cinephiles like me - beware. <br /> <br /> Expressed in simplest and mildest terms, here's my attitude: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and overthrow of this movie also served as a backdrop to a particular period of my life - via newspapers I read daily in my local Central European pub. At that time, I followed the news reports, but never fully understood what the heel happened. The reporter tended to report either in non-partisan terms or with a conservatism that fears any groups disturbing peace or imprisonment against the establishment. It was times when other accidents swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the United States, whose subjects I understand clearly at that time - but not dictatorship - used my papers to treat the government of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as a good wiped out "evil empire" to use flippant star wars. So, week after week, I read disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial that could give the story behind them or evaluate the dictatorship's practices and socio-economic effects, etc. So when buying this movie, I had at least two hopes: finally to understand the details that led to the social unrest and to enjoy a well-developed drama. This movie didn't give me either. <br /> <br /> The film predicts that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep feelings about the historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I would encourage Maria de Medeiro and the Portuguese film industry, but - it was thin and low. <br /> <br /> I got my copy of the DVD from France - "Committee Official Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard". The box shows smiling sharp actors, the lead gives the victory sign in a way that reminds me of more of Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French could have thought of it - but as a low-end cinema verite with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural propensity to praise it for their "honesty" but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Whatever chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm greeting? Try to describe Allende's overthrow and murder with a "warm greeting"! Try it in Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the whole range of toppings and civil uprisings! Another review: Maria de Medeiros, a renoue 'avec son, pays her son enfance a son histoire. "Dirty, waste, dirt! Least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal. Throughout Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and a country does not waste a vacuum film. I want to hang on my old VHS tapes by Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile I'm stuck in a zone 2 with the above title, which might as well go in the trash.
