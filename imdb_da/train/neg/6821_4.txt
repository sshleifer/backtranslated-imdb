It was a good story but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main story, which was not as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was too much going on and the inability to rule it all. The action was okay to cheesy, some were stronger than others, and even the stronger actors had their lesser-quality moments. It took me a few months to get through the whole movie because it didn't keep my attention and the power was just bad. I just finished watching it, and I'm glad I did when the movie finally moves and has some continuity towards the end. Again a good story, but the delivery was underpair. Would recommend it to the storyline and maybe a little eye to it, and I mean a little.
