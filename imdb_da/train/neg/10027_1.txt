The action in this movie beats Sunny Bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar holds Leonid's superpowers in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is fun. Apart from the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy, I can't see anything positive in this movie. The story looks like the author told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoor's long range with a shotgun is the slightest mistake by the director. Apart from the directors Tashan making this movie, there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry to waste my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb, or I would give it a zero.
