Yes, there are good performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in connection with a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it does. During the first 45-60 minutes, all the music takes place as a realistic achievement. Suddenly, the signs that had always spoken to each other began to sing to each other. To further confuse things a little further into, out of nowhere, they actually make about. 15 minute dialogue through song through dialogue, so seems to be releasing this idea and moving on to other things, like a song beginning in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a completely orchestrated piece with a massive invisible string. On top of all this disagreement with how music is used, the composer's clear inability to actually write music is in the style allegedly portrayed. While the first few emulate the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there's the sheer sadness of excerpts from a group making a poor Jackson family imitation, and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he began to channel Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing loudly. This was clearly one of the movies that made me appreciate how little time I have on the ground and disturbing that I wasted two hours watching this movie.
