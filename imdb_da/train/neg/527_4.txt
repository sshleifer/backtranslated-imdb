Cast to die for in a movie that is significantly smaller. Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes, she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... This is one of the movies that has the look and the expectations of being a big movie simply because they have so many good actors and actresses in it, so it seems to be something other than the pot cooker that it really is. Not bad as such, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (everybody gives good performances) you expect more than a creepy story that's a little more than a harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Wait for cable.
