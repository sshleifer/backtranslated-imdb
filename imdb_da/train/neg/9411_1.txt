Interestingly, anyone who (so far) seemed to like this movie had no expectations - I think that's the trick. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close the faces of the camera were always, I knew we were in the hands of an extreme amateur director - this is always a clear sign of them, they think it is artificial or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. However, the actors in this movie had only one facial expression each. <br /> <br /> If the dense camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the movie killed it. The movie seemed to be completely filmed in the dark. So now we know that the filmmaker was also a rank amateur. "Ooh ooh, we need to turn on the set with a flashlight! It will make it seem intimate!" No, it made it all invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the slightest hint of an idea that was never developed and no news of this kind of relationship was elucidated. (Maybe it's a new kind of movie for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie won a few film festival awards does not show the quality of film, but it overcomes the quality of These special festivals. I can assure you that this movie will not win anything in the festival where I saw it. In fact, twice during the film it seemed that it was finally over, and people began to come up (this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's "total darkness" technique). But when the film shook, there was instead a groan from the audience. And when the film finally ended, it was clear that it had no meaning whether it was actually completed on one of the two previous points. An earlier ending would have saved the audience from even more monotonous scenes of housekeeping (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring - but we figured one out in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend the audience miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie goers.
