This movie is just an excuse for the author to make a movie out of 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> Its characters are just a collection of characters with clich√©-tragic or cartoon attributes, where the sum is neurotic dialogue that Only Woody Allen could write. woman loves this because it is like looking in the mirror so they will enjoy this movie probably <br /> <br /> these movies were not enjoyed by me but because there was no car hunt and also the movie did not have any games . there were no drug guards or banners. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This movie had no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether, think of what I've said before you find yourself watching this movie. Unless of course you look like a female, you have problems with the weight. You have problems with sex and the city. and ally mcbeal then it makes sense for you.
