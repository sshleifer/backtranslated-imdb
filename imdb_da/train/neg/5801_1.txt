Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the inexplicable. He travels to this small town, saying that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing society. <br /> <br /> His car gets stuck and he takes refuge in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the city is wondering who killed this woman ... which I think was the witch, but I'm not quite sure. Ivan is now pursued by his spirit or something, and he must have confidence or something to beat it. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid history and minimal impact. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie ... but also a stranger. The Voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing because it is so high and whiny. You will not miss much by missing out on this movie.
