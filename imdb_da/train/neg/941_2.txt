This movie is simply bad. It's not even worth watching. The lunatic professor is simply annoying. Even suspending unbelievers to allow invisibility (as I am delighted to make good bad movies) and allow extremely stupid victims in a horror movie, this movie asks even more than that. If you are looking for women's shower scenes and random sexual encounters, get a porn if you are looking for a good-bad movie, get something else. If you just want to waste your time on an annoying bad movie, rent this.
