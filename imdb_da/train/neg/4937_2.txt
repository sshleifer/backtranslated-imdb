This is a 30 minute joke show. The wit, Cavemen is not treated fairly. HaHaHa !!! He can't call a phone because he's a Caveman. Cavemen is not as clever as humans. Oh, those Cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can only run out of one joke for so long, and they already have the Geico ads. This show does not deserve a time slot on the National T.V. <br /> <br /> This show is trying to be hard to be fun, but it's just not. Look at this show, I thought it was trying to be like a "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". Meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The crying cave man is annoying. The cave with the glasses is too smart to be a hollower (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can't figure out why I don't care about them.
