This film has its share of negative comments and I agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made. True, most of the movies based on King's works are pretty bad, but this goes badly into the terrible. There is not a scary moment in it unless you are considering stupidity scary. It's typically King-garbage - myths twisted around that didn't make any sense at first, mixed with obvious and trained so-called "scares" that are as shocking as PeeWee's Playhouse (which is at least entertaining). It's full of ridiculous moments, not least it's the character of Alice's War. When she goes on a rampage and starts pushing like the villain in an old Batman TV show, being sick is so absurd. All the people who had cameos in this (including John Landis) are fortunate that they still have a career. But the most absurd part must be the cat costumes at the end, which resemble cheap rubber equipment purchased from K-mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually perform the folks in the movie.
