This movie is unworthy of the Omen title. It's so bad that it has actually damaged the first three classic characters. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They don't even spell Damien Thorn's name correctly !! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all the Omen films. Pull it off the shelves and burn it.
