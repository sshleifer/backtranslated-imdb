I'm sure the people on the border between Texas and Louisiana must have had a good laugh or two when Paramount's B imagery inflicted it on the public war. Very simply the area along the Sabine River, where the film opens, is cotton land like the rest of Deep South or at least Deep South was the post Civl War. There is no big cattle at home, they are far further west in Texas, longer than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with their two partners in a river boat and when Leo Carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them to haul his cattle, they keep the cattle. And that's the start of the great Ponderosa as the ranch they start. <br /> <br /> Foster marries Dix's sister, who is played by Frances Gifford and feeds on her much smaller neighbors. They also have some additional run-ins with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, us Easterners who like westerns usually do not like geographic backgrounds, and it is still a good western from Harry Sherman's production mill that produced all the Hopalong Cassidy Westerns for Paramount. The Climax is a fiery, and I mean, literally gun battle that should have been used on an A production. <br /> <br /> But I didn't want any, but Western fans look at it.
