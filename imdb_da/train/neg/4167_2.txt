I was eager to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a great David Boreanaz fan. What I got was, however, a 1-1 / 2 hour nap. The pastor seemed pleasant: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, a business owner called "Mr. Fix It", where dumped men use their help to get their girlfriends back. Among the problems with this movie are editing, scripting and action. Although I found Boreanaz lovely in his other movie roles (with the exception of the "Crow" movie he did), it was disappointing. At times his character was interesting and others, flat. The support module reminded me of soap operas. I realize it's not a big budget movie, but some of the scene's cuts and music just didn't. <br /> <br /> My advice: Look at your own risk.
