<br /> <br /> How this movie has ever gotten a 6-star average is beyond me. Scripture is so banal, and frankly an insult to who life it is based on. The kinematics comes directly from the smooth world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott was ashamed. Demi Moore, however, shows no surprise by joining this movie if you look at her tracklist. All in all, a high concept style movie that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
