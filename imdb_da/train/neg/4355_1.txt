Terrible. I see many user comments on how big this show is. It's really a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The witnesses are lame as ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are, of course, struggling to be fun and go down when they hit the terrible punchlines (if you can call them). The majority of other users who have commented are, of course, from another planet (or at least another continent). Of course, there are reasons why broadcasters cancel shows ... and none of them are when shows are going well. Makes sense? Either way, steer clear - even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do ... go in the rain instead - more fun.
