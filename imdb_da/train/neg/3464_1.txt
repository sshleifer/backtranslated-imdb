It seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only saw it initially because it was filmed near where they live. How's that ringing endorsement? If this movie was filmed near where I lived, I wouldn't mention it in my review. It's terrible! Several reviews state that this movie is a spoof or heavy-in-kind horror movie, nor is it. It is sad to see this movie reviewed as a comedy, as it is not only a bad attempt at a horror movie, but also as a comedy. I laughed at how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie has 2 good things going for it, the mask and the selected weapon, unfortunately it would have been more interesting to see an hour and half of the mask and weapon lying on a table and then on this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also ridiculous, young and stupid. Don't bother with this movie, you've already wasted time reading this review, no longer playing this movie. Arrggghhh! It is disturbing that movies like this are done. I had expected the total cast crew to be credited to Alan Smithee, a name used when a person, usually an instructor, does not want to be credited with a movie because it is so bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing going on in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and feel I was ripped off. Avoid. 1 out of 10
