This movie should not be classified as a cinema. Although it is over 10 years old, it should never have been funded, and it is a blush on the Australian film industry, which now produces such brilliant films as "The Dish" <br /> <br /> Actors can't act, the music is .. being blunt, not music, the story is completely non-existent and is a struggle to sit through. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It's a complete waste of your time.
