From around the time Europe began to fight for World War II until the Hollywood war ended, Hollywood (with significant prodding from the government) made tons of films designed to try to get young men to catch up with the army at making a service man's life seem "cool". This is by far the hardest, meaning a soldier's life is out of work, you get the best food, and you're going to lie around all day and listen to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to have participated in World War II, but I think there was more to it. There is the best cat tip of a plot and a bunch of music tracks with some of today's leading acts. I think in 1943 even the most naive of civvies knew there was more to go overseas than the crazy hanks portrayed in this movie. Although I am sure it was supposed to be regarded as an escapist entertainment, I cannot do without wondering that family and loved ones of men fighting in the war were entertained or rejected by this trivialization of their loved ones.
