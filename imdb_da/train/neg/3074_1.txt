Even for the cocaine twisted 1980, this is a pathetic one. I do not understand why anyone will destroy celluloid, time, effort, money and audience brain cells to do such drift. If you are going to make a comedy, make it fun. If you want to film the trash can like this, keep it to yourself. If you are going to release it as a joke like this: NOT !!! I mean, it was a joke right? Someone tell me it was a joke. Please.
