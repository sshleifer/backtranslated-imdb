Some beautiful scenes, but the story itself - where a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and in making Egyptologist things in the most Egyptologist ways (eg flash photography in the tombs handling old parchment etc.) reveals a black market war and somehow (within two days, no less!) the war's jump-wearing epicenter of war becomes - more confusing than any riddle the Sphinx ever made. Down is simply horrible as the visiting British scholar (that she seems to know absolutely nothing about Egypt's culture and even less about antiques is the fault of writers, but it is annoying when everyone goes out, is her own fault entirely) and the rest of The cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seems as confused by the matter as I was. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and co. Worth looking for a ridiculously dated scene where Down rails against all male scholars accusing them of her failure as a graduate while bathing under the softest light Hollywood could muster. To top it off, she spends the next hour of the movie screaming and raging and running into the arms of every guy she can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to be Egyptologists: Take a year or two of the Arabs in elementary school. It will really help in the long run ...
