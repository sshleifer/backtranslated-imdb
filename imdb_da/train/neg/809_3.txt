I was expecting something from "K-911", I think it looked like a cute movie I could get into. I always loved the dog's comedy movie. But it looked like it was Jam's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The reason was rather lamb and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the film despite the fact that the author did not go in that direction. James has just crossed me for more than half of the movie. The dogs were the true stars, and it's pretty sad that they shone the actors. <br /> <br /> So I'm glad it's not just me at IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize that it was his brother Jim, who was the talented, no offense, but not everyone could be their star's siblings. Can't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
