A sexually occupied cook leads a double life: one as a "happy" married man with a ten-year-old child, the other as a sex prison. The majority of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently trying him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only main adult who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat "F." As it is, it is an F +, which means that it is still a mistake unless you like being bored. It is probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes to clean the garage. The "sex crime diary" falls into the category of film, which one has once seen what one wants one not to have.
