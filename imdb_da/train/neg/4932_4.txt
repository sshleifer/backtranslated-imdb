Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the very first of the series, and as part 4 it is not related to the first three except by title and the fact that it is a Santa Claus fear. <br /> <br /> Except that the ignorant, there are some obvious things going on here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and his spooky son's name is Pino. Call a bell, somebody? Now a little boy named Derek heard a knock on the door one evening and opened it to find a gift on the door for him. Although it said "not open for Christmas," he begins to open it anyway, but is stopped by his father who scolds him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself. Inside is a small red ball that sprouts santa arms and a head, and continues to kill father. Oops, maybe he should have left well enough alone. Of course, Derek is traumatized by the incident since he saw it from the stairs, but he doesn't grow up to be some killer Santa, he stops talking. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious stranger lurking around who seems very interested in the toys Joe Petto does. We even see him buy a bunch when Derek's mother takes him to the store to find a gift for him to get him out of his trauma. And what does this guy do right? Well, we're not sure, but he seems to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them cross. He keeps his landlord from postponing him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a "Larry the Larvae" outfit for his child, but of course "Larry" is not a good toy and comes out of box in the car and of course, it is not beautiful. <br /> <br /> Whatever goes on with Joe Petto and Pino, of course, it's revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a "real boy". Pino is probably more agitated and naughty because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (a smooth plastic scrap) that could account for his evil ways. And the identity of the lurking stranger is also revealed, and there is even a kind of happy ending to the slaughter. Whee. <br /> <br /> A step up from Part 4, but not much of one. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George saw some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. A few leftovers from Part 4 are also linked, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that doesn't make any difference. Yet I have now seen the whole series out of my system. Now if I could get some of it out of my brain. 4 out of 5.
