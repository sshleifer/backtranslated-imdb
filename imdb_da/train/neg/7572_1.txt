It felt like I saw this movie a thousand times before. It was completely predictable. Every time the story tried to get a little twisted every time I waited for something interesting to happen, I saw nothing but what I had expected. As "The bread factory opened another facility because there was not enough bread". In two words: Flat story that has become a clich√©, bad play, bad special effects ... Only the stupid Russian policeman, Vlad, was a little fun while punishing the evil ones. The pile of muscles was so incredibly stupid that it made me laugh for a moment. I wonder why I'm wasting my time spitting on the shame of a movie ... It won't get any worse (because it's not possible): D
