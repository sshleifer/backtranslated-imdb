Now I do not deny that when I bought this from eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredibly unnoticed work from the comedian, whom I enjoy. However, I was soon disappointed. For excuses to those who enjoyed it, but I just found Compleat Al to be very hard to see. I got a few smiles, of course, but the majority of the fun came from the music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was largely filler. You could tell that this was not Als's greatest video performance (the honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt if it will ever make the jump to DVD, so if you are an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just have to own everything, then buy the ribbon from eBay. Just don't pay too much for it.
