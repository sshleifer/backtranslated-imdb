In a way, this disaster is Fellini's work towards his entire life. The line between absurd masterpiece and free association error is very small, and which category a movie ultimately suits will often only depend on personal feelings. That said, "Casanova" left me in a cold admiration for his sets and a little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski: "Casanova also died, just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no bowel at all To say that he lived well is true, to say that I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true. The ladies usually go to the biggest fool they can find, and therefore humanity stands where it does today: We has bred the clever and lasting Casanovas, all hollow interiors that the Easter bunnies we promote on our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As far as I can do, this is the attitude Fellini takes with regard to his subject; more empathy, but in vain. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made of decay and incestuous behavior, themes that Fellini treated more nicely in "Satyricon". The sequence of the plot is characteristic of soft porn, just without the context; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy in terms of distraction. <br /> <br /> But there is perhaps only one point in portraying Casanova as a creepy fool. And I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini couldn't. More than ever, he works here as a dirty old man - a maestro, but one whose impulses satisfy more than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine an audience enjoying this movie. It was a story that wasn't worth telling.
