Okay. So there aren't really many amazing movies around. Recent gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are usually not so close together. But boy (!) Make this movie against the quality. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they did. Are the financiers in this world so convinced to fund such a crock of ****? I can just see it now ... Manufacturer - "So we have Joe Fiennes. He's cute as a button and was pretty good at Shakespeare in Love. And we have Rhys Ifans, who's not cute, but was cool in Notting Hill We blend in with a really mediocre score, a few forgettable post-Britpop tunes, hemlock clutter, and porcupine and hi presto, you have the worst movie in the new millennium, and believe me it will be hard to do anything as bad as this the next thousand years. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" I like it! Any unnecessary sex? Bad camera movements? And what about the worst accents this side of Devil's Own? "<br /> <br / > Manufacturer - "Yes, we have lots of them." The bank "sounds good, where do we sign?" <br /> <br /> please.
