Drew Barrymore is an actress who has been through bad times, not only in her career but also in her personal life. After being a wonderful child actress, she fell into obscurity with mediocre, low-quality films. While restoring the dark past, this movie remains a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days. The film starts with an interesting premise, reminiscent of Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain"; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorders that sets the story of a horror / thriller. Barrymore stars like Holly Gooding, a young woman trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past, apparently killing her other personality. <br /> <br /> Suddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to destroy her new found peace and her new, found love. In the middle of the chaos, his new girlfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly meet the demons of his past. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Palma's undervalued thriller, "Doppelganger" is mostly a mediocre movie that not only fulfills its purpose, but it also concludes in one of the worst conclusions of movie history. While Barrymore is definitely not the best, she manages to maintain her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast, however, ranges from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s, and De Palma has quite obvious influence. While the film is trying to be original by making literary references in almost every line, the dialogues are boring, and the wooden play certainly doesn't do anything good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effects. The makeup effects are made by the excellent KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. But the bizarre overuse of the effects in the out of context stops reducing the impact of KNB's work and making cheesy what in another movie would be great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for the low quality, as with a better and more coherent script it could have been an interesting movie. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre movie that gets worse every second. Worth the Barrymore beauty. 3.10
