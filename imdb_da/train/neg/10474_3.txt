The Omega Code was a model for filmographic inconsistency. There was a bit (but precious little) of good plays, primarily of the two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, the play was very bad. The baseline was rather weak, and only partly based on already questionable biblical interpretation. Certainly not one of the best of the year.
