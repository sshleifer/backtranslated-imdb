I liked the first movie, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better off the left of the drawing board. The general idea of ​​the first movie was, if not great, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first movie, and although Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a bit ridiculous. If you haven't seen any of these movies, take the first movie and forget about the followers, they can take away all the joy of the original.
