What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean, first of all, I love Seagal. I love all his movies until the mid-2000s. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. However, this does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) is expected to be a thoughtless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. But what we get is a crime mystery that borders on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. I couldn't follow this story. There are people who mutate to superhuman when taking a drug. What happened in this movie. The excess of Seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is horrible. This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him and a fun martial art where seagal turns his hands like a girl facing the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street" seagal says in this movie ... well forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!
