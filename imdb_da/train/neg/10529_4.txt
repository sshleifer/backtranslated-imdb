1. Looked at 6/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from a character development point of view, in my opinion from this very heralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There are a few good songs and a decent comic depiction, sometimes by King of Siam by Yul Brynner - but the film does not really do well to present the situation and the settings. I can only blame the manuscript and possibly some of the action why we do not fully understand the character and their situations. I know it can be a little too much to ask if a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dance, but even this part does not make much difference to me. The basic story is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things. We find out that the king is actually the largest student. There is a side forbidden romance between the King's newest wife played by Rita Moreno (a latino as an Arab - come on !!) and a former lover who causes some complications but nothing really fascinating added. Deborah Kerr, as the most important female character Annie - is OK, but neither is it convincing. The King learns some things because of her presence, and then the movie goes away as he does. This is really a minimal story with some songs and dancing, but not so great an experience for a viewer really.
