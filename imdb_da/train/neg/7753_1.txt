Everything about this movie is hog wash. Pitiful plays, horrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this movie sinks into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend leg. Robert C. is completely lost and has no idea what is going on. College kids are the worst. No trading talent at all, very stupid reasoning and just down right dumbbells. Special effects are for the birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to toy land: with stupid looking guns, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system that extends with a toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing seems to be the cause of the embarrassment of potential customers until everything is finished. The authors must be the first victims too messy with the producers and the crew. The entire film belongs to a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing. What a gem. Beliefs should see this so they can commit suicide.
