Maybe I'm outdated, or just don't know what Electra is in the current publications ... But Electra, which I read, was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She often used others to do her dirty work and more often than not a kind of double cross was involved. When you think you've figured it all out, she pulls the wool over your eyes and gets her way. <br /> <br /> This movie was rather weak on the dialogue, the action was not very convincing, and the action was spotty. I was really looking for something more in line with Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin." It is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect, where cool action was interesting at times, but more often than not history and plot was slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not threatening enough, and Electra was not ..... bitchy enough. She is the girl you love to hate ... but in this story I didn't care at all.
