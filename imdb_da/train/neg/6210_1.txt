This is the worst movie I've seen since "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment awaits you, choose to watch this. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be a big fan of you ... did you shoot this movie yourself? I seriously think what f% # k? Without giving anything away, here's the story in a vague nutshell ... You wake up, he does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alarm! Spoiler alarm! At the end of the movie .... it counts. I think part of my soul died while I was watching this movie.
