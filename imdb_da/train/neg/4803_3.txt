Adrianne, should really get a life without Mr. Brady. She torments me and has been one of the main reasons why I know more about the show. It is pretty brainless show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be subdued and analyzed to death. This makes them look / sound, they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet I know that these disagreements are all part of life. I guess some people, this is entertainment. If this happens next season, I will be sorry for what has nothing to do with their lives, but see this bin. Although I wouldn't be terribly surprised. can't even advertise this show anymore! I hope they get enough money to constantly scare themselves in front of a camera the week after the week. But the "A" girl has a heck of great beard!
