I just watched the 30th anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites ever !! Black Bart's TV pilot stunk. The reason was non-existent and the action was not good. It was, of course, an attempt to exploit the success of Blazing Saddles, and there have been television shows that have succeeded in starting big movies, but this one would never have worked. Considering that television for so many years would not even play the light signals when they washed the movie, it is unthinkable that they thought they could show a show on television with the "N" word thrown around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many famous faces !!! There were a lot of actors / actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and make a few searches. It was fun. I argued with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
