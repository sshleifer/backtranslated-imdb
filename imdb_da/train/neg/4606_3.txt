This film was an attempt to go into places most not and perhaps should not venture into. It was a similar attempt in the bizarre mainstream perspective given to us in The Cell, but not as close as in depth and good portrayed. The plot is built simply with a first campy feel to it. When the film takes its supposed "dramatic" trip, the plot falls apart, how few legs it may stand on in the first place. <br /> <br /> The reason is the idea of ​​a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He takes over the role of a hitman and kills a city auditor. Then he is not paid for his work, but instead is tortured for several days because he dreamed of the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file he had as a leverage for payment. This idiotic moves by trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is terribly and infinitely abused. He starts to become crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then he thinks that he has paid for his sins and can begin over, he visits the guy (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and wins her feelings. Immediately afterwards she discovers who he is, tragedy frames and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torture (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their former "kindness". <br /> <br /> What about Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore type movies? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything she has posted has been in this genre. Granted, I liked her in "Eight-Legged Freaks" and she was okay in "Anaconda". But despite all his obvious cuteness and allure (wow, she's hot!), She can act much better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong, and that's just a misunderstanding. For all of you out there, you will see "fully monty" of her in this movie, though it is a bit bizarre and short-lived. I almost felt that she did some soft porn after watching this movie (something not outside Kari's career). The gender simulation is such that it must enable you to wonder what is really going on during the recording. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would say there are some good plays. Don't expect much from Daniel Balwin, whose career is always destined to exploit his brother Alexs. However, the film brought out some old greats, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job of playing the protagonist, Sean Crawley. His little-acting experience, yet his credible nature as a naive youth, brings some elements of substance to the film. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't go out of my way for this one. If you get bored and tired of the same old episodes of "The Hitchhiker" then I recommend seeing this. <br /> <br /> Start off with some better movies!
