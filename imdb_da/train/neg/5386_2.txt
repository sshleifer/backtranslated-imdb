While I am one of the stars in this movie, I do not necessarily give me wisdom knowledge, I know quite a bit of what was there first ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of "incoming freshman" and being very satisfied. It was fun, sexy, raunchy, all the key requirements for a drive-in movie. you have to remember that this was shot and released before the rest of everything ... pets, porkys, etc. so in its own way this flick was really ahead of time. For any reason, the movie was given to the main dealers who edit half of the original movie and then edited in (should I say "shuffled?") The most random scenes ever. the fat guy, the people with goat heads .... what dunk was all that? I am sure it was put in for additional T&A, but it was so slowly stimulated, it caused something to happen before it grinded to a crazy and painful stop. but all in all it's a fun memory for me ... especially because I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in!
