This movie is one of the most horrible movies ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He's a singer not an actor, huh? Does he kill vampires with his guitar? And what about the terrible plot? Oh my God really sucks this movie. Finally, the Queen of Vampires is played by the Eternal Vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "amazing" slayers arrive, there are only 4 vampires left! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They run into the sun ??? And what about "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun ??? It really is a "NOT". In "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes, a single vampire is not killed with A SHOTGUN ??? This is really a lack of originality!
