This makes the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I'm increasingly not about his style. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries, and then with computer editing makes it fun with all that they are about. It's never really a direct caricature of them, and Morris seems to say most of the time, "But no, these people are really fascinating, really!" But there are always these subtle, small angular angles and not subtle editing. Techniques show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind his back. <br /> <br /> This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man studying African hairless molerates to find out they are amazing ant-like, a lion tamer , a man who holds a garden full of animal-shaped shrub and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to be about the question of what denotes animals, human and life functions? So the title Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control doesn't really seem to matter about the movie ... right? Except of course, Morris just seems a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he can call them "obsessions") that make synthetic patterns of life. I do not share the fear and honestly do not appreciate any of the connections Morris makes in the movie. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize his features. With no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewers, it is not as if Morris ever pounds the anxiety on the spectators' collective head. Instead, he often mixes circus movies and marshmallows often at times when they are taken out of the circus and ants that show some sort of collective absurdity behind what all these people are talking about. I do not find them absurd, I find them all very nice and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Unless of course he did not intend to make such assemblies, which means he is just a poor craftsman rather than a quiet overturn. Considering that none of these movies I've seen so far has particularly impressed me, I'm not really interested in finding out what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
