This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-nurses the dead. He uses it first on his brother when he's shot dead in a drive past. His brother then infects the other gang members. In some scenes the zombies are seen very slowly, and in other scenes they run pretty fast, which makes little sense. The action is mediocre, but the story does not help the movie. The makeup consists of blood on the surface of the zombies. The budget for this movie I am sure was very limited. I think the movie could have been better done if the story was more original and with a better budget. If you don't want to see a good zombie flick, you can't see this.
