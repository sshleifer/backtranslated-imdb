Survivor Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Dumped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie will not be left alone on Christmas, so he decides to return to his youth home and impose on the dysfunctional family now living there and bribe them as his family. An unpleasant and one-dimensional performance of Affleck, which works mainly with a flashy smile, makes his character as a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O'Hara draw a life in this mess. Even for farce, its silliness is timber, not very sensible from stage to stage, and its sentimental messages are as false as Affleck's grin. 91 min, Rated PG-13. * Â½
