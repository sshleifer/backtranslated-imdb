Making a movie across prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy would tax even a great movie maker .... Lucas is not the film maker. <br /> <br /> Depicting a good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Christensen is not that actress. The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of even more light saber fighting, but there is a missing edge because you already know which protagonists survive to the original Star Wars. Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very fleeting role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent! <br /> <br /> No, the movie only deals with the chancellor who turns on Jedi and has a large (long-lasting) sequence at the lava field
