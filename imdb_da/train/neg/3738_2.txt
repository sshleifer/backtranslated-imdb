That's what the title should be, anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie combines weapons, explosives and mindless kills to make a flop of an "action" movie. Let me make my point in a number of questions: Answer type agreement. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> Is that it? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is it about? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point the movie is trying to make? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters? Extremely flawless and contradictory to their own personalities. Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some great Panavision cameras to film it. <br /> <br /> If you like constant killing and greed, watch the movie. If you happen to be rejected by such a low standard "entertainment" then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum up the plot stinks, the characters are not worth theirs, the story is completely resilient, and nothing fits each other. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, the directors, and the one who helped make this movie are certainly not "Made".
