I have been an avid Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short "survivor wish" in high school, and even then he was still completely abandoned by his frighteningly brilliant "Henry Fool". But this 10-year-old successor is not only unnecessary, it is shameful. <br /> <br /> After a choppy and quick start, "Fay Grim" turns to pseudo-intellectualism, flattens out boredom and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. And that's just the plot. The majority of the new faces are so whimsical and poorly developed as the movie: a special flat character ends up with half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself, and that's his only spoken scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's agent Fulbright seems to be the only bright character (a saying that Hartley intends). How is he back then? ** SPOILER ** Dead via a car bombing that easily makes this the hilarious Hartley's most violent movie to date, and all in all wrong in a movie that's already wrong from the word goes. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Fay himself ... Well, I don't want to ruin their fate as the movie does it well enough to work with it all on its own (when it doesn't move with yet another divine canted angle, giving the disturbing impression that Hartley is moving backwards from the author to crappy movie students). This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not even good enough to save in its messiness. Instead, it obviously commits the typically fun hipster performances from its director to "the real world", a ugly and more meaningless than it should be, but not nearly ugly or mean enough to get close to having something to say. In this way, Hartley tracks all my memories of these people and the wonderful world he originally created for them. I have rarely been so depressed in the movies, and I count "Leaving Las Vegas," which at least developed fresh new characters, we grew to love before they destroyed them, rather than immediately ignoring characters that are already beloved. . <br /> <br /> Grim, actually.
