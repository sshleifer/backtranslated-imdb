I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (eg the use of color was absolutely fantastic), it was rather boring and disturbing (see father / son's incest). <br /> <br /> Also, music is absent, and if you think of the amazing soundtracks of Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenway's movies) then you can imagine the difference it makes. <br /> <br />
