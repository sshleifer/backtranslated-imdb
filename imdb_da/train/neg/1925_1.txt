Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming and teaches a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine that the manuscript calls on the best possible person so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Like Danny Devito's penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so unthinkable that any degree of comedy that can be diminished from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 Comics highlighted a grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is the angry, rare old man we've all seen at some point in a parked car mumbling to himself or stumbling toddlers in the supermarket with his stick. This Grinch is thoroughly deprived of any degree of humanity, humor or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the film calls false. Whole Movie Calling False: There is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indelible mystery as to why some of Who's has the weird lip extension and some of them do not. Unlike the 1966 comic book, I could imagine that children would find this movie tiring, annoying, and filled with conflicting messages. Are we really going to see Slutty Smurf, also Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the draft with his countless relatives. Throw the necessary butt jokes, speed jokes, six jokes, and other compulsory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie as far from the 1966 comic (or book that inspired it) that George W. Bush is from rational, clear thinking. Thumbs down on this great fat turkey.
