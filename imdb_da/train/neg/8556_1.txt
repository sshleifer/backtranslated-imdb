Okay, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm aged demographically, and I can identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes sticky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic and in another movie would have been forgivable. I try not to separate this movie as hard as possible, as the others did, but it is not so easy when the filmmakers didn't try at all. <br /> <br /> Editing in this movie is horrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you don't have to go to the film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one. <br /> <br /> The shot too ... Oh my God shoots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but we are sometimes seen in random things and in the context of editing, you will give you the most painful movie experience. <br /> <br /> This movie is made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse too. I have seen short films on youtube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what you thought, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation on both of your egos. You should be ashamed! In conclusion, this movie is a really lazy amateur porn movie if it was filled with 3 or 4 miserable sex scenes, separated by long boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If it's not your kind of thing, avoid it at all costs!
