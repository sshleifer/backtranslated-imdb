If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. MAY NOT. The film itself put me in bed. It was slow, had minimal violence and a bad use of excitement. The play was bottom lining and the plot, while it would have been cool for another movie, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only sympathetic character in the whole movie! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. Apart from that, you might want to save yourself from this movie waste.
