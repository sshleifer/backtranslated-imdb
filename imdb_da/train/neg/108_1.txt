Advantages: None <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Everything <br /> <br /> Plot Capture: A female journalist enters a hitchhiker who tells her stories of deaths from people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life have I encountered a movie so bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what appears to be about 20 bucks, the TZC is a horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetful actors who could not act to save their lives and make it more crude than scary . How does a movie like this become? Simply set, avoid the TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. My last 2 cents: Humorously, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. Their brains must really have been damaged to come up with a craptacular film like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it was up to me, this movie would get the negative bajillion rating)
