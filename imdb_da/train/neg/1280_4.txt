When I saw the name of this movie, I had always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls." It is not. It is a pudding that overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and was pried off and paved together. No music and not a period, but thoroughly unlikely. It starts with the patriarch James Woods, who tells the eldest of his three daughters, a young child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck, to maintain her family name and home. <br /> <br /> We believe it will be a historically intergenerational story. And it's a short time. Then it comes to the story of cold-hearted Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she dead to him? Well, why else? As we learn in a strange flashback sequence told by Stanwyck, she had once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters as well as herself of course) by marrying. She hit a person she took to be a bumpkin, who was actually budding lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> Let someone think of the child they had, a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot, is - well you know ... They had a quick marriage and in the very short time they were together he was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with a painter Gig Young, played by Gig Young. The other sister is trying to take him away. Etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It's a peeling, unengaging root - well enough, but without a bunch of logic or plausibility.
