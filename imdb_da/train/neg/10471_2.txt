Frankly, the Omega code is the worst movie I've seen for a very long time. During the first 30 minutes, I was stunned in my seat and tried to determine if I should claim a refund. But since I hadn't paid to see it in the first place (passing), I figured I might as well stay. And I didn't think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> It did. I will quickly run through the low points (include some spoilers): The terrible miscasting of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. The characterization was inconsistent; For example, despite his credentials, Lane is a complete nitwit. Then there is the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies; We see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code. Also, horrible "action" sequences: Lane escapes from difficult situations with no explanation, and the one time Lane actually seems to be in danger, turns out to be a dream sequence! It is cute for grammar school assignments, but it is an inexplicable plot unit in a movie image. Pacing was bad: After a long opener, the first third of the movie changes every 90 seconds. Later, pacing is improved, but there is still too much unnecessary jumping around. And as someone else mentioned, even years (not even Lane's young daughter) pass years. It was disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good things. The quality of the film (eg lack of grain) is high and very attractive. Outdoor shots were well finished and the location shot added a touch of realism. There is also a moment in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God to help him - it turned out to be quite exciting - even for me, one who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked it because it hit me as the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was followed by greater incomprehensibility. People, dialogue, direction and acting were ALL poorly finished. Michael Ironside had nothing to do and Michael York was just odd. I think the producers would do too much; If the plot had become tighter and more focused, and the characterization more complex, the film would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the Omega code is disappointing. Definitely did not pay to see this. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
