I really hope the Concorde / New Horizons didn't try to make a serious horror, or even action movie, when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is flat out stupid from start to finish. Even humor in C3 is fun because it's bad. Definitely a high watermark in 'So bad is the good' genre. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, it's for you.
