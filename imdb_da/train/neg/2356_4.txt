The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11 around, the film industry decided to take advantage of the fact that spies were around. The movie is fun to watch because of Eleanor Powell's amazing dances. The late Miss Powell was definitely a great hoofer in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton here. The two also starred in "I Kill It." Moroni Olsen, who three years later, was fantastic when the inquire police officer in "Mildred Pierce" again looks like an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. The problem is that Olsen and his rogues really are the Japanese spies. Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self here, and he gets ample support from Virginia O'Brien.
