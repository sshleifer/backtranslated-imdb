This movie may be daunting on advertising, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. This is a below-average (even lower than that) and has no plot. I think every house can make you feel scared and sure that a dead Japanese woman would scare you out of you, but then what? Make a movie that would appeal to viewers and not just show pictures of scared people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say "terribly rip-off of Samara (The Ring)"? Don't let me get started with the "dead child". Not even that scary! So what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, great freaking deal! Just bury the poor zombies and scare some lives that have the potential to be harmed by Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
