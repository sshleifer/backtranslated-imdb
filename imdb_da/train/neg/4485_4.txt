It looks as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic return to perform a strange phenomenon that emerges from long serial novels. This is where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) takes you away with an action packed revolutionary story. The successors, however, take that universe and lead you down the ocean path to whatever new social or political comments the author wants to make. Matrix is ​​finally the film equivalent. The matrix stands tall, only as an interesting film with a strange twist in the middle. When you see this account just sitting there and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the authors and directors will guide you through what should be some of the most painful monologues and non-action sequences in SciFi. While the images remain so amazing from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters fall terribly flat into the sequel. Watch for eye cakes, not too deep thoughts. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 registered on this fine website.
