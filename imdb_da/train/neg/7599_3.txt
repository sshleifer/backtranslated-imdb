A friend told me about John Fante last summer after we entered a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I didn't know that Fante was a favorite author of Bukowski's - a writer with similar edge and humor apart from a generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it is still one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer who made up for himself and the outside world as a compelling, masterfully talented writer who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the grace of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer, and how he eventually returns with nothing, but the story of his failed attempt at love is bitter and genuine without touching Hollywood End. The movie adaptation remains true to the book for some time, but winds its way into the cinematic trap of love unfolding through racism, disease, and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a dunk and Camilla is fabulous, and their love was never and never the right thing, no matter how much one of them wanted to find it in one another. This movie released the real meaning of the story and replaced it with schlock. I can't believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about what made it so wrong.
