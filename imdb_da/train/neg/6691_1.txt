MY EYES! IN GAMES NAME AND ALL IT'S LOVELY, MAKE ME UNSEE THIS MOVIE! which substances are you people on! This could well be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad acid trip all the time, I need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From the beginning to the end, glow cables are an unfortunate masterpiece of satanic cinema. when I thought to watch this movie with my Jewish best friend and family, we thought, "Oh hey, it might be fun! It'll be bad, but still a little funny" how wrong we were, we weren't prepared for where Terrible this movie could be. All my friends set up for lobotomies as soon as the movie was over, and during the movie, one of my friends tried to stick with the belt while another tried to split his wrist with a wooden spoon. I wish I had watched the video from The Ring instead, that way the pain and suffering was over in just seven short days. For anyone who wants to watch this movie, you are not prepared! You may think you are a kind of "hard guy" by renting this, but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and urinate on you.
