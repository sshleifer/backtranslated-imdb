This movie was announced on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every problem. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. But oh, how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood-style movie about a movie in a movie. News shows so clearly that we are not ready to produce 'big Hollywood movies'. I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject line says, it's nothing and then looped. You could just stare at the television without seeing anything. It was the feeling we have when we saw nuances. Shades is a poor production !!!
