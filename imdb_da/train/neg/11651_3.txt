Considering that this movie was put together in less than a year, it could explain its briefness (81 minutes - including final credits, so about 76 minutes of actual film). But what it can't explain is its lack of humor as the previous movie had. <br /> <br /> Gags are fast and sometimes not even fun. The only true fun parts are the fast spoofs at Nike basketball spots, James Woods' depiction of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and pieces and scattered throughout the film. Very unfunny was the start of Charlie's Angels, which, like the first Scary Movie and Matrix spin off stage, thoroughly restored the scene without much humor introduced into it. <br /> <br /> Today's youth may not be able to relate to the spoofag of the classic supernatural horror films from the 70s as the exorcist and perhaps from the 80s' Poltergeist, et. eel. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Scary Movie 3 will take some time to assemble, making spoofs easier. <br /> <br /> One thing is that the movie has more than the last promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a "3" out of "10".
