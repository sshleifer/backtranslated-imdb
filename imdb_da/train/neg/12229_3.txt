This movie started well, I felt I saw an adult version of Seinfeld. Very quickly, I began to question situations and actions of the protagonists and found no answer as to why they did what they did. All the plays were amazing, but few scenes had short moments where they were actually fun. Dan Cortese was fantastic. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this movie to casting agents. See the first few scenes and then find something better, otherwise you find yourself completely lost in this mess. I found this in a bin in a video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the knowledge of this movie I would like it to be a good price.
