... and I actually gave it a zero on my personal 1-10 scale. I've been to movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater (I do not consider movies that I only watch on TV). This is the only movie I have ever judged ZERO. My wife and I took our four children (aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who warned me on this site (surprised that the movie had a total rating of 4+). Dinosaur animation looked amateurish at the time (and even worse in demand), the action (especially by Sean Young) is terrible and the story is simply stupid. <br /> <br />
