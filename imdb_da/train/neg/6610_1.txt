This movie should not be seen as it was supposed to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of the classic Bollywood movie "Sholay", but having trouble with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and ... I guess letting all the good parts of the movie ( play, script, songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and shoot the movie just because he is already hiring the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he took a Coppola (Godfather) on us; What did you think of RGV? Anyways, the story is, even though it's hard to follow, almost like the old sholay. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay, sholay). Both "bad but fun" friends help a policeman catch a bad guy first. Later in the movie, now retired policeman hires them as personal security and protects from the hands of a most sought after Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. If you haven't seen Bollywood movies, they'll win the Good in the end. There I just saved you 3 precious hours in your life!
