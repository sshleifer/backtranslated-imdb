"Magnolia" is an enchanting, confusing play that adds little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a speechless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera strikes through corridors and corridors and catches glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to look after these people? The common theme seems to be people who shout a lot that can't look after others (except for John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks that either break or die. I was reminded how much I didn't like "Shine" because of the irreversible monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing signs here, why would we like to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> That said, there is nothing detained about "Magnolia". Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are being sprayed on his canvas with surrender. There are especially two ideas that bomb. Both occur in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. You have the camera flashing from one sign to another while each one sings one of the Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffective as we cannot see what strictly all of them are. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. "Magnolia" has a lot of good actors. Especially Tom Cruise, who releases a performance, I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly might play the most decent and really good cop in the latest memory. But it all adds nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theater couldn't hold it any more and said, "This is stupid!" My feeling is that the majority of movie guests will agree.
