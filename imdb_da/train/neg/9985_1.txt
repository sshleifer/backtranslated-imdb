Have I ever seen a movie more shockingly unfortunate? I can think of masses similar to this, but no one manages to overcome it. Cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved in doing this. Each of them carries an expression of fear that is not generated by the plot, but by recognizing that this project can easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Mrs Diaz do not provide a sufficient reason to submit to this. Avoid, of course, it's a style of movie that the Americans haven't really understood. See the final result if you are going and you want to see what I'm talking about, but don't say I didn't warn you ...
