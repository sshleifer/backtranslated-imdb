I read all these reviews here on how such a good movie is. Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. The play was below average most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I have not seen a more pathetic attempt to make any "badass" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a letdown. I also read somewhere, this can be a cult classic. I know there are supporters of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of film. The writing was paralyzed, mostly the actor was lamb, this film was paralyzed. <Br /> <br /> Oh and pray for the guy who used to be in the bowl. He looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
