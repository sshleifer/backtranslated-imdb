Dewaana as a movie goes through the usual clich√©s. Man and woman fall in love and marry, man is apparently killed by a family friend who wants their family happiness, woman's smear and surprise surprise man no 1 reappears. The film is reminiscent of Yash Chopras Chandni and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri as villain goes through the movements and is no more than a standard bollywood villain The music of Nadeem Shravan is amazing, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is a regular movie that goes through the movements.
