I rate this movie with 3 skulls, only the coz girls knew how to scream, it could have been a better movie if the actors were better, the twins were ok, I thought they were evil, but the oldest and youngest brother they really sucked bad, it seemed that they read the scripts instead of shopping them ... spoiler: if they are vampires why do they freeze the blood? Vampires can't drink frozen blood, says the sister in the movie let's drink her while she is alive .... but then as they move to another house, they take a cooler, they are frozen blood. the end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> It was a great waste of time and it made me mad, I read all the reviews of how this movie was great, how many awards this movie won, and this movie was f * *** s ** t !!!!
