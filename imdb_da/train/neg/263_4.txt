After a day of work I sat down to relax and turn on the movie channels. The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot movement made me stand up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given to appear in this movie, it should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, you are not planning to impress your friends by choosing this as a rental for a movie night.
