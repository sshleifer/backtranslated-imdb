Have the in-laws for the weekend? Then it is the movie to speed up their departure, if not, that it will cause a catatonic state to bring about a successful relief from constant nagging. The movie is apparently put aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is more super-engineered car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average pillar and a castings deepened from the depth of the celebrity D list. An interesting piece of extra rides plays "Spot the Villain" as passengers join the ship. You won't be wrong !!!! With a script sinking faster than a brick, clich√©d pieces and abundant amounts of raspberry jam as blood, this film tries to include the genre of thriller, action movie and gore party and at the same time fails to fulfill any of them. <Br /> <br /> One should watch movies if just laughing, how bad it is.
