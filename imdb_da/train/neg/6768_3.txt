Herbie, Volkswagen, who seems to be a man, is back and is now run by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman hoping to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that stands in the way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do everything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love error was not so good. Even as a child, I don't remember much. However, I had hoped for the successor. I think the throw is pretty good, and the trailer makes it a really fun movie. Unfortunately Herbie is no better now than he was before. The movie is incredibly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids, but that's all. I realize that it is a children's film and everyone, but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring at the end. Most of the actors also appeared dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was okay as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances as in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. He was very good as the bad guy, even though he didn't have much to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they do nothing special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson leads and she does an okay job. She tries to keep the film interesting, but she works with a weak manuscript. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two still make light films, but they really do not make the stories interesting or fun. It is not entirely their fault, but hopefully the next time they will try harder. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie worth seeing if you are a child. Everyone else is better off skipping it. Rating 4/10
