Interesting to read comments from viewers about Omega code ... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from TBN broadcasts ... the movie looks like it was made to go straight to the video, to stay Stocks beyond the three-party rapture series made by another religious group in the 70s. Don't remember? You will not remember this one in a year or two. This is the first movie I have ever seen where it was understood that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... it just shows that if you are a TV channel singer, you can also play Hollywood producer with a lil ole ladies 10th money ...
