Sean Bean is great, like photography, placements and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat muddled and the conclusion flat. The reason has been significantly changed from Cornwell's novel, and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than seen. Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here as opposed to his literary alter ego, which seems more intelligent and determined despite its fears in its new role as an officer promoted from the series. I really enjoyed the short scene where Sharpe is triggered by a "real" officer, and after a quick break and piercing, he stares back at the surprised and cowed officer. It sets the tone for its later attempts as a commander. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" or "10."
