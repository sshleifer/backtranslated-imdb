I've seen the Gator Bait movies and it's almost the same as them. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exaggerates her vicious revenge on each of them. What sets this movie apart from them (though not very far) is that sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second it's ever sexy. Some of the rapes may seem a bit widespread, but it is only because the film is trying to strengthen the public's need to see this woman seek revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a faint movie, it has no other way of maintaining interest in others than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman's revenge on his attackers. I spit on your grave is not the kind of movie you expect to deliver a serious morality, but I was happy to see it as it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted on the woman's lead, it was not meant to pass as a movie and movie . <br /> <br /> B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and uncontrolled youth sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity doesn't run the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs, just as they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the authors seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason why the movie can never be any more Than a pointless B movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it just fulfills the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through sexual assaults. It is strange that the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (but not too much), but it is by far the most painful to see. We are even let down a bit as we see the woman getting revenge when a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were of course impossible (it seems to be fortunate that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hugging the engine on the boat and pushing his genitals against the propeller, remains that way while the woman shouts some final words on him and pulls the cord), but again this film only fulfills the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know this is all that the movie means, as it literally ends the moment the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she does not write her book, she does not go and never returns to the nightmare place, she just comes in the boat and engines around the lake, while the movie just stops in the tracks. But what more did you expect? <br /> <br /> Did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try to find someone who is broken or burned. I was really looking forward to them?
