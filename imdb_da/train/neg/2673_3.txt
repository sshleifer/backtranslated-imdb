Not long enough to be functional length and not abruptly enough for a card, this thing exists for a reason, having a lesbian three-way. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie. Misty fits nicely into her outfit and is a very nice girl, and when people are so pampered with a game character like Lara Croft that they make naked calendars of her, you know that a soft knob is able to explode. Unfortunately, this is quite pathetic. Especially the painfully false sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand, slips air. See this if you just can't get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a lovely blonde and has a jerman accent ever.
