My life is about saving animals. I work voluntarily with a rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian because I couldn't kill an animal myself to sustain my life. I can't even kill a spider I put it outdoors. The scene where the children throw stones at the bird until it dies, with Earlier joining in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and have haunted me since then. It simply convinces me that people are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The conclusion - the foster parents adopt faster - does not redeem the depiction of animal abuse. Why does anyone want their child to watch this movie?
