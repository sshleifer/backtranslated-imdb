America needs the best man possible to win the "game", so who is taking advantage of it? A gymnast (Oh brother!) The game of Kurt Thomas, who has the necessary skills to win in a game involving ninjas, a village crazies and Richard Norton, as Kurt Thomas tells "to keep his hardware in his pants". (His exact word) I missed this in theaters, and that's a good reason, because I would probably have been kicked out because of the grin I broke into at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my heart was just how paralyzed these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4, and he hardly hits someone like "The best man for the job" As for Kurt Thomas acting talent, so good, if you can't say anything good ... In all seriousness, though you have to wonder where much cocaine was used to give an idea so stupid. Only the decision to throw Tara Reid as a scientist at the top of the stupidity here. For 18 years, however, this was the title of the stupid movie I had ever seen. Not to say that I didn't find this insurmountable, I laughed so hard that I nearly quit death. Twice. Only in the 80s could a movie with such a bad idea be made. Although for the record that is the only movie ever to have such a wimpy, he can't even pull a squeezed sword out of the ground. This is the sharpest action movie ever made and one of the most hilarious too. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
