Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for wasting movies to be reused as toilet paper, recently destroyed my confidence in the movie's art. First of all, it was made. Second, people went to see it. Third, some people voted the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure it would be 1 billion times as well. Most crappy movies have their moments (even Godzilla had a few special effects). This movie is the moment I left the theater unmoved. The only thing that could have made this movie worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to stare at the crap for an hour and a half, I take a dump in a can. If someone does not completely despise this movie, I apologize to you and your children and to the children of your children; However, unlike Springer's beliefs, I clearly do not warn children having sex.
