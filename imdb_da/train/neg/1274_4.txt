This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and equally lovely Olympia Dukakis. It would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead, it is a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a small falcon thrown in. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you almost wouldn't know. I suppose Reiser is under the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs a suitable vehicle. He is not. Even more madman is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best female actresses on the screen today and then pushed them all in his background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen lights up. The story is about Falk and Dukakis really, but we are exposed to a meaningless, silly and prevented road trip where Reiser gets to show how much sweet, precious and so deep with psychological insight (wrong!) He can be. For example, in a restaurant scene that I imagine Reiser had hoped was "Cassavetes-like" there is a ridiculously false confrontation between Reiser and Falk, which is so incredibly ridiculous, I was embarrassed by Falk.
