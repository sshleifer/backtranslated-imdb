The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are completely acceptable and surprisingly watchful. The signs are trustworthy and interesting. The cloning laboratory looks really high tech. Then everything collapses. The characters begin to behave idiotically, and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor (and this is supposedly "present-day") goes critically, the only plot reason being that it is necessary to kill the dragon - it just doesn't ' t. The goal is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a movie that started so well, so wrong. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians.
