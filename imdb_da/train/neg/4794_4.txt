Why watch it here? There is only one reason, and that is for John Saxon grandeur. I love his acting. My most preferred look of him is in Nightmare On Elm Street 1.3 and 7 as Nancy's father a policeman, Black Christmas as a policeman and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. When I shook through my local shopping mall outlet, I came across the movie Zombie Death House, and I quickly threw it back, but before moving on, I noticed that John Saxon was not just an actor in this movie, but for the first time I've ever heard of a director. This fascinated me (also the cheap price of $ 9.00) and I and I had to. When I got home, I realized that this movie didn't live up to Sakson's other work, even his acting, which may have been confused by the extra pressure being led. But it wasn't just him, the other actors also sucked. It seemed like they had all been pulled out of a recent porn shoot and now told you to really act. The movie even looks out of 80s porn quality. I cannot in good faith recommend this movie to casual viewers, but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80s who missed the culture that came from that era by being born late, or a fan of crap movies than this one is for. Also if you dig John Saxon as I do.
