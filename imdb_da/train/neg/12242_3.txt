I expected a bad movie and got a bad movie. But I couldn't really imagine in my worst imagination how bad this movie was. I won't even try to explain what Blood Surf is all about. It's not about surfing, but a great $ crocodile. They were complaining about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was clever and didn't show the shark to the end. Here the crocodile is shown many times, and it is the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen and they are not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile see Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the opportunity to make an original surf film, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? Not really, it got some nudity and a sex scene taken straight out of a playboy movie. The action is also not half bad, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she doesn't take her out. The main players are also not bad. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started well with some great surf scenes. The blame is the unnamed author and director. The dialogue is one of the worst things I have ever seen, and the script is very poorly written, and the director has no talent whatsoever, nor much of a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Don't see it. Although you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. See Sirens to see Kate Nude and see Lake Placid if you want good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but is bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good work on the piece of sh # t they had to work with.
