I do not expect this to be a good movie, but I also do not expect it to be so terrible. I hated the mother character so much that I had to turn the channel. I returned it, hoping it was only part of the movie, but no. And for the daughter to sit there, is he embarrassed or almost gone out of a job or run mad at his own home? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would quickly put her in the nearest hotel if she was annoying in my house. After all, I was following a set of rules in my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy any of it. I tried to give more chances, I really did. Pardon.
