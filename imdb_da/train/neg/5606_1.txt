I think Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. I think he (the lady) protests too much. It all sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He places profane literature (scriptures from the same time period but not associated with the Bible) a number of times, but I can think of at least three references from the top of my head that give historical accuracy to events contained in the Bible. Everyone can skew data and prove something they like, but it doesn't. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look in English and German, where it is clearly a common root) Nothing stays the same, it always grows and changes. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is the one I found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice that there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be lost and the average of the whole verse changed. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without space, without punctuation, without paragraphs, and without numerical verses. These fonts resemble a long word and the translators added all of the above. For example, how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read what God is nowhere or do you read what God is now here? Same string of letters two completely different meanings. Therefore, many Biblical scholars use a "encyclopedia" to help them with translation, as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the script was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translating into symbolic logic, one can prove that God exists, but one cannot prove that he does not exist! Finally, I just love listening to people who think they are so clever that they are qualified to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Put soapbox away, God Bless Maegi
