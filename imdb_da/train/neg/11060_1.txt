It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of America's most infamous serial killers, but unfortunately it doesn't even come close. Terrible editing, direction, bad acting you called it. This film is literally about. The 10 minute plot stretched in 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson's father, but it's not so much enough to save this stink. A 1 out of 10.
