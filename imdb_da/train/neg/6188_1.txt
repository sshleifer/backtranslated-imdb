This is by far the worst fit of Jane Eyre I've seen. It is uncertain whether the writer's writer has ever read the book by Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling like Rochester - when it's not just plain old-fashioned angry. Susannah York has the most dated 1970s hairstyle I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly speak to each other, so the rich snail is enjoying the book that is the basis of their deep intellectual and related love. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent the Timothy Dalton version instead. It's so true in the book, it's like having the novel read aloud to you. Dalton is great as Rochester. G. C. Scott is ridiculous.
