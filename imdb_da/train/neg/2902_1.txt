Spoiler: Flock of passive aggressive people who have family reunification. Scripture has them saying and doing things people would never do, at least someone with a sharpness of decency. The hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul collector at a bookstore, the day of reunification, unaware that she will appear as her brother's boyfriend at the reunion. He tries to postpone his brother's demands, but knowing that our hero is clearly opposed to her plagues him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper, rubbing over the brother with an excuse that she shows him how stretch. At one point, she actually detests and goes into a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart is breaking. She thinks it's fun until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really draws. The audience coughed and fidgeted way through the long haul. Scripture is unintelligible and incredible. We almost went out, but kept thinking that something would happen, but that would appreciate things. All the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, in addition to popping poor suckers like me to see the crap like this. Does it compare with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, the authors, the actors, the producers and the theaters to make it so badly the screen!
