Although I do not claim to be any expert in marine life, I have to say that anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not buy into this notion of a whale (and not even the mother!) Have a clue about revenge because it knew that his death mate had a forced abortion of people! I really mean! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been extremely difficult for roles to have accepted this unwanted. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would feel like demanding your money back.
