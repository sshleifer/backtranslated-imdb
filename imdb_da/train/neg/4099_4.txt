Mulva is put in sugercoma by Teen Ape. When she wakes up she is considerably warmer (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel) and out of revenge on those who made her wrong. As subtitle and box art entails this is actually the start of the "Kill Bill" movies, but it's a Chris Seavers movie, it's a wildly incompetent satire (and I use the last period extremely loose). I would love to say this is better than the first movie, but the truth is being told that I was so full of my ass when I saw the previous movie that I didn't even hope to compare the two at this time. But I must have enjoyed it since I bought the sequel (see when I am drunk, I like it, for lack of a better word, complete and total crappy movie) There are a few laughs very (very few) but I remember the Bonejack gets more fun though. Well at least just over an hour, it is over-fast for what it is worth. <br /> <br /> My character: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Sound comments by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and Lbp gang; Other comment from Seaver; 31 minute Making of featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute tribute to low budget images; False 2 minute commercial syrup; stills gallery; Promo trailer; and trailers for: Mulva "," Quest for the Egg Salad "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2, & 3;" Feral Man "," Bonesetter "," Midnight Skater "," Demon Summer "&" Splatter Rampage Wrestling "
