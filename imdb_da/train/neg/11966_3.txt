Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is a creepy comic book built of shaky puns and one or two great moments. Set in Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an unpleasant area between a standard black 'n' white Porky cartoon and one of the books that come to life Merrie Melodies that was popular at the time. Typically of many of the early Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star that only appears in a straight stuttered open song and climax of the movie. For the rest of the time, the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he negotiated. Unfortunately, the audience is much smaller than they negotiated. As was sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series, the spotlight was thrown on purses signs that could have worked just as well in a non-animated medium. Drawers are scarce, and even though the comic is only saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is little to ever recommend 'Porky's Poor Fish' over any of the other under-pair early Porky cartoons.
