The revolution is a horrible movie, I don't care if you are a history teacher, news writer, Al Pacino fan, there is no way that this movie might serve a legitimate '10'. The key point to the plot is empty dobb (al) trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat. Everything is about that note. Tom's son joins the army to make up for the note, so Tom also joins the army, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later, the war is over and they can finally turn in the note to their boat. The end. <br /> <br /> It had some fighting scenes, and at best they were pretty mediocre. Transitions between scenes used "five months later" and set the characters magically in a famous historical battle. The love story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow. Then save your "Notes" and see Patriot instead.
