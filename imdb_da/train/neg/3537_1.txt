Convinced the world that he did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that is probably remembered by many people. It is from the usual suspects of course in relation to Kaiser Gold .. I mean Sose .. I got another such: -This stupid trick that an instructor has ever drawn tried to convince an audience he actually had a story <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the coolest movies I've seen for a long time. It starts out so well with really great movies, great plays and a very smart premise. But unfortunately, the only way this movie is going is a self-crime course. And it does, not with a single stroke, but with small small wrist cuts. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here that are wondering that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough spirits in my brain I would probably be able to explain the existence of humanity in a very probable degree. I've seen and read about a dozen completely different ways people explained the story. And they differ from a story that is completely upside down, playing chess with itself, for a cunning way for a criminal to play his enemies like chess games. <br /> <br /> And that's all jolly swell. But at the same time, it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And besides that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we don't have to deal with friendly loans here "It's a blatant robbery. What ultimately goes wrong in this movie is that the storylin swirls like a full bum of speed. If this movie was a roller coaster ride, you would have crashed into the attraction next door. the shorty after leaving, there are so many twists in this movie that will never be solved that if it was a cocktail, you would need a life-supply of foaming to work in nausea after drinking it. have ever been explained, and when you finally get an understanding of the direction you think it is going, you are pulled in yet another. <br /> <br /> I think this story didn't go anywhere paper and Ritchy must have thought that making a movie was great It anyway, be the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely offend one's own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could easily have been a gem instead becomes a constructive work of art, food for pseudo-intellectuals to debate on sundayafternoon debates clubs. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
