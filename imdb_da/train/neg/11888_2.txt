Making movies about the supposed end of the world should be some facts and realism 1. We are never told why these people believe in this. 2. Location is New Year's Eve in Toronto Canada. SO PLEASE TAKE A COUNTRY WHY SCHOOL THE GENERAL SHINING ON MIDNIGHT & WHY (based on the costumes) DID THE SEEM SEE SEPTEMBER <br /> <br /> 3. The action was in the neo-natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The individual story pieces were all boring and without any purpose. I could go on, but I won't make this as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on the IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thank you as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
