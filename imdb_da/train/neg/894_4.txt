Just like that yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before I arrived, I came here to see how it was judged, and then it was 7.4, a nice good bet ... After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did it) but felt I was embarrassed to do so when the film's producer was in the screening. I did not like, the dialogues are superficial and look nowhere, the signs are lower than the dialogues, no lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: lots of Siemens and organics advertising on the film. Despite the fact that I have already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet, and Siemens mobile is constantly popping up on her lap; or another character who has a bath or cut her hair just to have Organics shampoo appear huge on the screen! All this would be tolerable if the plot, the characters, the romantic, everything was good, but was bad, really bad! A "don't know how to do" sex-in-town. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money.
