It took 9 years to complete this film. I think that within the 9 years someone would have said, hi, this movie is horrible. I've seen better performing in porn movies. The story is tired and the game. Abused child becomes serial killer. What about something new for a change. What about an abused child becomes a florist? At least it would have been a new twist. Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially non-original movie ideas) think they can be an instructor? I admire the fact that they are stuck in this movie for 9 years to finish it. It shows endurance and spirit. With this kind of driving hopefully the next time they can focus it on a better script. If you want to see an erroneous experiment in indie film from a writer / director from Michigan, see Hatred of A Minute. If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / director stick with the Evil Dead.
