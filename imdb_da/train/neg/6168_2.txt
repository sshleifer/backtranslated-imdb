Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... okay, two of my friends and me, we ordered Pizza, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something brainless but fun like Versus. But naked blood sucked. It's a complete waste. Okay, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is excellent. But it is. Nothing more, nothing less. I don't want to sum up the plot, other people already did, I just wanted to stop the hype. But see it and judge for yourself. Maybe we can push the score where it will be. One thing that comes to my mind: The soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - okay, John's cool ... :) 2/10
