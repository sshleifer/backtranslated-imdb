A young basketball playing professor of genetics conducts research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He is pressured to complete his research because he has not published, so the university has trouble justifying financing him (I think). He makes a test injection on a monkey who quickly dies. He then tries it on himself. He starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; She is the one who had demanded research results. <br /> <br /> Originally, he did not seem to have any effects from the injection, except for a new strength. He then realizes that he had little memory loss and begins to remember what happened. In addition, he begins to seem very unhealthy. When the film is called metamorphosis, he eventually changes into something else. You will not believe in your eyes - either what he became or the absolute crazy costume that the actor is wearing to portray what he has been transformed into. Amazingly, there is a further change in the store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd. About the only thing this movie has on its way is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small portion. <br /> <br /> I had once seen a video box for this with a sculpted plastic mold glued to the box box. Maybe it could even have had some electronics in it at once, maybe eyes that light up (the main character's eyes sometimes turn green into the movie). The copy I was looking at had a box showing only tear marks where the glue had held onto the plastic that had been removed. Novelty Boxcover, if it still had it, would have been the only reason I would have kept on this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of it.
