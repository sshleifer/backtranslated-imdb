I tried to watch this movie twice, and both times I still couldn't make it to the final credits. The first time I managed to sit through the first battle sequence, I lost interest. The second time managed to force me to digest within an hour worth of creepy action, lame SFX and extremely poor direction. Pallet in relation to original. <br /> <br /> Anyone ever hear about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who haven't let me fill you up. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time ... Atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and economically painful story short, the game floated a great deal and resulted in thousands of thousands of Atari 2600 ET games being dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away, let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What does Universal Soldier: The Returning to This Story Have? Look at 3.2 rating and find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie ... IMDb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems don't go as low as 0 or even into the negatives.
