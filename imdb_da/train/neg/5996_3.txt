Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Cast: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds are GO! <br /> <br /> Then began Thunderbirds, a childhood favorite of mine. When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbird movie, I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to see Thunderbird 2 amused to save people while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the idea. I just couldn't wait. Then came August 2004 when the film was finally released. Critics panned it, but I would still go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, it was all that was important to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50? Everyone else was over thirty and under ten. Probably the most awkward theater experience I've ever had ?? <br /> <br /> The movie (intended to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days and wants to save people like the rest of the family, but he is too young. One day he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) traps the rest of his family on the Thunderbird 5 (space station). That means he has to throw Hood's henchmen and save his family in time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. When it gets put on film? What a mess we have on our hands. First, the movie was for children, just like the original show was. But Gerry Anderson treated us as adults and gave us lots that were quite advanced for children's programming. This, however, falls into the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise. The end product is a movie that tries to appeal to the Thunderbirds series and kids fans, while both are completely missing. Lame jokes, cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really enjoys are all this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wants him to never have corrected it. <br /> <br /> Over all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering the script that they were all given. Ben Kingsley was unusual as The Hood played the game extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood's craftsmanship, which is reduced to remnants of old Looney Tunes cartoons that stumble, which, surprisingly, take the kids with ease. What is strange about this? movie is it while i watched the movie, i had fun. But when the lights went up, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I was $ 8 lighter, and two hours of my time was gone. A guilty pleasure? Maybe. Nevertheless, Thunderbird's is an unforgettable mess. Instead of a big "go" I recommend staying away from this movie. If the rest of the movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it, it would have been an incredible movie worthy of Thunderbird's name. However, we get a movie that only deadly Thunderbirds fans (if you want to see your childhood torn apart) or the extremely boring should bother. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
