I felt this movie started well. The action was spot on, and I felt for all of the character's situation, even though the true family unit was not completely revealed. We never got enough information about the danger of really feeling his pain for his entire engagement or building for his enmity with Tobe. I mean in a scene that you see him admire her for density and in another scene he almost shakes his head. Another problem with the movie was just unraveled and lost all the focus at the end and I prayed that it was just over. Any movie with such an elongated and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or more just for the actor. We look at it all over the quality of the movie experience. In the case of this movie, the ending is so bad that I seriously considered just going out of the theater. This movie pulled me in and just spat me out.
