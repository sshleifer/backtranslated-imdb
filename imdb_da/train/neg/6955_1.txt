I fail to see the appeal of this series (which must be sci-fi). It's really just "let's see what soap operatively happens this week" and oh, the Cylon is involved through flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Cylon "babe" holding nails on the other guy is pretty sorry, it's pretty obvious that T&A was added to the show. Every time she pops up, I'm confused that the WTF should continue. And try not to hesitate with me about "history arches". <br /> <br /> It is a soap opera with some CGI slots. This is not science fiction except for the original premise. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that it is earned to be. If you like trendy, edgy, risky, jumping, guard editor-on-crack camera work, this show may be for you. As nerds seem to be ravishing about this show, it is a clear indication that vocalist's opinions have changed from Picard's TNG.
