A sequel to (actually remake) Disney's 1996 live-action remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being "cured" by her occupation of coat by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But "cure" is broken when Cruella hears Big Ben's toll and she once again goes on a crazy quest to make herself the perfect coat of dalmation hides. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it is a "Thanksgiving Family Schlock" movie designed to suck all the last available dime out of Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-works as Cruella. With everything she had to put up with in this movie - the Lame script, the endless makeup, behind a cake at the end - I hope they gave her an extremely large pay slip. <br /> <br /> (Talking about where in the world you should find a fur factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant, all located in the same building - as you do in the climax of this movie? ) Of course, the real stars of the movie should be the dogs. They serve as "Macaulay Culkin's" in this movie that pulls all the stupid "Home Alone" gags on the bad guys. (Biting them in the crotch, running over their hands with trolleys, spraying them with glaze, etc. Etc., Ad nauseum.) I have to admit, the dogs were pretty good actors - much better than the people. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is wasted in this movie as a French French furrier. The two human "dog lovers" - rehashed from the previous movie but with different actors - are quite boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the film cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home and watches the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner scene. I thought to myself, "Oh, don't take it!" I expected half the people to make a satire on the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - made "spaghetti strands kiss" and shot the meatball with her nose, etc. /> <br /> And don't let me start with the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the film * are * good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest of it is unbearable drink.
