As a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place, but goes up with a poor performance. Stephen Carpenter's written / instructing efforts freely borrow from other better movies, such as Jacobs Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give up the premise; Suffice it to say that it is not as well handled here as in the two superior films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller stars like Cassie, going to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends and Annabel (acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers (?) In transparent masks. She survives the wreck, but when you go to college, the sight of the hospital's trial and the dead are again and disappear and left her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? Who lives? What is genuine? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors have the look of a badly-done, gore-filled, blood-stained, body-punched teen-exploitation flick. It is true that it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes (abundant, repetitive and mind-numbing), but at least it tries to create excitement through ideas rather than clich√©s, unfortunately, quite successfully. It disturbs confusion much more often than cohesion, as history becomes jumbled, cluttered and incoherent near key points in the mystery (predictable as it is.) <br /> <br /> Horror fans downloading a copy have no idea They are in a movie that is more concerned about building a troubled facade of reality than delivering a body count. Credit goes to Carpenter to try to create something beyond a derived teenage horror flick; Too bad has he created a derived psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves kudos to show strength in the central achievement, actually develops his character and evokes a feeling of emotion as the dissolved Cassie. It's great filmmakers are trying something else, but the movie ends in a mixed bag and erroneous experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
