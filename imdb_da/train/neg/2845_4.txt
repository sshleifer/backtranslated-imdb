This movie switches from the 4th to the 1st without bothering with the 3rd or 2nd cutter until the sappy, b-film finish line. The wife in the beginning is easily the best and brightest part of the movie. It's worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you can miss it. Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad to mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the signs of this supposed fringe community turn out to be sacred - especially the incredible character Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
