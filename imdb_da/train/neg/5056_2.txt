*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - Cynthia Rothrock's and Richard Norton's acting acting. The rest of the play is terrible (this is not supported by the scary script). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, the leader of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed my head as he expressed his "rage" over having lost a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better and his "it's a hostile takeover" line (that's the rest of the title of this movie) was delivered as badly as you could. There are no other protagonists, but no other actor / actress distinguished him / her in this movie. We now come to the plot. This should tell you everything you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor" was Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, an inner city teacher. Now she is a C.I.A. agent (or was it any other state body - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I didn't even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. the application process was like. Interviewer: What previous work experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you are hired! I only give it a "2" because of some decent play and a good plot twist at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain will be caught).
