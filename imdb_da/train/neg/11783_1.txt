What a crazy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. No-talent-what-so-ever-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there ever a script for this fat movie, or did the director just accidentally hit the capture button on the camera and then decided to record the movie when they joined together? Is it supposed to be a children's movie or a comedy or what? My friend's younger brother is in the 6th grade, and he and his classmates just made an amateur movie for their school project, which made this geeky movie. This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life! There is just no excuse for this flick!
