Anyone who is familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database knows that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time. There are many movies I do not like, which for some inevitable reason have felt the urge to review. But if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, this title takes on all-time no. 1 horrible movie. I can't believe I actually made it from the start of this clunker to goal! It is clearly meant to catch the taste of Mel Brooks Young Frankenstein, but where that movie was a fun tag On horror movie traditions, this is a desperately strained and rude attempt to twist the laughs of embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr. are ashamed to be here as a few journalists in today's Transylvania (maybe they realized early on that they were convicted in this dud). During their research, they come across all the top monsters from past horror favorites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is able to brave this movie right up to the end can ask for an effort to be driven through their hearts to relieve them of the pain of boredom. It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and shows that when comedy fails in a big way, it results in awesomely dire entertainment.
