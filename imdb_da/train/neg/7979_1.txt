This movie was slow but boring, and the play often drifted into the ham area. Redgrave's character was unappealing as the 60 something woman is trying to compete with Thurman's 20 something for the love of Fox's character (why is beyond me). The title of the film should have been "Shall people on the lake". The actors played as if they were in an exercise. A terribly predictable ending to start. I can't believe this is on this site as a comedy!
