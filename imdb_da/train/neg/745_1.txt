I'm not quite sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad movies, as they are often the most entertaining ones. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and spooky direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I expected), this film had all those qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were incredibly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to look for include Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, some scenes of the strangers are well done. <br /> <br /> The play was as bad as it could have been, as it had been based directly on H.G. Wells' book. To have such good source material, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so over-top to make fun. And then there is overgrown ... the most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen for a long time. Of course, only half of the movie contains plays. The rest are signs that go around aimlessly and poorly reproduced effects. <br /> <br /> Saying that Timothy Hines is an incomplete instructor would be an injustice for inappropriate directors. Using various colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even within scenes, the poor green screen, is amazing to me how this man ever got approval to lead a movie. I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to put a brilliant book into this bad movie. Bravo, Mr Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone planning to watch this movie is to do what I did: Have some friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while you watch it, drink and maybe You will do it all the way through. It makes an excellent bad movie, so fun and laugh yourself at this disaster.
