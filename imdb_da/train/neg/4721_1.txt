Before watching this movie, check out the reviews available on the Internet about the film's fake of events, especially its cries about the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were ripped off by Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentaries also belong to various pro-American American organizations. Please review this movie critically and read reviews in advance. Most reviews claim that the documentaries take their arguments too far, even though he raises questions that address the conventional wisdom of war. A review in the NYTimes by Stephen Holden says it would be "inaccurate to label this documentary pro-Serbian", but one should ask both the presentation of the facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources and the omission of the facts. who encourage Serbian forces. I do not advise seeing this documentary, but I warn you to investigate it with a particularly critical eye (which one should do anyway).
