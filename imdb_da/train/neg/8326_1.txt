This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> Plot (how small is there): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart, desperately needs a transplant. Clay has been secretly engaged to her mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. At night, when these two are secretly married, there is only one heart donor with the same rare blood type. Go find the odds for one! Once on the operating table, Clay finds the anesthesia not working and he can feel everything and hear everything. Luckily, Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor-sharp scalpel. Open the chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha, which we are told he is doing through an annoying voice-over that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you did not blow up laughter yet, surely you will begin to see the surgical scenes. How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by a surgeon, a nurse, a treating doctor, and a drunk anesthetist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom was pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior that is too preposterous to be taken seriously ... the operating room is not even kept sterile ... people are practically only able to go in and out of the room without even washing up .. During the operation, the viewer gets to hear Clay's thoughts, none of which is too fascinating. Ah ... but here's what it is about ... the doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. To believe in him being unconscious, the villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from anyone in the hospital while an incomplete doctor who has four malpractice measures runs against him, performs major cardiac surgery. Not even Clay's over-protecting mother seems to be able to control her status. The only one interested in keeping up to date is Samantha ... but oh no ... could sweet Sam be in it .... You'll quickly find out through a Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> < In the end, it wouldn't even matter if Clay had undergone anesthesia awareness because the end would have been the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of the patients who were the victims of anesthesia anesthesia, maybe something silly fun to have ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
