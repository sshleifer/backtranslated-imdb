Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-standing anthropologist (Richard Harris, in the worst role in a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying something or something. She tracks him down (how?) And he tells her about the native stories of a giant monster whose nocturnal howling can be heard throughout the jungle. Turns out to be Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the movie's best dialogue) who saves her from evil and falls in love with her and leaves them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to haul naked while a Horny Monkey looks on and toast. Usually, I am very open to different opinions about movies, but that is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unendurable", which is the best one-word summary I can think of. The Maltin Movie Guide notes that they should almost think of a lower rating than BOMB.)
