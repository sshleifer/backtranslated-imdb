I'm an 11th degree at my high school. In my current world class class, a kid in my class had this video and suggested we see. So we did. I firmly believe that we went to the moon because my father is working for NASA. Although I think this movie is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all, did he have to show JFK to be shot? And how dare he use all the biblical quotes. The only good thing about this movie is the sparking debates, which is good b / c in my class, we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next movie could be called "A Funny Thing Happened on September 11th" or "A Funny Thing Happened to the White House".
