It is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever wasted money on! The reason is, erm sorry, I said there was a plot? The scary moment was when ... I can't think of one! The best special effect that made me hide under the bed covers was ... you can't even think about that. You knew who the killer was from the start. There was nothing scary about the whole movie. In fact, they were only two vaguely interesting bits when you saw the child's sister Misty in the shower and when you saw that the nurse Toppan took her out. This movie should only be seen to get an idea of ​​how NOT to make a horror movie !!!
