The apparent attack on Microsoft made by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property rights or market economies in general. <br /> <br /> Loony Liberal Tim Robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill-gates and is a cartoon-like corporate villain who orders murder right and left. <br /> <br /> Although Microsoft may participate in some anti-competitive activities at times, they are unlikely to actually kill people. Therefore, the film is over the top and ridiculous from the start. The "deeper" point is apparently that major technological innovations must be free from the public and not subject to intellectual property law. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if they are not to market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property rights. It is one thing to be against anti-competitive behavior - - That's common sense. It is completely different to being against market competition in the first place, which is what the film's mantra ("knowledge belongs to humanity") represents. <br /> <br /> Another example of Hollywood being totally out of touch with reality.
