I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf in a Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to see it; however, do not expect much. As the beginning credits roll around I am surprised to discover this movie was made under the Filmirage company. Filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword" so I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, it had the potential to be quite decent, even if it was unoriginal. Gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while in the film, the pace began to pull and I thought to myself, "Okay, you better get killed soon" or "Someone better mutate". At the beginning of this move, when I had these thoughts, although someone might have been killed or mutated, it was as I said noted that gore and effects were not very good. What made matters worse was that scene transitions were confusing; example: first dr. houseman would be at the zoo so he would catch a glimpse of possibly killing someone, finally he would wake up in a cold sweat in bed - get the audience asking "was he dreaming he was with the zoo?". As the film's pace, these scene transitions gradually became worse. <br /> <br /> I could try to say that Dr. Houseman's character development was pretty good, but at the end of the movie, that's when you 'I've seen what the doctor has metamorphosed in, hopefully you'll laugh - which is really the only reason to watch this movie at least once; This movie accidentally runs like a long-winded joke. The costume for Um, what Doctor Houseman gets, can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword", which was made in the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they always reuse the same stuff!
