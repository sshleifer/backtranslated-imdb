When I go to watch movies, I will stop and watch it, or if I didn't like it, I would go to sleep, but it was pure crap, I actually went up and went out! .... It was bad manuscript and put together I hated it. Nor should they have taken Brendan Frasier away, he was much better. It was not as good as I expected, considering that I really liked the George of The Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, such as the bird, and when he came down in a tree. I hope the director for this will take into account, and the next film he makes, he must rethink ... horrible! I really want to give Ursla a well done job when she made the movie worthy (until I went out) ... overall I give this movie a 2 out of 10
