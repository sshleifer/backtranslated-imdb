Completely invisible. "Twists" are all quite predictable, if you have seen any movies in the last ten years, and the few interesting parts (where someone uses context angles to make a decision) are few and are missing a lot, since the "secret" is already been shown before these tracks are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) The action is decent enough. The story is simply not very interesting. The whole "still awake" premise is lifted by the astral projection issues (not fun ) <br /> <br /> The operating scene was initially tense, a bit uncomfortable, but then it became quite banal, not horrible, but not memorable, Terrence Howard's least interesting role to date, as far as I have seen. <br /> <br /> Kind of boring, overall.
