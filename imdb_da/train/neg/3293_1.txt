What a nice thing. <br /> <br /> Of all the nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to restore and update, this is by far the most meaningless. This was a completely pointless show at first, and we really don't need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> Never mind bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so many advances have been made socially since the show showed that the whole show's points (if ever one) were lost. <br /> <br /> What is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he is NOT overweight?
