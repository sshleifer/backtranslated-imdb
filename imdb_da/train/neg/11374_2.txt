I couldn't relate to this movie. Failed to engage me intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very close and engaging. I couldn't connect with and thus worry about any of the characters, and I find it hard to find much that is positive to say about it. <br /> <br /> I have read it to understand it properly, you need to be aware of some of the more unclear aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that, as an atheist, I am probably not familiar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films dealing with religious problems that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and do not rely on specialist knowledge or beliefs.
