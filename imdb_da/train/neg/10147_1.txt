I don't usually comment on anything (I read the other opinions) ... but this, I _have to comment ... I was convinced to see this movie of worlds as action, F-117 and other high-tech stuff but with only a few first minutes, and I changed ... Lousy play, miserable script and a great science fiction. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> Just ... don't interfere ... <br /> <br /> And another thing before any movie controls I usually use comments and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try, now I wonder who judges this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??????? ???
