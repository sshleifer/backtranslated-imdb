Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne "got the biggest train set in the world" to play with, but unfortunately lacked the ability to do something more than watch his train set become a train wreck still talked about with shock and a strange kind awe. Despite postmodern interpretations that somehow claim to see it as homosexual or even feminist, the case is actually a disaster in 1970 and is still one day. Where anyone who has got the funds for Mr Sarnes available could have turned up so royally remains a carefully guarded secret. Only Michael Cimino ever came close to the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes "Heaven's Gate". But movies seemed to be egotours to their respective directors, but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great films from the 1970s before wasting the greatness of the studio, while Mr Sarne only had the rather celebrated "Joanna" in his closet. In addition, "Heaven's Gate" boasted some memorable and well-managed sets where tragic "Myra Breckinridges closet was bar. Simply put, it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in Hollywood's history.
