WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this movie from one of my friends who bought it at 1.98 at Walmart and he felt he was taken! It's over boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the play is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a script. The Martians are CGI, which looks like they were made by a beginner or a fan-produced movie. I can't stress how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenes, the martyrs torture a local female prisoner. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is quite noticeable, and when she is killed, you can see that it is a computer scale that resembles something from a game back in 1990! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie as a plague! You can download two trailers from their site and see how god it is!
