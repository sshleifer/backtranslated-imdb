For this album, this film is exciting, but it is hardly original. Back in 1998, a movie starring Talia Shire was called The Landlady almost exactly the same plot, but with younger characters. The story is Amanda Lear has had a bad life, violent father, horny doctor, mental home, etc. She is finally released from the happy home under the direction of her perverted doctor ... who she anal abused and kills the poor guy. (Now it was original) The doctor had financed a mansion for her before killing him and buried sucker in the backyard. After moving in, she falls in love with a stud named Richard, who is just married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Hostess you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone coming between her and Richard (including a roadie). Many of the idea has come from the previous movie, the same idiot sidekick, sticking his nose in, the same spy on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, same as a bodypress. It had some original materials, beer bottle stuff was brutal. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful tits in the hot-top stage. Something of a ripoff but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
