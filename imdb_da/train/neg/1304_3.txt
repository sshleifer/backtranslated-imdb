Very low-budget police procedural film on violence detectives is attempting to solve the murder of a woman whose body arises in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only link is a tattoo on the arm. Although it was published by RKO, it appears to be an independent production that was taken up by the studio for distribution. Cast and crew with a few exceptions - among them a young and unredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - consist of complete unknowns and it shows. The performances are universal sub-pairs and would not pass patterns in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry at all between the leading players. But despite the many shortcomings of the film, it has some good points. The New York City investment footage and the film's ultra-low budget give it a grin of authenticity, as the far better "The Naked City", a firearm in a dark basement handles and some of the investigation procedures are clever. Otherwise it is not much to write home about. However, it is worth a look to look at the seamic parts of New York City in the early 1950s, and old car buffers will be ecstatic to see the legions of the 30s and 40s in the streets. <Br /> <br />.
