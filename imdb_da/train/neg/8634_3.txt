Seeing a picture of a man attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could be up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, there is nothing but a rotten body's close-ups that are a little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter's attempt to find out who killed him. None of the characters are appealing, and since you find out how they did it (the twist was generally cool), you stop taking care. The only good thing I can say is that it was more reasonable than Nightmare Concert!
