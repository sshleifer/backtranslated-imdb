I rented I CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was first seized by US Customs if it ever tried to get into this country and therefore a fan of movies is considered "controversial". I really had to see it for myself. <br /> <br /> The reason is centered on a young Swedish drama student named Lena, who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular, she will focus her attention on making a kind of documentary about what the average Swede was thinking about certain political issues such as Vietnam war and race problems in the United States. In between, politicians and ordinary citizens in Stockholm ask about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates and married men. What kills me if I am KURIOUS-GUL is 40 years ago this was considered pornographic. Really sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot as something cheaply made porn. While my compatriots feel shocking, sex and nudity are really a big book in Swedish movies. Even Ingmar Bergman, probably their answer to the good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his film. <br /> <br /> I recommend the filmmakers for the fact that any gender shown in the movie is shown for artistic purposes rather than just shocking people and making money to appear in pornographic theaters in America. I am CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish films. But really, this movie doesn't have much of a plot.
