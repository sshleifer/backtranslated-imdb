Don't let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this is not it. Normally I would go too stupid if it was fun, but this stupid was so stupid that it almost (or possibly) made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The movie quality is better than a handheld but not much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These issues should never really be discouraged from watching a horror movie, but add this amazing (cry) cast and you have a really good mood. The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his family cabin in Texas this weekend. He also extends the invitation to his lady, who is in love with her office. On the way they meet a woman in need, who is then invited to join the other girls. <br /> <br /> Staying at the cottage includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when a girl disappears and odd things are facing the house. <br /> <br /> From here (the audience) and the moron, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon start to distrust each other. All in all, I think I've done better than it is. The main battle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot is constructed, it is badly acting and the motivations are clueless. Once again it could be forgiven, it was fun, but unfortunately it is not. Twist ending is just a twist because no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it wouldn't have made any sense at least. Don't let this review stop you from seeing the shadow study of this movie. (Woah, my nose grew only eight inches.)
