Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book "McCabe" was overlooked at the time of its release, but in recent years has achieved a sterling critical successor. Apart from a very convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the image looks (deliberately) broke and unpleasant. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a century of entrepreneur residing in battling societies on the outskirts of nowhere and helping to organize the first brothel; Of course, when profits start to come in, Beatty is threatened by the city's hesitators who want some of the action. Altman creates a solemn, winter-like atmosphere for the film, giving the audience some sense of time and place, but the action of this enchanting little town is limited - most of the story is vignettes - and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There is hardly a statement (just the opposite) in fact and the insidious actors are staring at each other without much on their minds. It is a self-covering image, and yet, in Altman-quirky way, it bears defeat proudly. ** from ****
