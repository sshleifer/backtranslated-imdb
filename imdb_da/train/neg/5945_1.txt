A black guy fighting ..... and probably winning .... yes ... 1/10. Of course, fiction. <br /> <br /> So we are presented with a dusty title, a really nice roof line and even a nice line .. It's about it, that's where it ends .. We move into fiction after that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, then the black guy doesn't get confused with the name .. depicts a black guy .. Umm, that's all there is to the name .. <br /> <It's so hard to find decent help, must have hired the black boys friends to bring the low budget, low ineptness of this movie, have the camera's shadow behind the first scenes .... yes obviously idiot moment for the average guy like you and me .. but yes ... 10 lines. review submitted. If you paid to watch this movie, you were screwed.
