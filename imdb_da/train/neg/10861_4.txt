Maybe I'm missing something because I've read more positive things about The Man Who Cheated Though I Have Read Bad Reviews - and I just don't understand. I like my noirs to have a small style for those with characters who speak, see and work like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have the style or presence or what you want to call it. Take the main actor, Lee J. Cobb. His room-like, unrolled look is about as far from the dashing, smooth-talking noir archetype as you find. Or take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen for a while. She's just not convincing in the role. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it is tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new to the genre. I could have predicted the result of The Man Who Cheated Himself after about five minutes. And the last cat-and-mouse hunting scene is plain old boring. Ten to fifteen minutes nothing happens really ruined any pacing, the movie might have had it.
