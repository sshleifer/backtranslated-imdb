From the capital of nepotism, another junk girl comes in a fancy wrapper. "CQ" tells a boring, heterogeneous mess of a story that's a little more than a bunch of stupid caricatures, a treasure and straight man Davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick. I can't think of any reason, someone wants to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making. (D)
