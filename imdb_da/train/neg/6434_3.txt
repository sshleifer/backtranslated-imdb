I am always surprised at how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata wouldn't be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First of all, the sound. Manufacturers spent more time on the audio track than editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack played and no one spoke, and when Patrica spoke in her monotonous voice, she could hardly hear. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica basically had 3 feelings. Quiet, in great pain, or really sour, she has stigmata. The first was the dominant, the other screaming pain involved, the third involved raising his voice. It was the volume that removed the three and not the emotions. Perhaps I missed much of the deep meaning and subplotter that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the horrible shooting and MTV style. When you watch a 3 minute video, you need quick cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2 hour feature film it is nauseating. I fail to see the importance of her seeing that women are cross-stalks and lose a child. And no Pittsburg is raining so often! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story, with something to say could have been calculated, but all the budget was used to buy music and equipped to make slow rain drop shots and hire the gorgous apartment that wife Arquett lived in that they ended up being the guy with the story.
