This is the most clich√© and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is cringe worthy, and the two main players - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very stupid and naive and should never have listened to Danny's false promises. Neve Campbell and the murderer of Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this bad attempt at a movie. Danny (Dean Paras) looks at his late thirties and the girl he's trying to sleep - Corey looks like she's still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; There is nothing smooth about this movie at all. 1/10 Avoid
