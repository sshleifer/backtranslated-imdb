I'm probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work I couldn't wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie I was totally disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main purpose is to survive. But he is not in an arena. He is loose in the city and has to escape the game show (I suppose you would call them) villians who have no resemblance to the movie characters. This premise built a lot of excitement and suspension and ended much with climax. The movie was absolutely garbage. There was no cinematic quality to it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he failed with this.
