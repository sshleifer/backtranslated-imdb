I can't believe I wasted five hours in my life on this nonsense. The previous five-day offer from this author was very enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the biggest culprit since she either muttered or gobbled her lines, but most of the other voices followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, ancient stagers whose diction was exemplary. Don't listen to producers before they are broadcast to ensure that the dialogue is audible? As a result, I suppose I wasted what was going on, and when the original plot line seemed to metamorphists into the standard-them-and-us case between Muslims and the rest, I soon lost interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. A complete dud.
