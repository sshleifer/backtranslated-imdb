Richard Dix is ​​a large, not very nice industry stand that has almost worked its way to death. If he takes the vacation, his doctors propose to him, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, he'll probably be better off if he ignores WHISTLER's VOICE. <br /> <br /> This William Castle-oriented entrance has some great moments (the introduction and depiction of Richard Dix's life through the Citizen Kane newsletter), and some exciting plotting in the last wheels. Dix's performance is generally quite good. But unfortunately, it just doesn't quite work because you don't end up buying the characters would behave as they do. Also, the movie jumps from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30's movie as a midsection (full of beautiful urban ethnic types who don't mind that they are not rich) and back to a complex noir plot for last 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> This is a decent movie - worth seeing - but it needed a little more time to set up a few characters and a female leader to meet the demands of her role.
