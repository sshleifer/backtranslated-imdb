"Phantasm" from 1979 was a very atmospheric, eerie, scary and very original Horror flick and in one word cool. The first successor in 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and very entertaining. After the first successor, "Phantasm" creator Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord of the Lord" from 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is even quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new are sometimes tiring, making it quite disappointing in relationship with its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> In the beginning, we introduce the secret of the mysterious sentinel spheres (the brain's sucking flying silver balls) are unraveled. Then, a series of unnecessary and annoying new characters (eg Tim, a "Home Alone" style little child who is great at shooting, a Rocky, a hard and super-chilled nunchaku-swinging black chick with a crew bracket) is introduced . The movie also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed guitar player Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still pretty scary as the big man, but the fact that the long man speaks much more in this movie makes him lose some of his creepy. The character of Mike is played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he had been replaced by James LeGros in part 2), which in my opinion does not make much difference. Gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but it is still a disappointment, especially because the attempt to make up for the lack of ideas becomes annoying quite quickly. <br /> <br /> All things considered, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable time waster, but it is certainly disappointing with its predecessors. Fans of the first two "Phantasm" films can give it a try, but I do not recommend setting your expectations too high.
