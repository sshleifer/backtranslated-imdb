I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but I think about it that way, because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the original buzz was positive enough that my boyfriend insisted that we watch it, and we actually LIVE IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember where the audience began to sneak at a certain time and basically laughed the movie the rest of the way through. When we reached the infamous (and interminable) snake battle scene, I think everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can admit is the lush location shoot. Oh, and there are also Bo's breasts, though her plays are so wood that nudity is untruthful and doesn't rate much more than a Playboy figurative. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic excitement" of this movie is between Bo's horrible acting and her husband's horrible direction. The snake battle must be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever filmed. But this is one of the movies that is bad enough, it may be worth looking at the level of accidental humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid to watch.
