They really can't get stupid than this movie, which deals with 3 losers, trying to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities on many of our higher learning schools. The problem is that these losers are trying to do this 15 years after their university year, when one has been assigned to look over the daughter of a female senator who is being used as vice-president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she gets out of it all. The girls go through drunk breeds, exotic dance and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It can't really be much worse than this horrible movie.
