... in an otherwise horrible, erroneous, would be Oedipal comedy. <br /> <br /> I was the lonely victim of a 7:20 screen tonight (3 days after the movie was opened), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that movie guests were following warnings. <br /> <br /> The flower is from Jon Heder's rose. The new double chin is not his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad gem simply doesn't work. It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen. Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few have seen her in this, the very best vehicle she's been chosen for the last couple of weeks. <br /> <br /> Sitting alone in the theater tonight I became alive (laughing) when Daniels got the breadth to deliver the only three-dimensional character of the movie. He is really among our very best actors. <br /> <br /> In summary, even Jeff Daniel's work cannot solve this image.
