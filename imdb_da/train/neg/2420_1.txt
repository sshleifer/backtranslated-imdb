I usually only comment on movies that I like to find "everyone to their own taste", but here I will make an exception. The premise of this movie, which somehow seems to be lost in shuffle, is that these two self-centered adults have a perfect right to go out to Las Vegas, become full, get married, and inflict erratic suffering on their respective flesh of children. Even to allow for the culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have neither the courage nor the responsibility to wake up the next morning and regret what they have set in motion. After all, "love" is all that important, isn't it? To hell with everyone else. Whether things are "ultimately drawn" is not really the meaning; In fact, it is quite irrelevant. The point is that disrespectful to others, especially if they are young, and especially if they are in a state of addiction, it becomes the light of and thus strengthened by this film. There are far more innocent behaviors that these "parents" could have done that would have brought an army of social workers upside down in a heartbeat.
