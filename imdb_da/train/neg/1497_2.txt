Understand, I'm reviewing the movie I've seen. I realize pretty much all nudity and gore was cut from this movie and thus completely neutralizes it. When I saw names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached, I knew I wouldn't get a horror classic, but at least I expected free boobies and bloodshed. But no, it must be the most slaughtered modern horror movie, I think it's easy to tell, there's a lot more to specific scenes, but they are suddenly cut off, or the scene ends just right as it begins. How do you turn up cannibals and pornstars? I think it's a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director slept with an executive's wife or something because it's literally amazing how much was cut off this. Reading about it a few years back in Fangoria, I was thrilled, it looked like a funny movie, but unfortunately the true movie is locked in a vault somewhere, and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled Evil Breed. Hopefully, an unwarranted rock will be released one day as I think there is a good movie in this mess, but until then, take a twelve packet of bids because it's the only way you get it through this movie.
