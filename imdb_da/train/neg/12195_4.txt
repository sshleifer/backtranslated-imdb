The reason is not so original. If anyone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome, who lives everyday, is boring and fake, and everyone asks others what they think about them. Really boring after half an hour, because it is easy to understand where the story is to complete. This is because it is easy to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie, so even the hardest parts seem normal. To sum up in the first 2 minutes of the movie would be enough, and the purpose of the movie was already said. The family looked from a 30-year-old, I don't like watching movies that will show reality, but to be coherent with his thoughts, you have to push more than the normal situations. Really good, how Muccino puts the camera in the right place that moves with carathers, and that's the only reason I'm not sleeping in the cinema, but always in the movie screaming from the beginning. Perhaps it may be good to see the family, how they are in reality and not blame it for anything. Morante was intense and big as usual but unfortunately on a bad movie!
