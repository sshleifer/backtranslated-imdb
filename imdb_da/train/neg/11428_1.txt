OH MY GOD .. THE WORST SH * I have ever seen - this is the main thinking that came into my mind right after watching the movie. And I really don't understand anyone with opposite myths. Although the idea might be good, but the effect was miserable. I especially believe H. Graham's role. What was it??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was played in an affected and annoying way. Every time she looks, it reminds you to watch a movie and destroy a spirit at the moment, so the whole movie, because the most time you can see there is her stupid faces with stupid attempts to create emotions. AMAZING, don't play your time.
