Okay, I saw the sneak preview of this silly movie. First, the film is so exposed and not really, they are all acting. They can't sing. They are all too full of themselves. It's terrible. Yes children 8 to 10 can enjoy, but it's really stupid. I think they say their leader is a child. And there's the record company fake. Its stupid. Don't see it. <br /> <br /> As for the setup and control, not so bad. It's a cute documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> See this only if you don't really like good music. It is also very corny. It is not even tasteful. I hate being so strange ... but it's really a piece of junk.
