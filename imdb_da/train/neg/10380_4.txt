I don't think anyone is sitting down to watch this movie, expecting something distant as a classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you were ever scared. This doesn't really work at that level, but the cast tries hard, and the movie doesn't cut one of the happy endings. History is about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and he brings his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the US Consulate, helps them find a house to live in, and he finds one who is haunted. About 140 years earlier in the same house, a samurai found his wife cheating on him and killing them both and committing suicide. Their ghosts still reside in the house, and when Fletcher arrives, it doesn't take long before strange things start to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the ghosts occupy the bodies of Fletcher and they begin to function as the Japanese people that they were before, and Laura starts flirting with Alex, leading to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave more strictly, and after he has poured soup into Amy's neck, he goes and asks a monk for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts make Ted, Laura and Alex play their death scene as it did 140 years earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Kevin Connor, well known as a good television director, but he has made horror and science fiction movies before and has worked with McClure on some of them. While this never comes close to being frightening or evolving, it has two things in it that I liked. First, it doesn't have one of the juicy conclusions where the couple embraces after knocking down the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody battle, where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghost. Second, it has Susan George in the cast! I have always been a fan of her, even though she has performed mostly schlock, but her performances are always top notch. She, too, usually seems naked, as she does here in two separate scenes, and while she does not have classic features, she has a unique tomboy who looks at her, and that is one of the reasons she was so popular. But after getting into silly movies like this, I think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and looks at the ghosts screaming when the monk gives an exorcism, is practically worth a giggle or two. The reason is that it's stupid, and I hope George decides to resume his career.
