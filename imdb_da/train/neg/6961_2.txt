I totally agree with the second comment that someone should do a What is tigerlily with this movie. It must be one of the worst French movies I've seen for a long time (actually with Brotherwood of the wolves, 2 horrible movies in an overly short period). It is really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea is fun. In particular, Antoine DeCaunes and Jean Rochefort were among my darlings, I was bitterly disappointed to see them compromising on such a bad movie. Lou Doyon is pretty bad as usual, showing that a beautiful face and famous parents can get you into the cinema, but they don't necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you want to laugh watching a Alain Chabat instead or a good piece of fun like LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
