I couldn't bear to sit through the whole movie. Do families like this really feel like a place? There have been many comments describing this family as related to LLBean models and such, and I think it is a good description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> More absurdly amazing writing / acting occurs when we meet a character referred to in High School as "pigface", which of course has grown into a drop-dead beautiful 20-year-old Harvard-trained plastic surgeon (but only to do it well in the world - not for the money) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I stopped watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then you might enjoy this sentimental, self-abandoned waste of time.
