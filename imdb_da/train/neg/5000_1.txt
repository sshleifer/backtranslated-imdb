This is probably the worst excuse for TV shows since, oh, I don't know, what is happening now? Nothing ever happened on this ridiculous "series". Although it's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin himself, you don't get any good details in their personal lives. It is mostly just those who do stupid, jokey little talk and act as white waste. See, I love Britney's music as much as the next child, but this show is just plain filler for a nation so dependent on Britney that they would see her clip her toenails (yes, it could be a real episode). Thank goodness, these two broke up because they were falsified together. This show is TOXIC!
