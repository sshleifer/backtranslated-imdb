Fox's "The True Story Of Jesse James" (1957) is a remarkably bad widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the error is, but the casting in this version of the two key characters, the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham-fisted manuscript, must surely have something to do with it. <br /> <br /> At the end of the thirties and eighties, Tyrone Power Fox's supreme leader was, but in the 1950s his star began to decline, and studio head Darryl Zanuck began to marry novice Robert Wagner to take his seat. This was a big mistake on Zanuck's part, as Wagner turned out to be a less than adequate replacement. With the possible exceptions from "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956), it is difficult to think of Wagner to distinguish itself in anything! Also Jeffrey Hunter was no more than a Fox contract player before being awarded Frank James to Wagner's Jesse in "The True Story Of Jesse James". The loan from the studio the previous year was this actor's one hallmark of the outstanding and revealing performance of John Ford's classic "The Searchers". But his game here with Wagner as the second half of James Brothers is nothing short of boring. No player brings any personality or color to their respective roles. They miss the brand, lacking charisma and appeal, so vividly exhibited by Power and Fonda in the original. The movie is also horrified by too many flashbacks, and with the everywhere manuscript Wagner, like Robin Hood in the American West, crosses like a charmless introvert twit that you can't feel any empathy for at all. The support material is hardly worth mentioning, but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead hardly looks in like Ma James. The best aspects of this involved western are the wonderful Cinemascope / Color cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent music score of the underrated and well-known composer Leigh Harline!
