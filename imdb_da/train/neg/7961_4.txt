Five years after the original Creepshow is another subterranean horror sentence written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time, there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories are either original or prominent. The first story is a scary staple, a formal story of a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge on the murderers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it's just for sure to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the older shop owners. The second story, "The Raft", is a Stephen King story. It's about four teenagers who unknowingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon, the children are screaming for their life as a watery lump, making each of them without apparent reason. However, the kids are instead of exciting saddled with poor dialogue and dopey-headed behavior, which prevents us from worrying about what happens next time. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker" which is actually a retread adapted to Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir thrill movie. Then it was adapted to a famous Twilight Zone episode with Inger Stevens. "Hitch hiker" works best out of these three offers, but it is not without problems either. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse who ends up running over a hitch hiker, or she thinks. But we do not know if we should sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist only to tell the stories with their phrases. The wreck story with the bullies seems a little out of place. Tom Savini appears as "creep" in this installment. The good thing is that there have been no more successors. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
