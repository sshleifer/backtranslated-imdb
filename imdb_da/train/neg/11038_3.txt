I always wrote this series out as a complete stink party because Jim Belushi was involved in it and heavily. But one day a tragic accident arose. After a White Sox game, I concluded that the remote was completely on the other side of the room in some way. Now I just got up and went over the room to get the remote control, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then why not just get up and go across the country to watch TV in another state? "Nuts to it," I said. So I decided to just hang on the couch and take what fate had in store for me. What fate had been stored was an episode of this show, an episode that I remember very little, except that I had once again made a very broad, general sweeping condemnation based on zero objective or experience evidence, with nothing at all to back my opinions up with, and once again I was just right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comic delivery of a hair lighthouse. The women are physically attractive, but also Stepford's to evoke any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no need to stop yourself from running down to the local television station with a can of petrol and a flamethrower and sending each copy of this snippet back to hell. <br /> <br /> Apart from the wonderful comics by Larry Joe Campbell, America's Biggest Cartoon Character. This guy plays Belushi brother-in-law Andy, and he's gold. How good is he really? Well, apart from being fun, his job is to make Belushi look good. It's like trying to make butt warts look good. But Campbell pulls it in style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe, this performance would consist of a little idle appearance, Courtney Thorne-Smith slipping Belushi over his head with a frying pan while alternately beating his chest and playing with the straw on the cage floor. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell appointed Comedic Bacon because he enhances the taste of everything he is in!
