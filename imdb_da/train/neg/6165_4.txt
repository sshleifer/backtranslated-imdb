Allen goes to the country (a place he hates to go in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual successful white middle-class bellyaching types found in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to entertain in Woody Allen's comedies, but here he really falls flat on his face. Even the one-liners seem to have left him. It's really no plot (bar and pieces of cod Shakespeare) - but Allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air, which just makes the case even more turbid and half-baked. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work on any level and is just a huge bore. The best thing about this movie (apart from the final credits coming up) is that the bad reviews seem to make him wake up and realize that just throwing a slapdash script together and casting your friends into it That doesn't make it entertainment.
