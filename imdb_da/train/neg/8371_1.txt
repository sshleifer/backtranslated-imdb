I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew from another one that this would be a piece of ****, and it would be best to avoid it, but I somehow pulled into seeing this by some friends, i went into the cinema with low expectations, but i hoped there would be a few cheap laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this movie bring a curl to the face, they mostly consist of people who take hits in the face and the balls, the child looks strange and seems like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in Today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and highly stereotyped. I will never have to watch this **** movie again, I'd rather take a ball to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. If anyone I see says they like it, I will physically hit them in the face
