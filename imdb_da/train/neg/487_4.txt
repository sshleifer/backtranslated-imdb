What did the instructor think? Anyone who has read the biography of Artemisia is still impressed by her reluctance to public rape in the Renaissance era and even suffers from torture to show that Tassi was guilty. This fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most horrible hour she is facing her MAN. Why should movies depicting the Renaissance be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the lively side of life or have Hollywood happily won? While I would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie, I cannot make sense of turning Artimia's life story upside down. Very disappointing choice of makers in this movie.
