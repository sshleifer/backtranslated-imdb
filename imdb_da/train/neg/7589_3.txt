What do you expect when there is no script to begin with, and therefore nothing that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are great actors, they just have nothing to say or something to react to. Even the earthquake was rather poor. And I don't know how close the film follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl coming out of nothing, so it turns out only that Arturo has a nice warm heart, but some stereotypes don't matter. And he even buries Camilla into the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a good Catholic funeral where at least he could bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the L.A. statement was ridiculously graphically created. Something good? The window to his apartment felt right, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since Body Snatchers or Night of Living Dead, whichever it was.
