Where to start? . . . I feel ... offended! That's right, offended! I've just spent 1.5hrs of my life, 1.5hrs, which I could have used doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so-called horror flick. It's not scary, it's not fun, its not dramatic, it's no action, it's nothing ... It's predictable, its boring, its tragic ... I can get a little hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, do not see it ... unless you will also feel offended.
