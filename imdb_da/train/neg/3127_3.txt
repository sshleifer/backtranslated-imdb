An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbled upon an unfortunate, 40 foot mummy, well-preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this a secret and call a Jewish translator to help find out the history of history. The mummy, as explained in the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants who apparently existed in "these days". To save his son from a devastating flood predicted to kill everything, he mummies his son and bury him with more servants for centuries - planning to wake him years from then. In our present day, fallen angels are still on the earth, and the mummy arises and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the movie is slow, dealing with a lot of biblical crap and a couple of miserable, air-punching battles. The mummy is decent in appearance but does not appear nearly enough. It should have had more to do with it, but it looked a lot so ... eh. Do not want to.
