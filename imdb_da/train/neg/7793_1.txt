This really is one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a giant zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad actors, lame "special effects" a stupid story and anything you might encounter in second-rate movies as long as the movie has a good atmosphere / history / suspension or whatever preferably to offer. This has virtually no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate, perhaps worse. Some friends of mine and I made a small movie during a week's holiday and did absolutely a better job (no zombie film itself). <br /> <br /> This flick is not even fun, not something else. Really bad and superfluous special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except a white extra skin pulled over their faces), WAY TO VERY FALSE BLOOD (I like realism, the combination of realism and zombie film is debatable but the presented gore is simply stupid). The camera stays quite long with feeding scenes, it gets boring, and you can't do without, but wonder why the zombies are using WEAPONS (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the details of dubbing (others have done so). Although I myself am from Germany and at least curious about the original version, I will not waste more of my time with this movie. Stay away from it as far as you can.
