This movie is absolutely horrible, but it can be fun at times, although this humor is completely unintentional. The plot was beyond ridiculous. I don't even think a 2-year-old would be convinced by the ridiculous idioci that the filmmakers were trying to merge into a story. But on the positive side, some of the horrific sudden turns give a great sense of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a huge missile hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I save you. <br /> <br /> The action is generally ridiculous. Most of children's roles are kind of cute, but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful everywhere. The adults do not take their roles seriously at all, but that is pretty much a good thing. If they had tried to be credible, the movie would have been even worse. It's hard to imagine. When you get past the movie's overall crappiness, there are actually a couple of standout moments of almost non-crappiness. The scene, where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the girl, is surprisingly fun, even though it is an annoying flood when caught by the police. The butler character, while much smaller, is a ray of sunlight that almost but never completely permeates through gloom. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie actually caused me physical pain. Nevertheless, there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost easy to see without starting to blister internally. Judged on his good parts alone, the film would be about a 5; unfortunately the rest of the movie does not deserve a 1. Then I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> That's pretty generous, I would say.
