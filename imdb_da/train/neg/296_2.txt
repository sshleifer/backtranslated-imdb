Despite the high ratings that IMDB users have given to this movie, this is no more than your typical girl-with-a-bad-childhood-obsessive-stalk-married-man movie. The attractive Justine Priestly's short bare scenes can attract voyeurs, but the movie is hackneyed tripe. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
