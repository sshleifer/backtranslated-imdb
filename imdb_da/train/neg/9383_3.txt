Very bad movie ........ and I mean very bad ... the plot is predictable and it is quite cheesy, the creativity of the battle and dance scenes for the time being the only reason I did not give the movie a one except from that ... this is def a movie you can afford not to see ..... i feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was an interesting one such kind of clich√© .. ... brings landbumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but I feel it could have been at least a little better if it just wasn't that cheesy, very poorly depicted from idea to screen, I think. The plot is somewhat predictable at times, tho the dance I can say AT TIMES, is pretty good, Break dance battle twist was good ..... IF you just pop the movie and watch dance scenes and make your own dialogue maybe it can be a 5. .. laugh out loud
