This absolute garbage is based so close to Friday the 13th series, which is practically a carbon copy, accepting that it is an Australian movie of non-actors. Once a young boy was accidentally burned up while recording a music video at Lake Eildon. Now, a number of years later, the boy is grown up and revenge on someone who comes to the lake to film a music video. It is the cliche ride and waste of time and money, watch it out of curiosity only, or if you are an aspiring actor trying to learn how to NOT (can't) act. Leading role Alan Dale used to steal in television-opera neighbors, but ended up in The X Files - how did it happen?
