This movie was simply bad. Almost every cop movie clich√© is present and counted. The bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie turns out grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didn't touch was the idiot shooting himself in the foot and retiron, but I guess they are saving the old chestnuts for Dooley's next trip. Add in the sex game with Girl Power along with tired old views and banal exaggerated material like Dooley's clergyman who gets rubbish all the time and you have the recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
