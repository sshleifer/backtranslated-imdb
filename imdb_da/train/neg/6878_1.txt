I'm Puerto Rican and it's one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen of any kind. You can see that the people at it are clueless. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not from there. You can see while talking that they contradict themselves. If you want to see a real one and I mean a genuine, authentic documentary from Puerto Rico, then you should see "Mi Puerto Rico". It's a serious, genuine documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was supposed to be about Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating, I didn't know. Well, it's about the only thing they are right about this so-called documentary. I hate to see such a waste being made using the island's name. It brings down the standards.
