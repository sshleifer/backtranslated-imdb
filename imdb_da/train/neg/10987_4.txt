I very much enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride' and I was thrilled to see that there was a movie version. A woman hits a policeman to her own murder, and his companion, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking on the dead woman's crazy female friends. It's fortunate that the movie script solves Mrs Atwood's clumsy planning by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of damaging women ... Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book and I am absolutely sure they are ready for the movie, I eat the dust cover on my hard copy. Apparently, the three most important female characters in the novel are not enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man's life is turned up. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - to a man. Because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed out to the side of a man's story. I don't usually look for feminist angles on the media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I hadn't read the book, I could have had the movie much more. So if you like cop and ex-cop and you want to read more about them, you have no luck. Read the novel if you want to enjoy a delicious prose and characterization, subtly stored through a plot. It's the same plot: The movie excavated it, stroked it and sprinkled it with male anxiety. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
