I agree with most of Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of other common detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point because Columbo is not a regular detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this movie that left me exciting. First, I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would be "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo stores evidence without giving cause (to viewers at least) why he does. <br /> <br /> I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
