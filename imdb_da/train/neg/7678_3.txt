This is a badly made, bad remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Now one can appreciate some creativity, but not shameful creativity. The action of everyone is influenced and the whole movie is a shame. Shekar father's choice of words in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene where Shekhar (Saif) beats Lolita is completely out of the movie's flow and the characters that are right to the senses, and it could have been easy to avoid. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is completely carefree and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys that spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is quite ok. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counters, this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance of Rekha taste of artifice and it is a set on. The song is tuneful, but I remember having heard it somewhere before, and if I didn't celebrate the tune it seems to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> It is now agreed that the times have changed from then to now. But then this film is not even reflective of modern times. This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and seizing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films do not end in India or any other part of the world.
