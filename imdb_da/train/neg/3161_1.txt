Much of the "Over Her Dead Body" is so painfully unfunny that I actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors. Eva Longoria shows that she cannot carry a movie in this horrible romantic comedy, and also that she doesn't really have any comic timing herself. She is lattice and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky mentally from dating her widow. The fiance is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the film to the anemic energy it has. I was very sorry Bell, as she seems to have some comic skills and worked overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately, she is up against the insurmountable task of making a movie containing Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is knocked down with the rest of cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of the "Titanic". <br /> <br /> "Over here dead body" has actually knocked me off because of its laziness and complete lack of effort. I began to think of all the interesting projects that cannot be funded because huge amounts of money are being penetrated into bland shit like this. Hollywood thinks seriously that movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think the cinematic public is? <br /> <br /> Degree: F
