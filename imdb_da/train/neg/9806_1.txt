I can't explain to my life what the popularity of children's TV show, power rangers is all about. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting kids liked this show at first, as the characters seem so idiotic and not worth worrying at all. The costumes look awful, like the multi-colored spandex that people are about to go to in the gym. What is the real purpose of this? Show anyway, but for children to learn to fight to solve their problems? What about the terrible haircuts and clothes on this show anyway? Not to mention this show is still playing on cable TV just to make money to teach children to fight each other when they disagree on a particular problem. There is much better entertainment for today's kids, hopefully they are not as credible as the kids from the 1990s who saw this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about the gay erotic excitement between the red and green ranks anyway?
