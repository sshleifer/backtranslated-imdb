We had to make an appointment so we turned on the DVR to record the end. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head no. I said, "So you made me see the end of this movie and I have no idea what just happened". He "didn't" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The film body itself was pretty good. There was a lot of excitement. It wondered. Then came the end. The end was ... yes it just ended. You were not turned into what happened or why. Until the credits I continued to think, something would happen to explain it, but it never did. So I came here expecting somebody to figure it out, and I just wasn't aware. Nix. Here four years later I am as unclear as Tom sawyer was. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what was going on. I'm just glad I didn't waste any $$ to buy it because I'd surely have been sour. <br /> HHHHHH! I understand it! The end of the movie is what disappeared! ROFL
