We all asked ourselves, "Why don't they re-create the slasher films, which were just OK, rather than remake those who were good already, that way they can only do better?" Well with Prom Night, they have recreated the average but eerie fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis movie and made it even BE. It's a paint of the number slasher movie that clearly tries to attract the young teens (hence no violence, etc.) The knife in this slasher flick is blunt. The director spends so much time trying to make the pretty attractive killer look a little scary that everything else goes out of the window. The throw, which includes Britney Snow (which was great in hairspray), try their hardest, but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and looks scared. Very annoying is how death scenes are handled will hear the attack but will not see it). It also seems that the only place the knife in this movie worked was in the editing package, as the movie looks as if it has been slaughtered (I guess something far-frightening ended up on the cutter base for not scaring the kids) picking up the money from the Americans sends this movie to number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are very fun, but in the Prom Nights case, I wanted to download the original. I've seen scary OC and Dawson's Creek episodes
