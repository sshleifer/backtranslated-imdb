Ivan Reitman is one of a savior. The most tired plotters (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in their skilled hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth seeing. So I was disappointed that Reitman couldn't take a pretty original plot (you dump superhero, superhero get superpower-fueled revenge), and shape it into something entertaining. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in pointlessness. The one-trick pony plot is far in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The movie can't decide if there should be romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a movie, flip-flops between both, with neither aspect being very well done. Uma Thurman is tops, as usual, and also Luke Wilson pulls away his role, although his slacker antics quickly grow tired. What is even more mad is that in some scenes (like when a very lit Uma strikes a headboard through a wall), one feels a witty, rousing Reitman opus who screams almost to get out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, gone as fast as the superhero, whose film is disappointing in almost every way.
