With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you reckon on, this won't go wrong. But what can I say? This was a terrible misfire. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly incoherent, and I didn't understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie doesn't prove it. <br /> <br /> The song about ?? Arabella Cinderella 'is pretty cool, but it is. I only recommend this movie to people who like to see an extreme news movie, this is almost the definition of one. I suppose this movie is more than anything else a sign of the times in terms of final experimentalism and all unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot, and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there. <br /> <br /> In particular, Peter Sellers is very hit and miss, he wants to leave Dr. Strangelove and be there all his career for stupid movies like this and the magical Christian who looked very much like this in context and style, but that movie had some fun moments. This one is pointless, and I'm sorry that someone as big as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended to anyone.
