First of all, this movie starts off on a really stupid note: A 10-year-old girl plays around in a moving vehicle and decides that it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and then cause a terrible accident killing her mother. duh .... I'm sorry, there's no 10-year-old that's stupid. The rest of the movie doesn't get much better. After the mother's death of the seemingly stupid 10-year-old on the planet, the father moves the family to Genoa, Italy, where he will teach at a local university, but here is the clincher: he doesn't speak an Italian word! So the little girl has "visions" of mum (who she killed), and often subsequent natterror who always always ends up with the father holding and coddling her. Then we are forced to see this family continually lost and then find and then hug and then cry and lose and then found (followed by, of course, more hug and cry) to the point that I actually wanted a form of natural disaster to just dry all these vapid, ignorant people from the planet. Don't make me wrong because I love indies, but an indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is simply ridiculous and meaningless. It is really a shame that this movie was based on such scary characters that woke up in such retarded scenarios because the local area was interesting.
