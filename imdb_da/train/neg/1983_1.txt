Oh, people came to give this movie a break. The only thing I liked about it was ......... Sorry, still thinking. Oh yeah !!!! When John Wayne came and shot up the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking of a better quality movie. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yes, the chicken that was from Clueless was in it. Do not put the Stacy Dash down. I mean, we make every mistake. But boy, Stacy, you made a dooooosie. Hey, one thing that has never been done in a western, even a whole female caste, actually hung a woman from the gallows. It can be a Western first. Even though her throat should have been broken and she survived the trial, you still have to give the instructor an effort to try a Western first. Also I've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western, even though it didn't happen in this movie, I just thought I'd give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2 to be made right after Ed Woods Bride Of The Monster # 2. Perhaps that was what the film's decision makers needed. Originality, especially with an African women's caste and an oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the makers of Gang of Roses will make a sequel to this mess, you could have such a snake as "Hey, don't take over my homegirls" and "numbers by hand, baby, numbers with the hand. "You can also have a surfer dude type substitute marshal who says things like," That gunfight was quite RAD man, absolutely. " You know things like that.
