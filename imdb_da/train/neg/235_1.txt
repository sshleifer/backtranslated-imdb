The fine cast cannot lift this routine narrative of a secretary murdered by his married paramor. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to America's "Women, Man Hates" clubs. As presented, it is the story of an innocent woman who is just "trapped" in a romance with a married, high-profile lawyer. Is it possible that IF, had she not been two timing her boy friend and had an affair with a married man, could the whole monstrous murderous, horrible incident have been avoided? When you see this, don't worry about going to the fridge, you won't miss anything.
