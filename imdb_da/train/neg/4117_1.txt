Two days after seeing this thing, I'm still sad that I've seen it. It is so bad you have to wonder how to write this tripe, much less allow it to be loose to the public. Silent, a leading man resembling sleeping, and Alison Eastwood embarrassing himself. The action is a sign of low budget film making, which means that it is painfully bad. The plot? Well, if you were 6 years old then you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and simply paralyzed.
