I just watched this movie premiere on MTV. I must say that this was extremely mediocre (at best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I felt as if there were many plot holes. There is no sympathetic sign in this adaptation due to bad action. I just find that all the characters are too possessive when it comes to a person they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They work more like brother and sister rather than boyfriends. I do not understand why the father would accept something like this under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of a few actors I respected and enjoyed watching in previous movies, but as I said, it's extremely difficult to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was terrible, which was a complete shocker. She was horrible to be Edward's bitchy older sister, and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for myself to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well, and it was great to see him in something new, and although his character was a little boiling, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they should be our heroines, but came out as whiny and over-dramatic. <br /> <br /> I just don't enjoy this movie much or the music in it. There was a short look of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but the little look wouldn't convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job convincing me that it was a movie, it wasn't. I just pictured something so completely different.
