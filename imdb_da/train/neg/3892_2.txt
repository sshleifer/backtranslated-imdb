Want to see a scary horror movie? Then you remove it. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie fun. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough scotch. Single-shot if you can. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments were not enough to keep you from watching this movie sober, let me help. NASA sends a man and two unpaid extras into the room to pave Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and the wackiness follows. <br /> <br /> I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and published only in the UK. MILES better than the movie, and the book was horrible. There is at least some kind of excitement, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out by the author (rhymes with 'gas'). Not to say that the film is completely without profit. Rick Baker learned that he really should read a contract before logging on to a movie, and Jonathan Demme found out that he really is better suited to lead. Yes, there is an MST3K episode with this flick, but of course it is edited quite a bit. Without the mandatory flashing of the breasts, even the healing of scotch cannot save you. <br /> <br /> Just look at Raiders of the Lost Ark to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I cannot in all good conscience recommend this movie to the sober film actor.
