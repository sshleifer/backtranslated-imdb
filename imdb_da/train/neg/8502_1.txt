In the beginning I find an interesting movie, a Spanish thriller in an interesting nowadays Madrid, but it is not, it is actually a film that is only interesting for future film directors who learn what not to make a movie In other words, even if the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 used to watch this movie, the play is terrible, and It seems that the actors are just waiting to end the daily shot to go home, it leads to nowhere and is boring, weak and bad, not spending time or money on this movie.
