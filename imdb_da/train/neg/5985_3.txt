This movie is just a child against evil genre. Thunderbirds are just the hook to make people see it, but are almost random in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a hassle to pull into the public. It was interesting to note what the filmmakers will look at in the future of London and how the world fits together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is some of the lines provided by Lady Penelope, which is very comical. These provided some ease for those who expect a resume of the television series. <br /> <br /> That being said, it passes 90 or so minutes in a fun way and it may just be worth seeing.
