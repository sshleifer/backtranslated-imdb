Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental waste you can ever find, but it's actually much better than you might expect. The plot's dughed could so easily have set the tone for the whole movie, but in most other departments the film is charming. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother, and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from NYC to LA to join her. So why does this horrible sound movie succeed relatively well? First, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Second, (and much more significant) it has the courage to embrace its ridiculous premise and tell a truly moving, often humorous story without worrying too much about the obvious mistakes in history. Third, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a nice villain, Gena Rowlands as a friendly old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, the smoking smoker Cheech Marin!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is audio entertainment for kids of all ages.
