A delightful mini-movie, a musical card based on three of Cole Porter's Broadway smash songs. Bob Hope's first credited movie is a pleasure! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at a table in a door cafe telling his friends about this beauty that breathes. Suddenly he throws her a few meters away. he is so over, his friends tease him and suggest "just show her your bank book." But Hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with "no" money! They spit polo ponies over the problem and take all his cash and IDs. Hope follows her, and when they are alone, she solves a suggestion, she doesn't think he's sincere before he sings to her: "You do something for me" by Cole Porter. But she must leave and he tries to make money as a tour guide so he can pursue her. But when she sees him show another girl around town, disillusioned, she will release him. He continues to chase her and catches up with her and her family on a racetrack, betting on his crooked earnings in the last race and hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!
