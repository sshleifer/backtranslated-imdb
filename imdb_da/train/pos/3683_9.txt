18 directors had the same task: tell stories of love in Paris. Of course, some of them turned out better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - wouldn't it be boring if they all had the same love of love? How to Classify the Segments (That May Change in Another View): <br /> <br /> 1. "Latin Quarter" by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors has ever directed my favorite segment with the always amazing Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Witty and lovely. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet Cute, visually impressive (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") History of a little boy whose parents are mimer; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Men's Children"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (fun); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th Arrondissement", Alexander Paynes ("Election", "About Schmidt") wonderfully look for the pathetic side of life is present here, including the underrated character actress Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby" as a lonely medieval American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's ("Run Lola Run") hectic style works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) who becomes in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", by Wes Craven, feat Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème" by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but fluid story from the talented Brazilian Directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story feat the always amazing Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but fun); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", by Vincenzo Natali, by Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille" by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underrated "My Life Without Me", feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, Feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", sometimes Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (best known as director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but not one of them is simply bad. Overall, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" an 8.5 / 10 and recommend it for what it is: a lovely mosaic of love and other things in between.
