This would have been so much fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste, which really appreciates really well-performed shocker films. <br /> <br /> The dentist is sometimes forehead probably because people usually have strong feelings about dental care. Perhaps ADA launched a campaign against it, as dentists report that they should apologize for this movie and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only one scene comparable to the many in the "Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It is amazing to note that, according to trivia, the film was shot for 21 days. Of course, post production can take longer than movie recording, and editing to the "dentist" is the picture perfect. The rapid cuts increase the excitement so much that in the scene where the dentist "takes care of" his wife, there are only two quick cuts that show what's happening. The rest is back to our very fertile imagination! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role as he has extensive experience of playing psychological "off" characters, and he completely sold the dentist's obsessive compulsive aspects. <br /> <br /> For me, pacing the movie was just right. The film authorities reveal the wife's mercy in the right way. All the signs in the dental office look like they are real people working in a real office. There are lots of tensions while dealing with impatient people awaiting the arrival of dentists. Meanwhile, the dentist is turned off because of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very tight. All victims fall into the dentist trap in very calculated ways. Two law enforcement types are even involved in a small sub-plot that ends up creating a choke for a showdown at the end. Definitely not for the faint of heart or dental phobia but a real roller coaster ride and highly recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.
