This is a really strange movie - and that is NOT a bad thing. It is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless and an adventure. I'm sure some might find this movie a little weird, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people (not actors) and achieves outstanding ensemble performance. Although it's not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point to do - it just does it in a very absurd way. Ignore the osteic special effects - it was, of course, made in the early 1950s, and special effects are still not very important (or at least they should not be in movies). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the very strange and stupid trip. Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you have a ball. By the way, since I first reviewed this movie, I've seen another DeSica movie that is an absolute must-see, and that's the kids watching us. Although it's not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, it's a great movie anyway.
