Gunga Din (1939) is based on Rudyard Kipling's poem. The film is directed by George Stevens. It is set in India in the 19th century, where three British soldiers are to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult. Gunga Din is a wonderful adventurous comedy with lots of exciting moments. The three leading men are brilliant. Cary Grant is Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen's Sgt.'Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (son of the legendary you know who) is Sgt.Thomas Ballantine. Let's not forget the other great players that include Sam Jaffe, who plays Gunga Din himself in a brilliant way. The beautiful and gifted Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It is very fun to see the difficulties of Tommy's and Emmy's wedding plans. Gunga Din is terribly fun. It can be fun, it can be exciting. It can be all that a good movie requires.
