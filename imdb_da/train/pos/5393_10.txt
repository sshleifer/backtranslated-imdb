I was probably one of the few Australians who didn't see the tennis when this series was sent. I must say when William McInnes first appeared, it's a crappy actor! But as the series continued, he fell into his performance and I loved him completely. He was such an avid guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to see Tom Long's rippling muscles! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total shock and truly brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the leading actress set an entertaining performance. I would recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a twist and see Tom Long walking around without shirt on ...
