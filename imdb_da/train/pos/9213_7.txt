Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most despicable comedies from the latest Spanish cinema (just look at his curriculum vitae), so I didn't expect so much from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... In fact, I don't know why in the world I decided to see it. Still, I just did ... And what a surprise. It seems that GÃ³mez Pereira has finally matured, and now he is able to make a good movie. His last work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointing one, and seeks another chance after you destroy it all. The last half hour of the movie (the more dramatic) is the best part, and it just makes worth seeing the movie. We also have Eduard Fernandez starring, and I continue to believe that he is the best actor in his generation (far). My rating: 7/10
