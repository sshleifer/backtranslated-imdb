Peter Ustinov plays a scammer who just comes out of prison when the movie begins. As soon as he leaves the gates, he immediately starts working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing, although this time he has seen his sights quite high. This is actually one of the weak points about the movie, as he does not know anything about computers (get back in 1968) but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yeah right. Anyway, he comes up with a scheme to emulate a computer expert and get a job with a big US company so he can finally immerse a ton of cash. Considering his computer knowledge is rudimentary, it's great how he launches a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But that's a movie, so I could suspend disbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can run away with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, it becomes very, very confusing, and Smith announces she has managed to accumulate more than two million by investing in the companies that Ustinov started (though she didn't realize that they were all dummy companies). This should mean that ultimately the stocks she bought were worthless. What they seem to mean (and I could guess here wrong) is that Ustinov and his new partners were quickly redeemed in the warehouses before it became known, and the stocks would be worthless. In any way, the movie looks at a magical end where no one is hurt and everyone is happy - and it just didn't make sense. It's a shame, really, when the actor and most of the writing was amazing. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just wonderful. <br /> <br /> If I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know as the movie seemed very vague in detail at the end.
