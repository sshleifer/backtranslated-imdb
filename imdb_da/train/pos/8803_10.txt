I just recently saw this on the Sundance channel. The idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers into their own country to make short films, eleven of them all in one movie and concentrate on a single subject: September 11th. From wacthing this movie I could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all the elements of a big movie. The movie starts with a film from Iran, where a teacher struggles to teach students what happened to September 11, which they will not do later. <br /> <br /> The second movie from France involves deaf women writing a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going on as the TV is playing. <br /> <br /> The next movie from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking to a dead soldier about recent events, not just about 9/11 terrorists, but bombing elsewhere. Next comes from Bolivia, where a girl learns about the events of September 11 and thinks they should march for them. <br /> <br /> The next from a country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man whom they believe to be Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Mexico, where nothing is shown but the sound of that day. <br /> <br /> The next from Israel, involving a reporter on a bombing scene, is trying to get a report but is often told about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can't remember at the moment, but everyone is powerful. It will bring your feelings back from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
