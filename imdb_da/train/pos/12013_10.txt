Having read the comments on this movie and seen the mixed reviews I decided I would add my ten cents worth saying. I thought the movie was excellent, not only in the visual beauty, writing, music score, acting and control, but in putting over the history of Joseph Smith and the way he traveled through suffering of adversity and persecution to believe in God as he felt and knew his way. I am very happy to have had a small role in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she can go, this only inserts one with more willingness to live the life we ​​must have with true values ​​of love and forgiveness, as the Savior taught us to do.
