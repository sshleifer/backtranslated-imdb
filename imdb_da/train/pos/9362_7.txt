Greetings again from the dark. How rare it is for a movie to investigate the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler stars as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his reason to live and no doubt his hygiene. Don Cheadle co-stars as Sandler's former dentist roommate who seems to have the perfect life (Sandler apparently had before 9/11). Of course, the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on the screen in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, that is. Seeing how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and fervent. Author / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this movie) really brings a different look to the movie. Some of the scenes do not work as well as others, but generally it is well written and solidly directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both good. Sandler's character resembles his good performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does a good job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work with a puzzle. <br /> <br /> Support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (like Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strange appealing role), Donald Sutherland as an annoyed judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really touches on how the tragic events that day hit a man so deeply that he is essentially destroyed. In addition to the interesting story and some great NYC shots, you have to love any movie that contains vocals from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder, who publishes Daltrey. Not exactly a chipper upbeat movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
