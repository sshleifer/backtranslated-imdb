It cannot be denied that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this movie is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the movie is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their struggle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep the black market traders who soon realize that they are exempt from British law does not exist rationing. When they get caught in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder, we see them fighting back against the system. They have to ration water and food in their condition to the right. In fact, getting worse than they were before it all started, this is where morale comes in. It is when they lose all the food they think they are beaten and demand a surrender, to only get the whole of London to respond to their situation by sending food, much of it. This allows them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This movie is the right tone all the way through, plays are great, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It is pitched just right, not too sentimental and the morality of history is not forced into the throat. Worth to see
