A movie made for contemporary audiences. The masses will see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensual scenes as well. This is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with the whole family. It's not for kids. I had to speed up a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just entertainment you're looking for, this movie has it all. The songs are captivating. A sumptuous production I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the message in the movie is not universal. It underlines the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do well, you get it well. And if you hurt, you will get hurt. The fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people face an evil end, many are escaping. And then there are many people who do well, and yet they meet with a sorry end. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about the message and all you want is an escape from the worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer okay.
