First of all I am a butch, just white man. But even with that disability, I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and a place. And of course New York City in the 80s. I had many gay friends grown up in New York in the eighties, and the one thing about them I always admired was their courage to live their lives as they wished to live. Whatever the consequences are. It's brave. You must admire it. This is a great movie, watch it and take in how it was to be a flamboyant African American or Spanish gay man in New York in the eighties. It's real life. The bottom line is real life.
