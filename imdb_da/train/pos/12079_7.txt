For those who think of Dame May Vitty as the friendly, slightly tedious old lady of Hitchcock's Lady Lady Vanishes, this movie requires an adjustment. Here she is anything but friendly or bitter. Instead, her son, George Macready, is the luney. Just don't give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture pillow in the house is safe. Now we know what he has in mind for the captured Nina Foch if he can just get out under the mother's dominant hand. <br /> <br /> Really tight little woman in danger film who keeps the excitement high everywhere. The manuscript never contravenes Foko's dilemma. She has been imprisoned in a large old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. They must kill her, but why. Her difficulties make no sense. The excitement moves as she tries to escape after another, but even strangers appear to her. We begin to feel her helplessness and rising paranoia, as the world turns away from her. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this movie and understandably that. So, look Foch run subtly through a spectrum of emotions without even going over the top. Witty also shines like a really scary matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just queue her wacko son. My only reservation is climax, which seems too constructed considering the time of the events. Nevertheless, it's a good, nerve-racking way to spend just over an hour, courtesy of Columbia Studios.
