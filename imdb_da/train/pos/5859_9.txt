This cool Marvel superhero game pays real tribute by staying true to the comics. Of all Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also includes the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. As you would expect, spiderman does what a spider can do. He does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he doesn't use the web in battle, he sticks and kicks too. Spidey has his hands full as he struggles with Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most of the levels are challenging, but some require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you're a true Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you, but don't expect long gameplay. Better luck in "Spiderman 2." My rating: 9 out of 10.
