1930. Stylish, elegant Adele (wonderfully played with a dignified decision by Debbie Reynolds) and bitter, frumpy Helen (the magnificent Shelley Winters go full-tilt wacko with her usual histrionic panache) are murderers' mothers. They leave their seamless past in the Midwest behind and move to Hollywood to launch their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets. Adele starts dancing millionaires Lincoln Palmer (the always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, religious fanatic Helen sinks into despair and madness soon. <br /> <br /> Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington, working from a handful of script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" was based on and starred The manuscript of "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte", adequately challenges a complex and convincing psychological terrorist about guilt, fear, oppression and religious love that runs dangerously rogue. The super-cast has a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous electoral teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a poor radio and television radio evangelist, Yvette Vickers as a meandering, indulgent mother of a bratty wannabe child star, Logan Ramsey as a snoopy Detective, and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum. A well-thought-out talent recital set with Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy's voice in "Peanuts" TV cartoon specials), serving as emcee and original "Friday the 13th" Victims, Robbi Morgan, who makes a viciously bad death-on-Mae West impression, qualifies as a particular highlight. David Raskers spooky score, a stunning scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango on a nice restaurant, the tastefully depressing era period atmosphere, Lucien Ballard's beautiful filmography and especially the eye-catching macabre ending are equally as good at the money. MGM presents this amazing gem on a nifty DVD doublebill with "Whoever Slew Tuntie Roo?" Both images are presented in sharp widescreen transfers along with their theater curtain.
