I have read countless posts about this game is so similar to Max Payne when I played it for the first time, I thought it was a little weird arcade-like game with a desire to tear off the Max Payne style (not just bullet time). So when I played it for a couple of hours, I realized how much fun it is! and how different from "Max Payne", yes the ball time is a bit similar, but I think it fits differently to the game style. This game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, so fun, like a big fan of Max Payne I have to say that the big file of DTR is not close to Maxness's greatness Payne , the graphics are a bit average, and some of the levels seem to be the same, but if you want a little more of the "bullet-time", you should definitely own this game.
