This is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story. The IMAX cameras give you a very broad perspective, like a DVD movie, it is perfect. You hear that all speakers work almost all the time. The movie is not faster and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph. Of course, there are some sound effects added, but I think they are good, they give a depth to the driving scene ...
