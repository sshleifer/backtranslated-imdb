With the amount of players they have worked with the project, they have a large selection of cast. Nice Starship CGI in places, but their green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard of Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it so they get their keys better. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, lots of features in this to keep it in the right context. BUT BUT the idea of ​​two guys kissing makes me jump out of the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can't help that I don't find men kissing entertaining (not against women). Anyway ... For a fan series, it's good stuff. With less improvement in their green screen, brush up acting and some guide ratings this series is amazing. Nevertheless, I recommend this series to anyone who has ever had TNG and DS9.
