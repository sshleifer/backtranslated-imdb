The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles she usually plays, she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-demanding character. She doesn't have a big role, but she does a good job showing Lois Harlan as a tired woman, even though she usually covers her boss's indiscretion.
