Great documentary about NY firefighter's life during the worst terrorist attack all the time. This reason alone is why this should be a must see collector's item. What shocked me was not just the attacks, but the "High Fat Diet" and the "High Fat Diet" physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think many doctors would agree with me that in the physical form they were in, some of these firefighters would not make it the 79th floor with over 60kg of gear. That said, I now have greater respect for firefighters, and I am aware of becoming a firefighter is a life-changing job. The French have a history of making good documentaries, and this is a great documentary .....
