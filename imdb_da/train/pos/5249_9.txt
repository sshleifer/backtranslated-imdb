The choice to make this SNL shit for a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not irritation humor and is also character-driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> Oddly, it seemed sexual content could be avoided, but it may have been because the TV set limited me to not expecting it. I suppose I was thinking more "Leisure Suit Larry" risqu√© than the producers were ... Absolutely not a PG-13 movie that is likely to damage it from reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors, but still better assuming and writing than its more stupid. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it will be a smash hit ... (which is sad, as Tim Meadows tends to not make signs annoying me with quite the frequency others SNL alumni tend to)
