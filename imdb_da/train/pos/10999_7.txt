This movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company called Digicorp. This wimpy guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. He supposes to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the business plans. Instead, Morgan finds herself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and is largely double crossed by these two companies, forcing him to become a dual agent. How does Morgan get out of this? Can he rely on the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan make it alive? Wow! What a nifty movie! I was totally sucked in after 15 minutes to watch this movie. It's very exciting and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he does his best to stay alive. The scene where they put this horrible contrast on Morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliant scary and scary. Morgan goes through a personality transformation that is not so easy until you think about it after the movie is finished. From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he becomes a man who is actively fighting for his life. The end, wow, the end is incredible! Twist is so much fun! It left me shivering and cheering like crazy! Great performances from all over the world, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
