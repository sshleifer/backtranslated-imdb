I became a fan of the television series `Homicide: Life on the Street 'late in the show, but became a fan very quickly. It was a policeman unlike any other: visually different in the use of handheld cameras, considering the viewer everywhere with his multi-ethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and covering everything good and evil by a police officer including corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /> <br /> Murder: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a movie to television can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a mayor of Baltimore, has been shot, the series cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died also managed to get their place in the movie. The intensity and fire that marked the series returns, and the manuscript brushes with the same brand that marked the series. All in all, a fantastic TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
