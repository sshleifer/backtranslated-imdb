To all yall who think 1.This was a boring telecast 2.Halle Berry and Denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> OFF F ** K UP !! This was one of the best academic awards because 1. Having a black yes "Black actress" winning an academic award for best actress was a moment in history so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the Academy in many year. To be honest, I had stopped seeing the academy competitions because of the lack of diversity of either the winners or the nominees. For me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back. The Academy had many chances to vote for black actresses who were brilliant in film, for example. Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but it didn't. 2.Halle Berry deserved that Oscar no competition, the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long, deserved actresses have been ignored by the academy, the majority of which consist of white voters yes yes, Nicole kidman sang very nicely in muling rouge ! But it was time for black people to be accommodated in these prices. As for Mr Washington, the Academy owed him a great deal of time after the unjust loss for MalcomX. To all of you who believe that race is not a problem "probably white people" in the film industry, yes, many of the most talented black actresses around, have either been reduced to stereotypically made by white people roles of what they think is a black woman or is not existence "angela basset". I don't expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never needed to deal with any of it. Come to think of it, they are the one who has inflicted it
