This movie chronicles the lives and times of William Castle. He made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s and 1960s, which he sold with gimmicks. In "13 Ghosts" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in b & w). "The Tingler" had theater seats equipped with a buzzer that shot the audience when a monster escapes to a cinema. "Marabre" issued a life insurance to all members if they were afraid of death! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them. In this document there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors in his film and his daughter. It also comes into his home life and the kind of man he was (of all bills he was a good guy). Documentary is loving, very fun and absolutely nineteen. It is very short (under 90 minutes) and there is never a dull moment. One should watch for slot fans and horror movie fans. My only complaint - there were very few sequences shown from his pictures. That apart from this is just amazing.
