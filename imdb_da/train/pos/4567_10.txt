My left foot is an epic excellent movie that explains Christy Brown's life and times, which had cerebral palsy, a severe disability and only used his left foot, but he was tired, he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds. > <br /> I've seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I find it just as brilliant every time. I wonder how did this amazing movie not an oscer for the best picture, it's a shambles of academy prizes. Jim Shirdan is me one of the greatest directors in the world. The play, the music and everything else is excellent in this movie. As the film continues, you will almost feel in the brown household as everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing as Cristie's parents and Fiona Shaw are just as brilliant as dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy with her hardship. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry had noticed much about its name before my left foot. My left foot was the start of a wonderful period in Irish film. movie as powerful and brilliant as the field, the crying game in the father's name and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were considered so high around the world and were nominated for several Oscars and won some, A wonderful period for Irish film. My left foot is a powerful excellent movie. Daniel Day Lewis plays the precocious Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly, as does Hugh o Conner, who plays young Christy. Two me these two performances are two of the best ever movie performances, especially Daniel Day-Lewis performance, which I would consider as high as Antony Hopkins in the Lamb's silence. Daniel Day-Lewis has shown in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie masterpiece, watch it!
