This movie was as good as some of the other westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend of the River. This movie starts as a run of the mill western, but becomes more complex as it progresses. It starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arrives in Seattle, and Stewart is accused of murder. He is found innocent, but the cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then accepts to lead something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart just cares to get his cattle back. As the movie goes along, it's as if Stewart only cares about himself like his character in the Naked Spur. It gets much better halfway after arriving in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's better westerns.
