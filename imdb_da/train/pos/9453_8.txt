Releasing is James Dickey's fascinating, eerie and sometimes disturbing story, transformed into a brilliant movie by John Boorman. These are four businessmen driven by crew and macho behavior who spend a canoe weekend high up in the mountains. Then they face every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement, but their turn soon turns into an odyssey through a fierce and lurking mountain land, completely devoted to all forms of civilization. All of these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish movies I've ever seen. Almost everything that happens to these men asks you to never find yourself in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is also a very important movie. John Boorman's best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film, and it features several memorable scenes already in countless other movies. Just think of the amazing "Dueling Banjo" musical score and of course the unforgettable gay "peel like a pig" rape scene. All actors deliver (haha) perfect actors. Especially Jon Voight. A must see movie !!
