Just seen this after my mother brought it back from America for me, was horrible to see this after all the negative comments here, but I have to say yes the play is cheesy, some of the effects are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But remember that this was supposed to be in 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I have read the book so many times and I have found that I go "ahh yes it is in the book" almost all the time with the second version was almost nothing of the book. <br /> <br /> So well done to at least try to make a real version.
