If Dick Tracy were in black and white, the Pope would not be religious. Giving a new feel to the concept of color in a movie, we are offered a unique experience throughout the comic-strip world, and it is one of the few films that succeeded, thanks to a serious script, good direction, good Performances (Al Pacino is astonishing) and most importantly a strong blend of filmography, art direction and costume design. Use only primary colors, the experience is quite different from what we have seen before. And there is also a pretty successful homage to all the gangster movie genre that is extinct from modern cinema. All in all, I see this movie as a new experiment and an original print for a movie theater that increasingly depends on the old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10
