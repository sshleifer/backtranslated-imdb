This movie is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' excellent portrayal of John Lennon. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't look like Lennon; His mannerisms, expression, attitude, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best scene: Lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan of whether Paul McCartney & Wings' "Silly Love Songs" is worthy of status # 1 in America.
