This is best showing what I think Jesus really was. Most films show jesus as being widespread, lobotomized or tortured. this jesus laughed, played and was serious when needed. This is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to, not the usual Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The movie took some freedoms and tried to "fill out the topics". But fillers did not seem impossible or even unlikely. One thing I might have to argue was that it never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (films depicted that the Romans were the main driver of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea). <br /> <br /> it seemed that the film was well researched. one example was the offman commentary to a teenage boy who was called "mark". It is believed that the mark (or John Mark) was referred to the boy in Gethsemane Garden, whose robe was pulled off and ran away naked (Mark 14:51). I get the feeling that they tried to make the film so accurate (even in the spirit) as much as possible.
