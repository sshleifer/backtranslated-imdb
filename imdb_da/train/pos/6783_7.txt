If you like "Othello", you'll love this flick, as half of the movie is about the stage production of the game. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colman's life, while Edmond O'Brien plays the entertaining press agent. A couple of the supporting players I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle, and Joe Sawyer, the 1940's reply to Drew Carey, who plays the policeman on the case. <br /> <br /> Big red moments in this with no realism all the way through.
