Now I've really seen this movie, it was so much fun. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think after watching this movie, they have to make many more films together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dancing 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles when you get out the door and so the other was just so funny to see he acted really well in his movie, and i hope he makes more great comedy like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role really well and he is so underrated. I'm glad that some of his amazing works have been noticed, but he is a really good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. The museum is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
