No better destroy this job! Awesome movie! Written academically by people like Ira Levin and depicted with Christopher Reeves' career and one of Caines best, it is simply excellent. I wish I could catch a staged version somewhere ... maybe one day I want to. I hope this grossly undervalued, overlooked movie has not become too difficult to locate because it is a "must" for any Hitchcockian, Agatha phile or lover of great movie. One of very few movies I couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth another or even third view, "Deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and earns every iota of it. We need and deserve more movies like this!
