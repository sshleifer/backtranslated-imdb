I chose to watch this movie at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best films in the festival. Both leading players deliver a well-rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director did a good job that brought the signs and history to life with skills that are not normally seen in a first-time production. An interesting aspect of this movie is the love of woodwork and New York City (Brooklyn in specific). The film is about family furniture that does business and weaves delicate filmography of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life ?? Again kudos to the director about this nice choice. <br /> <br /> This is gem and I would totally recommend it (I'm sure it will make it to the screen).
