Answer: Despite the fact that this film is written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier and more irrational than any zombie who ever lurched the earth. <br /> <br /> Acting in this autonomous movie is actually pretty good, despite the less than wonderful script. It requires a really good actor to deliver an overwritten clich√© line and make it sound faintly credible. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, has a particularly good performance. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this movie is much better than the dialogue. Try it, especially if you are not a monster fan. This is not a horror flick. Although all adult women are rather monstrous, and although all adult men seem to have their brains eaten in a former zombie movie, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for adult adults. All this time is much better than the sum of its parts.
