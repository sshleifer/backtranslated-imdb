While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not animated version), I still think it was a little under what Disney could do. It was well filmed, the music was more suited to the action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The action was perhaps better, but the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel, and Glenn Close is really not to be missed as in the first movie. She makes it shiny. Her poor shortage and the supernatural furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play out, and they add to the play that Disney has given us. This is a great family movie, with little or no offensive material, yet it is fun and interesting for both adults and children. It's bound to be a classic like so many Disney movies are. Here is to hope that the third is even better still - because you know they will probably make one. ;)
