This movie reminded me that some old Black & White movies are definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> Initially, I had some reservations, but from the beginning of the movie to the end I was impressed with. I was very impressed with the mix of drama, excitement and comedy. Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and had me stitching all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this movie to your movie night for a little relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or overly "funny" movies today.
