I enjoyed this movie, and after seeing it, I wondered how many 'Caitlin Rose' exist in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this type of sexual abuse and plagiarism by classmates and have been too scared to open their mouths about it? Just how threatening and cruel, teens can be against each other, because, as this film demonstrates who is right, is not most important, the one who is popular and feared, who manipulates the minds of adolescents and affects them to allow this kind of immorality. Thiessen gives a strong performance as a rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is convincing when the guy intervened between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. It's the kind of movie that doesn't get the exposure it deserves. Marketable and brilliant, too good to be just a movie made for television.
