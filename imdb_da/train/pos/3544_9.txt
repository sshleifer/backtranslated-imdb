Guys and Dolls should be one of my favorite musical films ever. It's a very funny movie to watch and no more. It highlights what people have forgotten the musicals-musicals were made to entertain, not to preach. Today we rent and chicago, which are good musicals and good movies, but they fail to bring us solid entertainment without any tightening. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can't sing! Listening to him singing and speaking was very annoying when I couldn't understand him. If it wasn't for Marlon, I would have given this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls provide old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. See it for good !!
