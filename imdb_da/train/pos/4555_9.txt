Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this imaginative film tells the story of his life that he is afflicted with cerebral palsy and is considered essentially not a person of all including his mother. Incredibly, he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can control. An amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable Oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis. 9 out of 10
