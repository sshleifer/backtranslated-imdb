I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie did an excellent job. In conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you for any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who hasn't seen it. You are in too much laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, save back with a friend and see it.
