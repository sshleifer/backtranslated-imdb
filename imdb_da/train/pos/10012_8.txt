Night Listener is probably not one of Williams' best roles, but he does a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different film. I can guarantee you never saw this kind of movie before. Some people may not like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think it's the big plus for the movie. It is definitely one of the best films that came out in 2006. It has an exciting performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feeling. This is no American movie. Nor is it a predictable movie. You just feel it is a movie that has secrets that you find difficult to determine what the outcome of it can be. This is not an excellent movie that has everything but hell, it is a wonderfully good and very original movie.
