This fun little noir boasts a topcast and many memorable scenes. The big distraction is the complete disregard of authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (French), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to top it all, Bacall must be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene where Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and talk in wildly different accents, is a real hoot! And I guess, as they were alone, they should actually have spoken in Spanish anyway! It seems rather strange that the brothers Warner could not find any Spanish-speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood has often had a "any old accent will do" policy - my second favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro) . Maybe they should have Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - he would have been great in Boyer's role or at least in Francens (who would have saved a lot on the dark make-up budget).
