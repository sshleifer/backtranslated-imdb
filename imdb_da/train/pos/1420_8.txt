For the celebration of Earth Day, Disney has released the movie "Earth". If we stop being far away from any strong message of gloom and doom, we will be treated with some good pictures of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a bunch of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf. The story begins at the North Pole and continues south until we reach the tropics, which are constantly being introduced to citizens in the various climatic zones being crossed. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned as we see the polar walks bear; Note is made of the shrinking sea islets in recent years. We never see bears catching any seals, but the father's desperate quest for food leads him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> The aerial images of caribou migrating across the tundra are one of the most spectacular wildlife skins I have ever seen saw; it and another of migrating wild birds is enough to reward the admission price to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise great shots of big white sharks that took seals were filmed in slow motion. You never get the feel of a characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie to convey great speed I think began with (or at least the first thing I remember seeing) the TV show "Kung Fu" in the early 70s. An interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll at the end, some demonstrations of the applied cinematographic techniques are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and educational moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for natural buffers. Perhaps because of some selective edits (saving us as it was from the pigs end of a prey predator) and the fact that this recording had been released in 2007 and available on DVD, it is a solid movie in itself. And you can take your kids! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
