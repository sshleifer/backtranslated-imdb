Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and all the other actors and actresses in "Men of Honor" have combined to make this a good movie. Mark Isham wrote the film competition, so you also know that the music is good too. But: After noticing a kill of goofs, loopholes and over-dramatic punches right from the start, I had to make a promise to ignore them and lean back to enjoy the movie. If you can do that, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a real life hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Look him up on the internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the movie that the director admitted in his comments. There were only three African-American American navy divers in World War II. But no one reached the status of US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American American navy master diver. AND he was the first amputee diver to be certified or re-certified as an American marine diver. (Resounding applause). On the negative side of the film's main book: Should I only tell you about one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I mark this comment as "spoilers" and do it ... The early, pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: They would never have had time to watch out for Mark V diver even though he was the legendary master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to be only "... a few minutes late" to rescue the pilot. <br /> <br /> So for loopholes, goofs and overdramatisation, I dismissed "Honor Men" from a perfect 10 down to a 7. <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood ever realize that the untrusted truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to storytelling? I doubt it. Too bad!
