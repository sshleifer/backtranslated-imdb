to see this as a child. Even though I find it scary now, it was sweet to scary things, since I was only seven or so. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon puzzle while you watched it, so I wasn't really paying attention. But the scene with the rolling stones has been burned in my mind ever since. I have asked many people if they have seen this flick but to no avail. 12 years ago, a person mentioned that he might have seen it, but he just thought it was a dream; an imaginative piffle like wind. It's no dream, my friend. No one is dreaming now. Again I haven't seen it since then, but I can't wait to find a copy and put it in my VCR. Everything that can be embedded in my eye for 23 years deserves a '10'.
