This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel more understanding about Joseph Smith's life. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and life-changing film that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I watched this movie with my family, and I can testify that we have all had a change of heart. This film allows people to truly understand how hard life was for the Prophet and how much tribulation he was confronted with. After I watched this movie, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was touched by what they saw, and I haven't been the same since I've seen it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
