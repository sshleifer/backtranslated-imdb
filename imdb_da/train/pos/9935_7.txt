My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * staggering * CHOP} mine - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playback} <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen an instructor so much flat for his style. At present, it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's choppy, flashy, dizzying editing method. If I have to choose to love it and hate it, I want to say I love it. It was sometimes disturbing in the border, but the end result was pretty good, and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (though it borrows heavily from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge manifests as Keira Knightley plays the role of the jealous badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems weird. Otherwise, she plays her badly because I largely hated her character and did not sympathize a little with her, however much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins with other bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew gets mixed up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walk's television production company (what does Christopher Walken do in each movie by the way?). I think it's a smart movie technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use so much showy MTV / Reality Show editing as he likes. It will be a pastiche of MTV culture at this time. It then follows that the story is told in an astoundingly fast fire pace with lots of violently strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes; It is all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty enjoyable mess. It is ultimately defective in many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool" to one), but it works. I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graduated this movie ?? But I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
