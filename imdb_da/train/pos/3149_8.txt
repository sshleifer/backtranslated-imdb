Not since The Simpsons made it to the debut there has been a sitcom that I didn't want to turn off in 2 minutes. Of course it has been said that The Simpsons killed sitcom. Not the one himself. <br /> <br /> The first season was when teenagers were not as scandalous as they were later. They even went to school at times. The following seasons character where fledged out. Eric, the sarcastic twit, Donna, his flat-eyed girlfriend, Kelso, the black bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and the anti-establishment punk, Fez, the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie, the spoiled rich floozy. As for the adult figures, there was Eric's mother, "can you believe she's so creepy" subverts mother, Eric's father, the straight arrow, which of course was not as harsh as he thought, Donna's stupid father and her stupid blonde mother. Everyone is true to their characters, but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who find the perfect balance between toughness and still make his Red Foreman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness. <br /> <br /> Of course, Topher Grace is the main reason why this show is so good. It is a tough character to play because it does not allow the actor to indulge in wildly overbearing as Kelso character, played by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed watching the two characters interact because they are the most diverse. Hyde's character is a little harder to enjoy because he is more realistic, and we really need to see the orphan story for the deepest time, even if I say the authors came up with a brilliant story arch for him in the last seasons. Jackie, played by Family Guy Vocalist Mila Kunis, is funny and she has nails on a blackboard type of voice that actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and Eric because they were greeting together. Too much history was wasted on her relationship problems, as we already got it in spades with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Lastly, I would say that the casting of guest actors was always fantastic. A few favorites: Fez's humongous girlfriend in the middle season, Pastor Dan, the amazing Leo played by the equally amazing Thomas Chong, another of Fez's girlfriends, who is fully certified and a special look of teenage witch Sabrina like a plain Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Coming up next at Fox, whatever.
