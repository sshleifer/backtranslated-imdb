It seems more than odd that such a pronounced boy like "Hukkerne Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (the new version) can find DVD distributors, while older - and far superior works like this movie - do not exist. With all the ongoing debate on the morality (or lack thereof) of warfare and interest in espionage (consider the many Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible" productions, this seems to be an obvious choice for DVD publishing. Really like a 1968 movie, because it is a 1968 movie. But style consideration aside, it is still a production that actually has something valuable to say and has lots of plots of twists to keep an audience entertained. Nothing else, you will consider getting the soundtrack on a kind of CD, whether it's compilation with other Morricone music or as an independent, I don't know if the industry is bothering to read what our fans should say about their products, but If you read this and other comments, take us seriously. We pay for your sumptuous home with our hard earned dollars spent on tickets, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want! you read this and have not seen this movie, l obby for it's release so you can see what those of us who have seen it are talking about. You will not be disappointed.
