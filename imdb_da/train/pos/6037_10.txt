What a great British movie, a screaming good laugh and sexy Gary Stretch too, and oh, lots of bikes and lovely Welsh scenery. <br /> <br /> Members of our club appear ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club in it as extras! Cheers !! <br /> <br /> There are some really hilarious bits, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> Meet director Jon Ivay at a show in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down to earth and a good laugh. This movie should be supported as any great Brit movie should! <br /> <br /> Go and see it, if you can, they have a site with cinemas showing it, then find one near you! <Br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have seen the movie two or three times and can't get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
