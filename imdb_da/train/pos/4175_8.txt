I've always wondered what happened to the magical kind of feeling that the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... Well, I wondered with time whether that feeling was just nostalgia. Or did the "feeling" decide to pack his bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our movie history, and never came back? Or did it? Because for me it came back the first time I saw "Express, Express". And that was the old one again. <br /> <br /> There are three qualities of this movie that make it something unique and enjoy as it should - the smooth flow of history, the warmth of colors and what I appreciated most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something many other (not just) Slovenian screenwriters should at least consider). There is no need for words when you can understand each other as well (yes or better) in other ways that are in use. Just see Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. Therefore, it is only in so many words that I would recommend "Express, Express" to all of you, as a must-see Slovenian film, whatever you may have heard of Slovenian films (if you have ever heard anything, it is .. .). <br /> <br /> Oh, and the scene where Bakovic dances to Vivaldi's music ... A treat. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. See it.
