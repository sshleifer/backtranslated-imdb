"Girlfight" follows a New York high school project home from a sense of futility in the world of amateur boxing, where she finds self-esteem, purpose and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, everything is about the movie. So much you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is no chick flick and not "Rocky". Rather, it is a very human drama that even viewers who do not know boxing will be able to connect with.
