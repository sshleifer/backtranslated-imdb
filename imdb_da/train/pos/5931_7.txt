Although written by Stephen King, an overrated writer, if ever there, this is actually entertaining B-movie. Vampiric, incestuous creatures living in the luminous house and draining the vitality of the virgins, great cemeteries, heroic cats and very beautiful virgin. The soundtrack even has Eny's music, an idea that I found quite ... nice. I'm sure King is disappointed with this little movie, even though it has crazy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and boring King pot boiler. (Although Sleepwalkers, if I understand correctly, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, they show the touches of the sewer he didn't use a ghost writer.
