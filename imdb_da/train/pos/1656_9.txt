"Thieves and liars" present us with a very naturalistic depiction of the levels of corruption affecting many Puerto Ricans and forcing them to make difficult or not impossible choices about their and their dear lives. The cast is excellent, given that some are non-professional actors; an excellent choice that enhances the reality of the film. The photograph evokes the story without burglary, as it should be in this type of movie. The script captures idiosyncrasies and attitudes toward "Boricuas" in a very deep way. Sometimes it feels like you are seeing a documentary! When you watch this movie, you feel as if you have secretly entered the real Puerto Rican community and are invisible to see it implode. I loved it!
