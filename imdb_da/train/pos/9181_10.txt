I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I had read and so many classics before, and I thought most classics were boring, overall and overrated stories with moderately interesting plot at best. This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my beliefs. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a great actress and she gives a wonderful portrayal of Jane Eyre. Her accent is lovely and her quiet, but solid nature exactly matches the character of the young management person. Timothy Dalton is a wonderful Rochester. His passion and energy in the movie makes me believe he was born to play the thrilling master of Thornfield Hall. I couldn't sleep the whole night after I had seen these miniseries. The ground is both exciting and inspiring. The characters are masterfully performed and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre that ever appears on film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how closely these ministries followed Charolette Bronte's writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. To see a masterpiece that will change your life, see the 1983 version of Jane Eyre.
