Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has, in recent years, been enchanted by Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film series for a series of games. But none of them have really captured his spirit. The games are usually independent, the TV series were more spinning, and the less said about Verhoeven's movies, the better. A little bit at the most, however, that in Japan there had already been an animated adaptation, released the year of Heinlein's death. And believe it or not, in spite of the differences, this 6-part animated series is suddenly the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic. The most obvious plus for this series is the presence of the exoskeletons of the powered armor, something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the signs and their relationships than on action and space travel, even though we see quite a few of them. While events happen differently than in the book, the feeling of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic interference, but it's just a little more affected than in the book. While some might think the dialogue and character interaction is a little subordinate to the book (it gets a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's far better than the movie. Heinlein's political view is simply carved, unlike the film where they return. The big payout of the series, however, is the climatic battle of Klendathu between the troops and bugs / aliens, which contains that kind of action from the powered armor funnels we would have liked to see in a movie version. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinleins. And I think they did fine with this. If you can find this series, give it a look.
