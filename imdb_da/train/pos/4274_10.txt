I like this movie, but it is a fact that you cannot understand it unless you are from ex-Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and they were the best actors in ex Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can get it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. All this was ex Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balcan nations. It could be a dream land if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would not poison the nation's mind with their ill ideas.
