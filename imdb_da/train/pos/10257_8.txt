what can i say about this movie that has not already been said? Well to tell the truth, much of it looks very fake like some of the beats and kicks. how Charlie Sheen though this was right, I don't know. I'm sure they would hit and kick her much harder if it was. But the scenes with squeezing and the hot oil look very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is incredibly made and is probably the only thing on movies that has ever shocked me.
