There were many films made by Hollywood in the war designed to drum up support for our troops from the public. Seen today, some may reject them or just see them as propaganda - as they are technically, but of a positive kind and believed to unite the nation. This film is a rather effective and entertaining example of the genre - has a fairly realistic script and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other movies (you know the hard-talking, hard-driven but "bulging guy"). Randolph Scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombarders in training). While the story is reminiscent of several other films about our pilots and crews, the film is well designed to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That maybe, except in the end - where the film is a bit over-the-top but also very satisfying. About the only serious negative, and it is mostly for nitpickers, that some of the stock films are somewhat bluntly integrated into the film and "nuts" like me, who are both history teachers and air lovers will probably see it here - everyone else certainly will not note.
