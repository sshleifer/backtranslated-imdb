Finally came to see this classic movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS, it's a classic piece of horror. It is a shame more of this neglected corner of horror in the form of official releases on the DVD and the VHS ... television horror movie. Recommended for all fans of 70's television films, like trilogy of terror. Those interested should get the book on the subject of David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70's. Send me a chance to see it ..... it's great to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems like many TV movies, they must be quite inventive in the effect dept and even at 70 minutes it may seem to be pulling we are all used to more modern editing but still good things and far better than many theatrical frights released today.
