Maxx is a deep psychological introspective, easily camouflaged as a strange superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in a named dirty city, run with crime, and she and everyone she knows have many problems to work through. Maxx is her friend and client, a street bum who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> Maxx must not miss the work of art, the story itself or the excellent voice work - especially the late-night rampant's delicious urban, dripping evil tones of the greatest villain, Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this, don't miss it.
