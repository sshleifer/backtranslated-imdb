The person's comment, saying that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil, has nothing to compare, what evil and fair is. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! He doesn't even know he fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you don't know God and refuse to know him now, it's okay. He still loves you, but when you finally bend your knee to him and you will, it will be too late for you. God sends no one to hell, not even you! You will take your own choice and your spewing will define it! May God be merciful to you and give you a Damascus Road experience. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson's Ministry is one of the reasons I am still here. On the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God reached through the television screen and used Pat Robertson to do so, and thank God he did! You have the right to say what you said, but you have no right to curse your words. God has mercy on you.
