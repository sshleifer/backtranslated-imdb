Absolutely brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most compelling documentary series ever made about war. It's tone gives a sharp contrast to the often-gung-ho attitude towards World War II that the media is showing. Instead of screaming about the horror of war, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war: Located everywhere, explosions, frightened citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, errors that cost thousands life, innocent suffering. Most of all, the real home brings with it that humanity is capable of removing all normal "nature" rules. There is something clearly Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years. Perhaps there could be a follow-up series called "Century of War" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horror. I feel it is a huge size irony that took an event that led 50 million people to produce such a compelling and outstanding series like this.
