The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad, but it's really not that good. The editing is good; the film is well-educated. The direction is competent and secure. The story is plodding. The film is averagely acted by Ledger, Bloom, and the usually great Watts and Rush. The centers are impenetrable if you are from the United States, so just sit back and enjoy nature (or I can call it Orlando Bloom). At the end of the movie I was not bored or moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say I didn't care about that point. Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom kind of shows some reach tips (though often present "I am beautiful and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls can find it worth the matinee price. Apart from that, you just can't see it. It is neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining.
