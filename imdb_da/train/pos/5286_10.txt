Part of what was so good about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irreverence and how they were not afraid to do whatever they wanted. In this case, Marvin Martian has a task to bring back a grounding. Surely he comes across Bugs Bunny, who warns against a mutiny from Marvin's dog. After that Marvin finally traps Bugs - using an Acme-strait jacket-exhaust bazooka! - Bugs have several things planned for the journey back to Mars. What I mean is if you thought it was a big change in the solar system when they removed Pluto from its planet state, then you haven't seen anything yet! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" goes completely out. How they buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean "hare" - is having fun. And believe me, you will. After all, a small space-out never damages anyone.
