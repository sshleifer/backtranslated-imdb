If you like CB4, you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this movie yet. This movie is crazy hilarious and contains much more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on DVD because it is a movie that everyone I have ever seen it with has loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school artists, you can rentley rent this movie. There are not so many video rental sites that have copies of it, but if you happen to come across one, you won't be disappointed.
