If any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it is this rare gem. It allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun. Filled with heart and laugh, this show keeps you laughing over the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful and even the fabrics were tolerant. The hair was removed, the music was accompanied by roller blades, and in Merle Haggard's words, "a link was a bad place to be". Take a trip back to the greatest time in American history. Fall in love with characters and feel the good essence of the little town where people were nicer to each other. This classic is on TV as much as "Full House". Don't miss it and always remember to "Shake your groove stuff !!!"
