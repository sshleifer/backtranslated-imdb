I couldn't believe in the low 5.6 rating on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously at the moment I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote the memorable piece of comedy as much as I can. Seriously, in order to get a rating so low, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very low open mind. If you don't like humorous flicks, don't see them! The combination of absurd humor, a very good storytelling and an excellent pace given by the many running gags, this film has entered into my DVD collection. And it is without mentioning the visual fares embedded here and there and of course the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite organized crime films. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to many people and was introduced to it without any specific expectations (except perhaps to see a comedy) - quite state of mind you have to see any movie in my opinion - they all liked it much. It is going well, it is not long to see, and there is absolutely no slowing in the development of the story, which I think is really straightforward. Sure it's not perfect, some gags fall a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other opinions like yours. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This film is, in my opinion, a precursor like "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in absurd but deliberate comedies. Which is today more and more absurd while cutting the thought and the curiosity side. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people imagine to be properly understood, if at all. As a last word I would like to say: see for yourself, do not follow the average Joe's proverb, and if you do not like it then you really know it was not good for your taste, which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion.
