In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphans sent to them is a perishable girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris - a veteran of Disney's series of "Alice" shorts, who would later adopt her character's name). <br /> <br /> Anne was just 11 in Lucy Maude's Montgomery's source novel, but the same actress couldn't credibly go from 11 to college age during the story. The film suffers from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining, coming from an eleven-year-old from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, eager to please, but unhappy with her name, her structure, her fringe and her long red hair. Being a child of fantasy, however, Anne takes great pleasure in life and quickly adapts to her new family and environment on Prince Edward Island. In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the film's writer chosen to focus on this aspect of her character. That transformed the basic genre from mildly fun family drama to comedy. A change that pleases the audience and it continues to disturb readers. <br /> <br /> As the comedy is very much in Montgomery's history, I can't see any reason to address the issue of change, but let it act as a reasonable warning to anyone who expects a complete faithful adjustment. The comedy element is the strength of the movie, as it is one of the earliest self-reflective parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actor Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's beautiful beauties and the movie is black and white. So much of the pleasure is to see the title of the character's endless heads about her appearance and hair color opposite of what appears on the screen. Anne regularly counts her nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: "If you refuse, it will be a lifelong grief for me". Perhaps it's the funniest moment when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a great job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steal all the scenes where she appears as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
