The movie Titanic makes it much more than just a "night to remember." It again writes a tragic story event that will always be spoken about and will never be forgotten. Why then criticized? I have no idea. Could / will they ever make a movie like Titanic that moves and touches every time you see it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It becomes almost impossible. The director has no doubt had the greatest influence on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring to see) converted to an incredible romance. Yes, I'm also not the Romance type, but it shouldn't disturb you, because you'll never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything for the amazing effects, for the music, for the sublime play. <br /> <br /> The movie creates a fantastic visual and wonderful feeling. Everything looks very right and lives. The legend itself "TITANIC" appears brilliantly in all classes, also looking for accommodation. The action was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best to play there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so big. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's too much to talk about. The reason is simple. The action is brilliant, based on a true story. Probably more than half of the consumers watching the movie will share tears thanks to a conceivable ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you haven't seen this movie, you miss out on something Hesterish and a movie to idolize to Hollywood. Can it get better? No not at all. The most moving movie all the time, not listen to people, see for yourself, then you will understand. A landmark. (Don't be surprised if you cry too)
