Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. Successful and not to varying degrees. Buddhist monk has a vision of killing a legendary (and very active) demon at the Gojoe Bridge for enlightenment. While not at the forefront, Buddhist thoughts are at the heart of this movie, like Kurosawa's "Ran". It was probably what made the movie the most interesting to me even though it is now close to the "Rans" league. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie most interesting during the two hours and eighteen minute length. The main players are uniformly excellent. The music is really good. The two weaknesses are the story and the battle scenes. The film draws in the middle, which could have been directed by a careful editing. And the battle scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups. This works mostly for the movie, but the final feels like a cheat. Another recent movie like this is Tsui Hark's "Seven Swords", great movie, but the promised battle scenes are disappointing. Asano does not move like a sword-killing demon, but his performance is great, but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara battle scene. <br /> <br /> Good movie you will probably find interesting just don't expect traditional swords fighting.
