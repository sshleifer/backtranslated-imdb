This is so exciting! After I saw "La Roue" this afternoon, a short, light-haired little movie, I consider this one for a good experience! This is quite nice and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. The more amazing it is as it is an early talkie and puts some good pictures of the 30s to shame because of its innovative use of sound in cinema. It is simply filled with music and a sweet mood that is really optimistic and in the bottom line it has made me happy! Obviously, it wouldn't be so hard to get the lottery ticket that the male leader was looking for, but the pace is so exciting and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that I didn't even think twice about it. Comedy is many times fun, and I think it's even better than Marx Brothers, possibly the greatest comedic power of the time. This is quite perfect.
