Rated E (Contains Violence). <br /> <br /> I had the original spiderman game for the PC for a couple of years now. I still haven't beaten it because in Windows XP there is an error at a level that I can't blame So be warned if you have XP. But for those who don't have XP, give this game a try. It's a fun clean family game of action and it's great for any spiderman fan.In the game you play spiderman and you take on various criminals who commit crimes.Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent who wants a fun, clean game for their children. <br /> <br /> 8/10
