Vladimir Navokov's literary genius is brought back on display and many in the cultured world will notice it. The director puts us in companion with the story of Alexander, an absent-minded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. Nastasya is on holiday in a marble pillar resort where a chess championship is hosted. She meets Alexander by gathering a queen piece he falls through his coat pocket. A magnetic attraction develops, suggesting the next day, the mother disturbed the telegram man. He arrives and asks Alexander, we get these fathers to the past, ala 'Godfather II, where we see young Alexander, a child's marvel. He is taken under a school teacher wing and utilizes his genius for 10 years and makes large sums. Thinking Alexander reached its peak, surrendering him but becoming legendary. The old teacher returns and causes harm and tries to win an old rival Alexander. In a serious chess game where the World Chess Champion victory is a way of exercising is the chess watch, the time to end the next day ends. That day, Nastasyas wedding, the old teacher interferes, and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking through the coat of love finds her strategy for the fight and follows the movements. Although the film unfortunately swears from its Russian roots, its low backpacks dress is lovely, Alexander plays its part sublime. The conductor underestimated his audience, we barely going to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens, isolating the opponents king with your 3 paws and king, sacrificing the palace for buddy. Nastasya is a great match, but feels its conclusion deserved more intensity, but perhaps the feelings were right at check for chess meant more to him than her. Luzhin defense gives elegant Navokov honor, the complexity of its work in images is a world event that one must not miss.
