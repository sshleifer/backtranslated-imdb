Bravo to Czechs, their powerful film industry seems to wake from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy complete with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern "Hollywood" production minus the garbage that appears to be attached to the genre over the past year. Great soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague cityscape, just to name a few. The story actually consists of several sub-stories that often coincide and overlap. One is essentially a collage of destiny, destiny, desires ... It follows a group of urban youths to the mid-thirties through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to career and obsessions. And it is hillarious. There is actually a point in the movie where the entire theater I was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) grinned non-stop for about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience it with modern Hollywood productions? Although the main role is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonian star Labina Mitevska in the role of an immigrant to the all too familiar hardships), Jiri Machacek has to hand out his excellent credible portrayal of Jakub, a constantly stoned bohemian whose brains are hard hit Of the things he smokes, he lands in an abundance of fun situations. Conclusion: Don't miss this one! It has a lot to offer.
