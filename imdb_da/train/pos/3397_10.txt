Soylent Green IS ... a really good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I would never have believed it. I really don't like Heston in his sci-fi action. He is one of the actors who, as Superman, manages to get across all snow and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And he also cheats through much of Soylent Green, but since he is supposed to play a convincing bully, I can't really think. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people would turn their nose up on this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic images (what do you know - it just looks like 1973) and it is lacking in action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and heavily layered society, and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving, fun final role. Beautiful little character moments - like sharing some valuable food with Heston - really make the movie. Soylent Green's message is quite relevant these days when no one seems to know what the hell government or businesses are up to. Funny, isn't it to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie ...
