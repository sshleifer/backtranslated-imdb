I think you should be from the United States to get a lot of jokes. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you'd like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the movie to them of course, but having the camera trip was obviously done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes are one hundred times better than nepolean dynamics. Just my opinion. I'm sure people from France won't appreciate French caricatures. So this movie is not for a world audience. And although I'm not a film critic, I know what I like. I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws got hurt at the end of the movie.
