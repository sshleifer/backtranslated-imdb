One of the pleasures of bringing together the latest Bela Lugosi collection is to watch great movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi join together in a movie that kills meteorites and radiation, and while science is completely absurd (especially the Karloff camera technique, which Janos Rukh uses to determine the location of a particular meteorite) and even ridiculous, I don't care the lease because the film is thoroughly enjoyable. The effects are good for the time being, the play is great and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of pulp sci-fi comics and novels from the 1940s and '50s, complete with jet guns and ridiculous science. You have to watch this movie!
