A wonderful, fluid, often lyrical movie that whispers you, ever smiles, though there are really shocking events along the way. A gasps in the way women are treated and yet they seem to get through very well, and it is very important for everyone worried that so many potentially catastrophic scenes all work so well. This may be Depardieu's best performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs excellently in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including powerful sex scenes with a few guys at least half of their age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. This initially appears to be a down and dirty misogynistic ridge / trunk, but as the narrative and characters unfold a much more tender and honest image emerges. Eventually, this uncompromising and bold film requires respect.
