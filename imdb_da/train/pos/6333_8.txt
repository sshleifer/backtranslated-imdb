I just got this video used and I saw it last night. The action started extremely poorly (hey ------ hi ------ twister) but was very good short by departments. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very risky, but the scene with the house blew apart and the content inside was blown and sucked out was extremely well done and almost on a par with Twister's movie. The scenes of destruction were also extremely well done. The story was very well-written, and it is refreshing to see a movie like this removed from the same old "disaster formulas". Movies of this genre seem to have stuck in for 30 years. <br /> <br /> While this movie had a very strange mix of FX and working quality, this deserves an A in my book.
