I had the pleasure of watching this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would like to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget for this movie, I'm very eager to see what she can do with a big picture. Kudos tossed for their amazing performances (the little girl was gold) and to the one who composed the music. The choked "Row Your Boat" blew me away. Very creative movie around .... I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because I would buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely watch this movie.
