Sammi, Curr a metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, it tried to censor his music !! (Like the real life Dee Snider, from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) killed in a fire, Sammi Cure had to play on Halloween at his old gym for a dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how Sammi was and what he felt (or did he?) Nuke, Dj at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives the only copy of Sammi's last record Eddie .. But when Eddie tries to playing the record behind, he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do to get back on the bad guys at his school that hates him and his music. Everything goes out until Sammi starts to kill !! A great movie and should look for heavy metal hairband fans with a good soundtrack of Fastway, and just if you don't know what the songs sound like or know Fastway and don't like them, they changed that voice a bit and looks like sound too Like the more famous Cinderella or Rat .. Is the movie a real horror movie? It depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror movie is a slasher, with lots of killings or simply scary. This movie is not enough death, but it cannot be called an act, comedy, drama, excitement or thriller, so that's why I would guess it should be a horror. So if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' in the middle of the night, steel your soul !!" But Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
