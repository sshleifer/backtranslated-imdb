Well, first of all I would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated it means "to protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> Also, the Tamil film industry is quite full of purely commercial ventures. Any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie would be the will of that statement. <br /> <br /> Now, Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT movie with a good soundtrack. Certainly very amazing in the final scene, especially love the end (which is certainly unexpected!). Gore is pretty much too much at times, but it's definitely a great movie!
