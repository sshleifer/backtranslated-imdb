CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure to see on so many reasons. The action of Clara Lago is simply fantastic for anyone so young, and she is one of the special actors who can say much with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film without a break in continuity, thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough excitement to keep a wonder what the nest scene will bring. The manuscript of Angel Garcia Roldan is the story of history at best, which apparently is the greatest purpose for movies after all. The reason is unpredictable, but the events such as the races are quite logical. Perhaps the best feature of this movie is to tell a story of the Spanish Civil War when it hit the people. It was a great event in the 20th century, but almost no Americans know it. In fact, in 40 years of college education, I was average on a student a semester that had even heard of it, much less who could say anything comprehensive about it - and the overwhelming number of students were profit researchers who all speak to the vast amount of censorship in American education. So in a way, this movie is a good way to start an investigation of that event, remembering that when a thread is pulled, much of the story is lifted. The rewriting of this film is therefore directly related to the amount of one's knowledge. To watch this movie as another upcoming age movie, the missing movie is completely. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of cinematic, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and artistry - on a scale of 10 to very good, 5 on average and 1 for need of help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above the average of all counts, except the average rated. The LEI average for this movie is 9.3, raised to a 10 when equal to the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
