An excellent cast makes this movie work; All the characters have been developed extremely well, and it is clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie. It's not quite the comedy I had expected, much more a light-haired look at the attempt to regain youthful glory than bawdy humor. For music fans, there are quite a few subtle references, which in themselves are intelligent fun. <br /> <br /> I hate to draw direct comparisons with other movies, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker movies, I can't help it: imagine whether the commitments actually made it big - and tried then resume the glory 25 years later.
