This amazing documentary gives us an insight into the lives of the brave women in Cameroon's justice system - police officers, lawyers and judges. Despite enormous difficulties - lack of funds, people's desperate poverty, more languages ​​and more legal precedents, depending on the country's region and the religious / ethnic background of the defendants and defendants - these brave strong women make a difference. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspirational movie that restores a little bit of faith in humanity. Despite the horrors we see in the film, justice is served thanks to these passionate, hard-working women. I just hope this movie gets a great release in the US. The more people watching this movie, the better.
