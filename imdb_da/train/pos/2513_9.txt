Beautifully done. Very anxious. Friendship must not endure all, but in the end it is all that matters or a group of friends learn. I've seen it over and over again. The music is also fantastic. When Kei loses the one friend he has, he gives up until he meets Sho, an orphan who is not rejected by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa, they fight for their own place among a melting pot of Asian races and learn that sometimes being on the top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay. A surprise stops grabbing as much as the whole movie does. I couldn't get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde do a wonderful job of acting and proving that they are more than beautiful boys singing.
