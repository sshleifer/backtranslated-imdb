Jodie Foster, Cherie Currie (the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group Runaways in her remarkably performing debut), Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are uniformly credible, handsome and touching as the titles quartet that is tight-knit clips of troubled fiercely loyal young girls with negligent, eerie, self-centered parents who do their best to grow up and cope with the wealthy San Fernando Valley, California suburbs. The girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex, drugs, alcohol, commitment, and so on in a young age when they are not fully prepared to fully comply with the potentially harmful consequences of those decisions. Foster, giving one of her most notable, influencing and undervalued beliefs to date, is basically the group's mother who commits herself and the others; She is particularly concerned about the kindhearted but ruthless and self-defeating Currie whose carelessness hedonistic lifestyle probably makes her an unnecessary end. <br /> <br /> This image provides an exciting, insightful, often devastating, credible and thoroughly absorbent study of broken, dysfunctional families that exist directly under the suburbia's nicely manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families: hard, elastic, but unhappy and vulnerable children who must confront the attempt to grow on their own because their parents are either too reckless or even non-existent. Adrian ("Fatal Attraction", "Jacob's Ladder") Lyne's direction is both robust and attentive, while Gerald Ayres's script is somewhat messy and wandering, but in general, nevertheless, precisely in his frank, gritty, unentimental depiction of your average latchkey child's nerve-racking chaotic , moody and unpredictable everyday. Leon Bijou's soft, virtuous, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily destructive sense of calm and innocence. Giorgio Moroder arranged the excellent score, which makes particularly effective use of Donna Summers elegant "On the Radio". The top-notch cast includes Sally Kellerman as Foster's neurotic, insecure, nice mother, Scott Baio as a cute skateboarder guy, Randy Quaid as Kagan's rich older girlfriend, British 60s pop singer Adam Faith as Foster's feckless, absent rock promoter father and Lois Smed as kagan slings, overprotective mother's appearance in short pieces is Robert Romanus (Mike Damone "Fast Times at Richmont High") as one of Foster's morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing Laura Dern as an unpleasant party crash. Achingly authentic, exciting and deeply moving (Currie's eerie ultimate fate is very heartbreaking), "Foxes" is simply one of the most unsung and underdated teen films made about the early 80s youth.
