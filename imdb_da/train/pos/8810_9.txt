I first saw this movie as it aired on the now interrupted trio channel a few years ago, and recently saw it again - sans commercials - at Sundance. I was impressed for the first time and found it even more engaging in other viewing. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out as a tender thumb - but overall, 11 09 01 is a complete success. Best show: Shohei Imamura's amazing last segment, which modern critics like the thick-woven Mick LaSalle somehow interpreted as an attack on the 'terrorists', but now is revealed as a polemic masterful anti-war; Samira Makhmalbaf's opening piece, which manages to blend deep empathy with the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for Afghanistan's children; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's entertaining children's crusade to Osama Bin Laden - a hunt just as serious and managed a business like that of the real Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble, erroneous experiment that at least has the courage to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically American foreign and CIA creations, and while Sean Penn's character study is out of place, it is still an effective bittersweet piece of film making. All in all, substantial viewing and a darn view better than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.
