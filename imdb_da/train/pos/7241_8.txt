Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual who lives as a servant in "Grand Slam", directed by William Dieterle (1933). It is a surprisingly fun satire of celebrity building. The waiter and the Russian restaurant hat-check girl, played by Loretta Young, become America's lovers as bridge partners who do nothing. With the help of publisher and ghost writer 'Speed' McCann (the wonderfully killed Frank McHugh), they become water advertising <br /> <br /> for the "Stanislavsky system", a "system" to bid on what one feels <br / > <br /> (since bids are not rational, there is no basis for accusations of their stupidity). A duel with displaced broguru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, no? And I suppose the choice of character's name "Stanislavsky" was also a slam on another kind of system), played a puffed-up charlatan very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk , broadcast on radio stations throughout America as a prize match by Roscoe Karns (another great fast-paced deadpan comic actor of the 1930s). The bridge players are even in a roped-off square, even though the audience is <br /> <br /> over them, as opposed to boxing "rings." <br /> <br /> The vast selection of American types prefers the Comedies of Preston Sturges, but for the celebrity production, "Grand Slam" most call for two better films from the same (pre-code) era with Lee Tracy who Plays fast speakers: "The Half Naked Truth" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has its <br /> <br /> moments, especially for anyone who has the game bridge with serious point counters. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clotheshorse. (For me, her face seems a bit long <br /> <br /> and also the horse. Another era is the notion of beauty, I think ...) The movie <br /> <br /> unfortunately all but slides Glenda Farrell playing McHugh's forgetful <br /> <br /> boyfriend.
