This time Bill and Ted will travel through the afterlife 'Totally Bogus' and save humanity 'Excellent' <br /> <br /> With much of the same zany humor and some amazing new characters like the ugly reaper, station and robot Bill and Ted ( Station Creation) Once again, Bogus Journey enjoys watching for his soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> A most triumphant sequel <br /> <br /> Party on Dudes! hehe
