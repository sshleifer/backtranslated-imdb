This film is described as a comedy, but there was no comedy at all. Like any Panahi movie, it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very fun; much easier than the director's dark and serious The Circle (my favorite Iranian movie). The credibility of the girls and the banners between them and the soldiers were both completely credible (as if it were a documentary) and quite fun. <br /> <br /> The recording of the actual battle and deepening was amazing. It added a realism like Australia's Kenny, of course, a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? was very trustworthy. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who believes that Muslim girls wearing a chador are different from their own daughters, should they watch this movie? It will be a real eye-opener. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the present paradigm. They started with standard official political reactions on all the girls' grounds. As the film progressed, they found it increasingly difficult to maintain this position. When it seems that all Tehran breaks into wild celebration, everyone is caught in it, and current politics is ridiculous for everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected ending, and gave the film a really nice mix of emotions, passion, drama and social comments. Although it is an adult cinema, I think mature children from about seven and above will really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). It is noteworthy that a repressive country like Iran is capable of producing films of such quality by people like Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the limitations here are forcing them to be extremely resourceful. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a leaf out of their book.
