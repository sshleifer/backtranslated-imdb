In addition to the fact that it is awesomeness at all, this movie has surpassed all my expectations, this masterpiece of movie history portrait overuse of crappy filters in the best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brother conflict with everything there is to it. As usual, a woman gives her true intentions. The end came as surprisingly as irresponsible as killing Keith Scott of his older brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes of 'wiking land' are like I remember from my early travels. - To be honest, my strong passion for trash film is one of the ways I have in my never-ending collection. I recommend this movie to all the people who are in love with the most amazing brother thrown from One Tree Hill. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
