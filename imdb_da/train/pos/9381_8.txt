A driver seeking a job is wrong for a hit man in a small Wyoming city that leads to all kinds of complications. Cage is perfectly thrown as the unfortunate schmuck hopes to make a quick buck and get out of town but find he can't escape the title city. Hopper does what he does best, plays a psycho known as "Lyle from Dallas", the real hitman. Walsh as a curly sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatal round out the fine cast. The writings of the brothers John and Rick Dahl contain delicious twists, and John's direction creates a wonderful "neo noir" atmosphere. Witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer from the start and never lets up.
