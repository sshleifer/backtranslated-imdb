This film is not a scam, despite the lo fi production and its link to Troma productions. A dark fable for adults. Exploitation is a theme for Sugar Cookies, and one wonders if the casting has not been changed to the theme. A strange movie with enticing pictures: shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth seeing, especially from fans of Warhol and stylish decadence. Through all cruelty and evil, a moral, albeit twisted, can be shone.
