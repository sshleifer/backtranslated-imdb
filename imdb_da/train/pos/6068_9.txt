Red Skelton was still another big star that surpassed the transition from film to television. <br /> <br /> He certainly showed a laugh to American households for years. <br /> <br /> He would start the show with an opening monologue. Afterwards we would have a number of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember an episode where as a King Red introduced his queen by referring to her as your obesity. <br /> <br /> You know that Red would use his comic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so. His wife, Georgia, died of suicide.
