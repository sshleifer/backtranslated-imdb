Sudden consequences were generally better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was becoming a great movie, but then I saw the villain (s) and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Suddenly Impact was different from the previous rates. The reason went a different direction in this movie when Dirty Harry didn't take as much of a police method this time. We also can't see the villain (s) for later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood again stole the show as Dirty Harry, probably said. Pat Hingle was fun as Chief Janning's, Harry's new assigned boss. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here, somehow he was no different. Michael Currie is decent as Lt. Donnelly, Harry's annoying superior. I personally enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace, Harry's mate. Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian in town. Jack Thibeau was well-cast as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-term partner was terribly displeased as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just awful like Mick. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
