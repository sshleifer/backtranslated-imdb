So your bairns are gone to sleep? Wife visiting mother-in-law? You are at home though. It's a dark and stormy night, and there's no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking? So now what should you do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Join an old-fashioned cocoa (Freeze is best!) Get some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the DVD. Now choose and play Arthur Aceys World War Two thriller / horror Ghost Train, return to the comfortable sofa and enjoy the night! Ghost Train is a true British time warrior classic! Arthur Askey with his side scoop, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you, and I suppose thrown into a high-octane, excitement and waste, spying thriller. It is set in the old rural England in World War II. <br /> <br /> It is centered around a disgusting group of people who have to stay overnight, in circumstances beyond their control, in an old railway room that they discover is haunted by an old train. <br /> <br /> The reason unfolds nicely and precisely and is a credit to the whole cast, it's humorous in parts and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by the old boy Godfrey of Dads Army fame and it is wise) Arthur Askey is entertaining and is very much at home preforming his routines to you and throwing, he also shows that he can act little! The cast is never out, even though the railroad rider and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravity. <br /> <br /> Oh, and when it ends, remember to stack the dishwasher!
