It took us a few episodes to "come in" Dark Angel as a story and series, since we passed from The Sopranos, a completely different mentality frame. But when we first came up with the series in the series we were very quickly connected. It's a shame that the series ended when it just started to go well into the excellent category: Dark Angelwas much more than your average TV series. It kicks ass and rock as far as action goes, but the interplay between the signs and societal reactions to "mutants" reminds us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. That the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces (thus not ruining "fun" for those who do not like being lectured during entertainment), but each event and human / social interaction remains relevant for the present. We all judge, face our own prejudices, but ultimately the question of who you are in is: Are you linking yourself back and sticking to it, or are you standing up and doing something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice, this series gives them. For those who have never had to face the issue, this series "cheats" this message under cover of pure action entertainment. It is much more well-made and well-written than most TV shows; I'm very disappointed it ended up before it could really kick in high gear.
