"I moved out here to get away from this sort of thing!" The small town of Sheriff laments. <br /> <br /> "This happens a lot in Chicago?" His substitute asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The reason is that a group of martyrs fails a Halloween Rebroadcast of Orson Welles' World of War as an account of a true Martian invasion, and concludes that they need to get in on the action! The following is a lot of disadvantages involving Martian's random attempt to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone concludes that they are children in really good costumes, except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend, a child in a duck suit. The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression that they are no threat to anyone but them quite early. It's a fun family movie.
