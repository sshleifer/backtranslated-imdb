As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I've just seen the musical this week. This made it possible for me to judge the movie without the hassle of what was or was not in the musical (it shot me, however, when I saw the music :)) I actually think Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role with Kasey. I think she "let me dance for your scene" is one of the best parts of the movie, a valuable addition to musical. The dancers and song in the film are far better than the music, as well as the casting, which is at least 10 times larger (easier to do in the film of course). The decorations, lighting, dance and song are also much better in the film, as one should expect and actually delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were shared with the music are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good, and the whole movie only delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially in relation to a musical who has get decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors who talked and dubbed singers under the song parts for some of the characters, but their dance is impeccable and the end product was more fun than the musical
