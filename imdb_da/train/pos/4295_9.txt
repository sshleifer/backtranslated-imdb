Alain Chabat claims this movie as its original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is just as old if it's not older than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is a "vieux garcon", happily single and does not want a member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - G7 - who decides to be married. Enter the lovely, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte has to pose as Chabat's boyfriend and then simply does not show up on the wedding day. No more talking about marriage from G7. Of course, the best possible plans tend to germinate without control. <br /> <br /> There are very strong supporting roles from Lafont as mother and Osterman as the tight brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> There are some amazing scenes that first Charlotte has to charm, so rebel the family. French farce with English.
