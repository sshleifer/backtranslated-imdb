Simon Pegg plays a rude raw and often out of control celebrity journalist brought from England to work for a large American magazine. Of course, his winning ways create all kinds of complications. Entertaining fact-based comedy, co stars Kristen Dunst (looks quite adult), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It seems primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We clearly understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screws. I liked the movie. It's not all and ends everything, but it was a good way to close an evening sitting on the couch and watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
