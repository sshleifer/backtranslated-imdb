I have read a comment describing this movie "trash can" and "waste <br /> <br /> of the time." I think this person got their political undies beaten a little <br /> <br /> too much. <br /> <br /> I just rented the new Criterion DVDs from both Yellow and Blue. <br /> <br /> These films - although not large - have at least been of historical interest to the so-called "radical student" of the late "political-social movement" of the late '60s. <br /> <br /> I had seen no picture and from their notorious reputation, I had expected a real porn (there is no.) There is frontal <nudity (including the still verboten frontal male nudity (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - Orwellian-X) in the US But I didn't expect the movies <br / <br /> <br /> Although it tends to be simplistic, I thought it sometimes made its points well, both movies had sometimes I laughed out loud <br /> <br /> and the director's comment made it clear that there was plenty of <br /> <br /> parody in the movie. br /> <br /> scenes The first such scene is very realistic, the main game is lumpy, unlucky, fun and loving in their first collection scene. <br /> <br /> The other - which caused most complaints - is fake <br /> <br /> Cunnilingus and fellatio, and the last is the end of an angry battle, <br /> <br /> it is credible. <br /> <br /> The extras include an informative introdu movie for the film, an <br /> <br /> interview with the original US distributor and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> Sample testimony in the United States and a "diary" comment <br /> <br / > by the director on some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that "blue nose" would not be left alone and led to the <br /> <br /> pivotal "prurient interest without social redemption value" standard <br /> < br /> that, fortunately, it still stands. <br /> <br /> Those interested in history quirks will find this a must <br /> <br /> see.
