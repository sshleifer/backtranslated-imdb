I liked this movie, even though I was halfway through to tell who the secret admirer was. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it was based on a true story since it told about the "real" people at the end of the movie. I think I need to investigate and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember what condition this happened in? I think they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, states could have been changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You'd think this man could have counted it as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
