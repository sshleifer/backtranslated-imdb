Spoiler !!! This movie is based on the concept of What if? Of course, Mr Destiny will be able to answer this question. The protagonist goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos Theory indicates a butterfly in China could have an effect on someone from a chain reaction. The focus of this movie is based on an event during a baseball game. This event moves its fate; Like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect" except Mr. Destiny uses comedy over drama. The results make a fresh, slightly original film. If one's philosophical is consistent with "The Butterfly Effect," one will probably enjoy Mr. Destiny. I give it a 7 out of 10. Great, because I've seen the first half of this movie 3 times, and finally saw the end of TBS.
