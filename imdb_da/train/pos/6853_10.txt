Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mysterious horror movie from Brian De Palma, and it really works. The atmosphere is right there. The atmosphere that makes you scared. And that's not what a horror movie has to do. All the actors are in the right places. Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott shrinks with a little secret. Angelie Dickinson as Kate Miller, the sexually frustrated mature woman is amazing. Kedith Gordon as his son Peter is brilliant. Nancy Allen as the Liz Blake call girl is amazing. Dennis Franz does his typical detective role. His Detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this movie. There are lots of scary scenes in this movie. Elevator scene is one of them. Comparisons have been made between this and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Both of these movies can provide some sleepless nights.
