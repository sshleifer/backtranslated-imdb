Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There is a set of moral dilemmas that face. Man has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is humanity mature enough to handle its new toys? There is moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill for attention. I predict (based on the BSG background) that there will be a problem with Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are all the other problems that we humans bring to ourselves. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least not as far as humanity is fleeing from a ruthless problem that was ultimately their own creation. Also, there are not many shoot-em-up or space-based special effects - at least not in the first few episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> What it has is very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performances from the actors. They can create a culture that resembles modern society, but at the same time the alien is completely credible. Like BSG, this notion is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potential and errors. It may seem a little strange that a human society on another set of worlds has tie, antique cars and chicken. But these things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone who sticks to these details really lacks the point. Whether you are from a mafia-style culture or a wealthy and high-tech culture, people and people, it is not so different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than we see in the world today. Wonder if the authors are trying to tell us something.
