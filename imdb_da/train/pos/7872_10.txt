The first review I looked at said, "What's madhur bhandarkar finally willing to say?". He must say something so crucial. <br /> <br /> The best thing about page 3 is that it doesn't take pages. No propaganda at all. This is the movie that captures so many angles of a problem (I don't know what I call as a "problem" here) and yet like any mediocre movie, a solution doesn't come up. I was so fascinated when I realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario as it did. <br /> <br /> The movie defines so many characters that are completely different priorities and different ideologies, and yet they are all part of the system that is all the more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers ahead. So look to see one of the most mature movies of recent times.
