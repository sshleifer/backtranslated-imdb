I rented this to my son who recently was interested in 9/11. He was a kindergarten at that time and had no idea what unfolded. I liked the way it was told as a "documentary." If there was a movie I would recommend to see about 9/11, it would be the one! Usually you see a movie, it has actors who are well-known. This movie had no one known. You also see a movie about 9/11, you hear about a firefighter or two who lose their lives and save people. I didn't feel it had any of it! I only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done indeed! My heart goes to survivors and families to victims of 9/11!
