Every time Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a movie like "The Golden Child", especially. This is a movie you would count on star might be Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or anyone. But Eddie really does work; he is smart, he is fun, he is brave, kind, polite, frugal, clean and everything else a hero must be. <br /> <br /> Having been chosen to secure a mysterious child who has the key to protecting the world from complete Eddie goes from California to Nepal and back, while beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he is all he says he is and a crazy old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) knows he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and of course fun. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start a movie by making rude comments behind a guy reading a porn magazine and ending it with clever comments about Ed McMahon. No problem with this "Child": It's a "Golden" find. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
