Just downloaded this on DVD and saw it again. I love the bright colors vs. dark images. Not a great Beatty fan, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and well, this movie marked the period when Madonna was her absolute sexiest. I wish she had stuck in "Breathless" for a while longer. Charlie Korsmo's first really great role, except for "What about bob?" The makeup effects were groundbreaking then and still keeping up for the most part. Beautiful landscape and mood transport you directly into a cartoon environment. The cars, wardrobe, buildings and even streetlights and a good tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with very red can get a little annoying as it tends to blur. Just want Beatty had the chance to make a sequel. All in all, a fun couple of hours.
