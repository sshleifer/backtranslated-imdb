Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and I can almost remember the number you might call to actually rent the movie at your t.v. As a kid, we always wanted to rent the playboy, but it actually meant calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the nerves to do it, and you see four hours of soft core, no angular pan. Well the reason I bring it up is because this film was also on ppv. And I remember almost all the scenes that were in the addition. I have been on a kick for the past few years to get all the amazing movies I use to look like a kid and that was one of them. It is one that is difficult to shut down. All star cast tries to make the perfect bank bust, but nothing goes right. There are plenty of spoof bank hijackers who are good and this should fall into that category. It has enough action and laughs to maintain it. check it out if you dare!
