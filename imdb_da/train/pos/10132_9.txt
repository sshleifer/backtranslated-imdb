In this first episode of Friends, we are introduced to the six main characters in the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discover that Rachel, a wealthy girl who is Monica's high school friend, left her fiance, Barry, at the altar when she discovered she didn't love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father and get new work as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife is a lesbian and lost her to Susan, her partner. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, prepares (and eventually sleeps) with the Paul "wine" who gave her the excuse to be impotent since he divorced his wife. But in reality, he just deceives her. Ps: I just loooove Joey and Chandler's haircuts in this first season! =)
