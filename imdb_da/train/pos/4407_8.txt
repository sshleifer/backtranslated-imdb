For those who commented on Patriot as being accurate (who basically satanized the English), it was interesting to watch this movie. Of all accounts, this was the bloodiest war that Americans have ever been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from the side of the Atlantic that does not paint America as either martyrs or saviors. All in all, even though what this film brought home was the true horror of any conflict and how whatever action is being taken in war, only acts worse, often culminating in the innocent suffering. This was not a movie where you cheered someone on, but both pitied and abhorred everyone.
