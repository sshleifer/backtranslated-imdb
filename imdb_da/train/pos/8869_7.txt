In this little movie we have some beautiful figures, but a very low plot. It's really nice to see because Singleton does a great job of presenting the esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the viewer forget about the non-existent realism that this movie supposedly exists. In fact, what we have here is all possible clich√©s and stereotypes put on celluloid at a higher rate than a soap. Definitely not a deep movie (though it will be) but better than an average college movie.
