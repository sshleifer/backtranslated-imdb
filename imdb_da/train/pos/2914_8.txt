Not many films were made about the Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) aspect of aviation, but this is one of them and it is wrong well. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place on Navy blimp operations on NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays a sympathetic but Munchausen-like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet, an enlisted pilot whose high stories have been so frequent that no one really believes in him. Half of the fun is near the end of the movie when the events begin to prove that most of his more outlandish stories are actually true. <br /> <br /> Seen during World War II, the main plot around the bachelor trumpet puts only a local widow to end up having a father-son relationship with the widowed son, jess. Told that he would never go without crutches of doctors, Chief Trumpet pulls some strings and a naval surgeon helps restore the boy's curly legs. Jess continues to join the Navy to become a flight officer who flies back into Lakehurst and faces a whole new set of challenges. A very well-designed film, though not without any Hollywood dialogue past the technical advisers, and Bey's apparent inability to march in steps. Otherwise, this movie gets good marks for technical accuracy and gives a rare look at Navy's LTA operations. The Cash Register Scene, an exchange between trumpet and Jess's future love interest Cathy, is an absolute hoot.
