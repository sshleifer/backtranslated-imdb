This is an honest attempt to make an enchanting sweet love story. the obvious inspiration behind the successful television series "Bewitched", this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. the comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays a rude but stole "straight." Kim Novac plays a rich blonde witch who catches him through the use of a love roll. But when the syllable is broken by a stronger witch, she keeps herself in the task of running her own shop and takes comfort in her beloved aunt caring for her beloved pyewacket. you will recognize the aunt from "Murder at death." This movie is fun and calming sweet and carries some spectacular whites and a nice witchy feeling. worth a visit.
