Sharp, well-documented documentary with a focus on Mardi Gras pearls. I always want this approach to filmmaking - conveying ideas of a larger, more complex and often impenetrable phenomenon by breaking the question into something known and close to home. <br /> <br /> I am sure most people have heard stories of sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and the effect of globalization on poorer countries (but people feel about it). Instead of commenting on these issues and coming up with a soap box (not that there is anything wrong with it, in addition to such documentaries typically proclaiming the converted), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras pearls, how they are produced by which people and under what conditions and how they are exploited by consumers at the end of the process. It clearly and motivated the motivation of all involved in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers, and finally the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little sick of this; also by the Mardi Gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and ready for the course (though they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). The street sweeper's recordings clear the beads out of the streets at the end, giving a special impression. But it was just my reaction; I can see how someone else can read this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Contrary to other documentaries on this subject, I do not think that you should have any specific political opinion affected by this. This is ultimately a story about people and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever purchased a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Excellent and highly recommended. Need to see more documentaries like this. Kudos to all those involved in the production of this movie.
