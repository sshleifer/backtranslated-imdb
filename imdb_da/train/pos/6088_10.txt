Was the script more appropriate for a 30 minute sitcom? Yes, but they still work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise boring script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the table really seem to hate this movie. I can't personally see how it could be, but Envy is just one of those movies that you either love or hate. Much like Napoleon Dynamite and any Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. You either think it is one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. Avoid avoiding this movie because of the reviews. See it and see if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee it's worth your money. If you don't like it ... Well, now you know.
