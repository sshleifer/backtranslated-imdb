It's hard to judge movies like this because you consider it on production or just fun? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie back in about 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I'm sorry it started a lifelong fascination with ninjas. The plot is pretty gloomy and the play is of course terrible, but there is some mystery about the ninjas in this movie, which gives a good atmosphere. What is important is the battle scenes, while a "small" sparce is really good. <br /> <br /> I must say that it was better when I was a boy, only now can I see the sharp points of incredible gambling in the movie, but as a "sit back with a few beers" martial arts Movie I can't fault it, it delivers and is much better than the mountains of "American Ninja" Style Waste that was churned out in the 80s with hundreds of guys in black suits, but really not very good fighting scenes. In an interesting tone, Dusty Nelson, the author and director of Sakura Killers, made another ninja movie under the Bonaire movie flag called "White Phantom" I have no idea this was supposed to be a sequel to Sakura Killers ", but Sakura The clan is again a major feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time, including a white ninja, this too, while mostly gloomy, had a small sense of atmosphere, but the battle scenes are even more sparse and to be honest , is pretty awful. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a martial arts fan, give it a shot to kill a few hours!
