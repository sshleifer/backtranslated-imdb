Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" comment on a reviewer made regarding Elisha Cook's obvious coke-fueled drum series episode. This was a doozy, I have to say. Cook deserved some recognition for his incredible performance. A little trivia that I convince: The cook appeared as a serving in Barbara Stanwyck's 1941 movie, "Fire of Fire". He was a servant in the nightclub, where Barbara sang and legendary drummer Gene Krupa drummed most energetically. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's spazzy drum in the later film "Phantom Lady" was greatly inspired by Krupa's work, which Cook knew 3 years earlier Cook? <br /> <br /> If you see Krupa in the "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice the movements of some clearly similar bodies. Of course, one hopes that he was not affected by any medication at that time!
