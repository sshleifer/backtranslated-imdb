This is one of the movies they did too much for. If you see T.V., then you might as well not see the movie. Almost all the fun scenes are pampered in the previews, except one that just happens to be Jennifer Annisten who is the fun. It's typical Jim Carrey's humor and it's really fun. Just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies, this is a must-see, or just watch the previews and you'll be just as happy.
