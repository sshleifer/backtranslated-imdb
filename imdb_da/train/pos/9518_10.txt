An excellent portrayal of one of the more unhealthy aspects of the era. I loved the visuals - very appropriate for a story associated with a graphic novel. I thought Tom Hanks was really good at this, he came up very well as someone who has been hardened by his work (which he doesn't fully choose for himself) but still wants a normal life for his family. He does the best he can to see that happens. Don't want to ruin the plot - but you should watch this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot'em up action / gangster format. (However, it is violent.)
