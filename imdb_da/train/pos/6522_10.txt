Throughout the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures, the ball really fell to restore this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B. DeMille watched movie and get it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and unaware that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault on a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, who would have helped make the Crescent City Once again famous for it's Pirate Connections. When Execs at Paramount finally comes with the program and releases this movie in digital format, I will be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures it's up to you to get out of your duff and get this movie restored now!
