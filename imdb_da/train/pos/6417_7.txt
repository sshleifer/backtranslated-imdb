The inspirational story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, hoping to be the first black master diver in Navy history. We show the battle's battle situation, which Brashear must overcome to make his dream come true (and then keep it alive.) Not least the challenges were Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), head coach at the Navy Diving School sending Brashear, who is not special sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but ultimately becoming an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; fast pace and with a lot of action, even though it is not an "action" image in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very human story here and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; There is also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old navy" against "the new fleet.") The performance is quite good - especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro might be a bit over the top in his depiction of Sunday (though, who knows Sunday might have been this extreme kind of loose cannon) and the depiction of Sunday's wife Gwen (by Charlize Theron) also made me ask about These parts were "jazzed up" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though. I never once wondered if it was worth tune in. <br /> <br /> 7/10
