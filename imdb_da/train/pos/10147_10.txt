Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede aka, Fitzpatrick on the go, should it be you? He talked to Charlie and Annna in the church when they left? If not, I have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my one true love (my Soulmate), and even though I had the experience of meeting him when I least expected it, I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Although we were married, I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I got complacency and took his love for granted and he resisted it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, he went with anger, but we are still angry and angry and in disbelief about the way it appeared. I had some very difficult lessons to learn, and we have now been separated for 3 years. <br /> <br /> This movie meant a lot because I'm still waiting to unite with my one and only true love. I can now appreciate that the distinct feeling inside me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick was right for me. <br /> <br /> I know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will get married again. <br /> <br /> NEVER DO COMPLACENT AND LOVE LOVE! IT HAS BEEN THE HIGHEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is also outstanding and meaningful! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it is supposed to be, no matter what, it will! Nothing is impossible even when it is the second time! Thanks!
