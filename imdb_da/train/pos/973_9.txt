Wow! So funny! Probably a bit for normal American kids, and it's really a stretch to call this a children's movie. This movie reminded me of part of Time Bandits - very much Terry Gilliam throughout. While the overall narrative is quite straight forward, Miike still throws a lot of surreal and Bunuel-esquire moments. The whole of the first act comes violently from stage to stage to the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the spirit world and the evil that follows. And while the end has suffered from an ambiguous aspect common to Miike's work, the laws of mind and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-revenge announcement of human stupidity, are quite astounding. As a manic and imaginative fun as other fantastic Miike movies, he only gives us an endless amount of Japanese folk music and yokai, creatively conceived through CG and doll wrapped in an imaginatively multi-faceted adventure. No row, and one of Miike's best!
