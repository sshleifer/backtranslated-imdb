Elmer Fudd laughs while lounging in his armchair and reading his cartoon, his dog sleeping comfortably in front of the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a flea jumps past. (The runner is dressed in a farmer-type outfit with a large sombrero and wears a satchel named "A. Flea" on it.) He comes out of his telescope and jumps the dog. (We see a big shot of the dog's ass and flea flutes in excitement, screaming "T-Bone!" He then saw: "There is food around the corner, there is food around the corner!) <br /> <br / > The story of this sweet, but unpleasant flea, which plagues the poor dog, is set up ... Mutt is fun when he reacts to the race. <br /> <br /> The drawings of his big teeth are fighting right next to the whistling flea is clever, and the dog's dialogue made me laugh loudly a couple of times.This may be the funniest dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! The poor pooch, under a threat of having to take a bath, not to react when it Stupid fleas cause him pain, it is almost painful to see, as the race uses pickaxes, jack hammer and the like on the dog, he puts firecrackers in the dog's back.
