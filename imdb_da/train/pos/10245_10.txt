it was a personal favorite for me when i was young, it had everything that was good with 90s children movies ... lovable dinosaurs, sweet kids, an eccentric villain and some good songs (and not the typical little mermaid / beauty and the expensive songs, but the ones that are entertaining entertaining)! I ran back into this movie again and I still love it as much as ever! I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie, and I certainly think it should be introduced to younger generations! Excuse me not the most informative, I'm a little bit rush ... just trust me. Anyone who goes against this movie kills their inner child!
