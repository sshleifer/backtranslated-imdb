Nevertheless, this film has never made it to the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video release. My expectations were high but they were in no way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee, there are great plays, an intelligent and exciting plot that you guess right up to the end and great movie recording. Along with unforgettable it is easy to be one of the two best westerners of the 90s. People who expect something along the Mel Gibson line in The Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be disappointed, everyone else who appreciates the above mentioned qualities will have a great time watching it. 9 out of 10
