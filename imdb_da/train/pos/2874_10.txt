Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is being treated cruelly by her evil stepmother and stressist. One day a ball must be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going because her founder and stepister will not let her go. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is off the ball with the warning of returning home at midnight. At the ball she meets the beautiful Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home and leaves one of her glass windows. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince married later, and they happily ever live. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a great box office success and it continues to charm the audience to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including "A Dream is a Wish, Make Your Heart", "So It's Love," and the Big "Bibbidi-Bobbi-Boo", help tell the story. This was my favorite movie growing up and it has not lost its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest DVD release is the best way to appreciate this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio shows, and restored movie printing!
