I must say that this movie is truly amazing and cordial. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not that bad either! It is so sweet to see that Dani falls in love, and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart while being in love with Maureen. but it is even sweeter to see how much he cares about Dani. I must admit, though, I would like him to fall to Dani in the end. It's just so sweet to see her for him, I didn't want her to have her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen took place in this movie. Seeing him die, made me cry for a whole day. I just couldn't believe it. however, never a more affectionate relationship has been shown in a movie than Maureen and Dani. They can really do it through something. I give this movie a 9 because I didn't want the Court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
