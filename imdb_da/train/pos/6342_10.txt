In a word - excellent. This is THE MOVIE. Go see it. Director Ron Howard ... I think the director Ron Howard did a great job as he usually does. An incredible attention to detail, vibrant colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville atmosphere, astonishing selection of costumes. Wait, there's more to it than that - the story is also very good. There is clearly a message to be drawn from the thoughtful viewers. Jim Carrey is first class. He is probably the best Grinch possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is really good. I'm sure she has a good future. The dog is cool. All in all, it is a very high quality Christmas mandate. If you like adventure, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read some other reviews here ... Get a life. It hurts me every time to see people out there, who ... well ... got their hearts two sizes too small.
