I was about thirteen when this movie came out on TV. It's much better in action than most movies ever since. Martin Sheen is excellent and although Nick Nolte has a small role, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain is amazing. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests the water" in his '34 Ford (COOL) along the mountainous highway, it's spectacular! <br /> <br /> The finish is grand. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the low voice it received. I expect that younger generations are more interested in much of the unwanted that comes out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste triggers the masses!
