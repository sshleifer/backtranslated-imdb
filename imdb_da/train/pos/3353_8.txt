This film gives a strong comment to the Italian people of the time. The use of the mirror to enhance the characters' revelations is wonderful, and I cannot mention the beauty and grandeur of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you might ask if the camera is actually there. The man is also depicted in his short role as the fascist Italian who commands his wife and children, but in his own way a loving father. Beginning scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the Italians is incredible and really places the film historically. I loved the movie, and I also agree that it's fun, it's no longer known.
