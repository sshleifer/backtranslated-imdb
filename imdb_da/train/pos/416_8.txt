Plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, who is actually even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role of John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who played Western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, no one I know played it better than her. Though it may not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important thing about Hickok and about the time it takes. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what DeMille is doing here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, selling rifles to the Indians by a major producer to compensate for the losses he would have due to the end of the Civil War, Custer and Little Big Horn, the unpleasant relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious Woman, with Hickok a man who had killed lots, also the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity all this makes 'The Plainsman' a non-conventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short look that already shows what a great actor he should be. Great emphasis was placed on showing the original weapons of that time.
