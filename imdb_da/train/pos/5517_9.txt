Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment that not only tells a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the "biopic" genre. Checkout: Part 2 is the excellent culmination of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This movie offers all the same features from the first, from the extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's brilliant direction without forgetting that it intends to break with the conventional rules from the biopick. That's what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the time. The final message from this movie is perfect and it contains everything we have. I have been told about Che Guervara's life. The only mistake I found at Che: Part 2 is that a few things felt a bit irrelevant. In summary, I give Che: Del Two a very enthusiastic recommendation, because, as the first, it is a brave and fascinating expert who challenges the viewer and leaves us thinking.
