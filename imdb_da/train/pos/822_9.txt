The last film in Lucas' saga is a sumptuous and spectacular look. It is often regarded as the ugly duckling in the original trilogy, but I think it is a notch above episode IV (and just a notch under episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best movie in the 6-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a great entertaining entertaining movie. It's not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to luca's universe. There is a fine financing attached to it all, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. It is also very fun. New characters are introduced, and the old are facing new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, the inner conflict of Luke's (and the Father's) is what gives the saga backbone. Lucas' aggressive imagination is still very clear, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption are strong objects. I'm glad that Lucas eventually dropped the idea of ​​making episodes VII, VIII and IX because this movie is a great bookend for a long, fascinating and captivating story. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style.
