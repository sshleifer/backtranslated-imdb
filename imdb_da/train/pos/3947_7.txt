Based on a true story of how a man before his time - the great 19th century American poet and humanist Walt Whitman - made an important contribution to how Western medicine treats people with mental health problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in treating people with mental health problems, he began to connect with psychiatric workers and patients. Having seen the psychological methods of the times (inhuman and eerie cruel methods), Walt rejected these methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity and urged others to do the same. The story of Walt's interactions with psychiatric workers, patients and citizens is full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
