This is just the best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70's as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian television, and I loved it immediately (I was 14 da). 25 years later I bought it on a video tape, and a few months ago it was finally shown on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this movie 35 years already, and so do all my friends and family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he also loved it immediately (and this is the generation that grew up watching almost only Hollywood movies and not talking or understanding at all!) . What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special? It's hard to say because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is, you can see this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time. I can't remember any other such movie, no matter how many millions it cost or how big the draft was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
