If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to break into the song every twelve minutes - then it's Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this movie and I have to admit that I laughed many times throughout the film. There are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right. This should go down as one of Disney's "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement!
