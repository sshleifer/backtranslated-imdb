Fantastic film, which in theory must be boring, but comes with subtlety and incredible plays that I have long despaired to find. Instead of relying on clich√©s and overly dramatized moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect and it is easy to refer to them as people you could know. The film does not attempt to draw laughs or push an ideal of the audience, but merely show us the possibility of true love in any case. <br /> <br /> I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thoughtful, fun look at love that I think should be an absolutely romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will soften even the hardest heart.
