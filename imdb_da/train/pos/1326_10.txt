I watched this movie at a college movie festival back in the 70s - I've been waiting FOREVER for this movie to come out on video (finally it is out). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed why it hadn't made it video yet. I've been checking out video stores for the past 15 years and waiting for this great movie to come out! It's one of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it's odd that Werner Herzog is weird - its wonder comes from its super-realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a true event back a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first encountered the tribes of the Amazon. A white man fails of a missing tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. Before they send him, however, they make him part of their tribe (their custom). The whole movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That is it. Cosmic plotline? No. Intensive insight into the diversity of human life? Absolutely. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... Be warned ... this movie has certain nudity - this is not a Hollywood schlock flick about noble savages ... this movie tells it as if it was (read above: National Geographic, super realism) <br /> <br />
