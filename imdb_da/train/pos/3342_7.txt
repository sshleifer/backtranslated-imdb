If you enjoy romantic comedies, then you will find this tale of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfactorily. On the other hand, if you're hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you'll probably have to stay away. The plot contains the compulsory guy meets girl's friends, the girl meets the guy's friends, and the guy meets the girl's parenting scenes. There is even a guy meeting the girl's dog scene. It's all for the course in a movie like this. But what I liked about it was that the plot went into the decision making people do when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and actually is a bit quirky. The ground focuses on answering the questions; How much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to drum these things? It is interesting to see the characters work as out because deep down (if we admit it), we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in his role, and Fallon sorta surprised me - he is also good. I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or romantic involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and draw two points if you are a Yankees fan.
