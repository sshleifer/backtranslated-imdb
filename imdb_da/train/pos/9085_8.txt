I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, even though the film was not released in the US, at least until mid-September. Perhaps these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I'm in the US and have just seen it today. I thought special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-western, but I think we are all used to it from many other movies. It was not difficult to follow at all. The action at the wires was weak, but other people were quite good. There was also humor everywhere. I rated it at 8 because I was happy to see it, which is what I was after.
