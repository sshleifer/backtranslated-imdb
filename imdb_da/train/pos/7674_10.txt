I had the privilege of seeing "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a strong and moving story! Holly is a 12 year old Vietnamese girl who is sold for prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) enters Holly's life and decides that he will help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick is desperately looking for her. We follow their difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. Holly is one of millions of children sold and traded every day. The film portrays this difficult problem without crossing the line. I went away and wanted to know more about the issue of child trafficking and ask how can I help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it reveals a problem that we should no longer ignore.
