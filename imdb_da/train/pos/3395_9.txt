This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both watch the same movie. I've talked to many people about the movie, and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women have a lower tolerance for obnoxious or depressing plots - but for whatever reason I have always found this difference fascinating. The movie begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation with Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the great international Soylent Corporation has been murdered. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize that this is a terrible and very invisible future American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments with security and all the pleasures that money can buy (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid mistresses accompanying the apartment). At the same time, the masses are dirty poor, unemployed and in many cases live on abandoned cars or apartments. Overpopulation and smog have taken a serious toll and the future looks awful! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible truth he couldn't live with, I should NOT discuss - it could ruin the movie for you. The film, however, has a great plot and plays and is super exciting to see. Plus, it includes Edward G. Robinson in his last screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Although not slightly depressed or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi movie that is allegorical and deep.
