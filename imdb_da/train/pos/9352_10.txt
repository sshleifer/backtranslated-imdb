Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story of being alone. Some people should never feel loneliness at this level. Cheadle's character Johnson reflected the total opposite of Sandler's character Fineman. Where Johnson felt captivated by his blessings, Fineman tried to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful additive for cast and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. A very nice movie. If you've ever lost and felt alone, this movie will assure you that you're not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
