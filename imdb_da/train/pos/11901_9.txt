As far as I can remember, Balanchine's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of Grossvatertanz (a traditional melody played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give the children a final dance before their scene is over. <br /> <br /> 2) A violin solo written for, but eliminated from Tchaikovsky's score for The Sleeping Beauty, interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship with the music of the growing Christmas tree that occurs shortly after. <br /> <br /> 3) The Solo for Sugar Plum Fairy's cavalier is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me the accusation that Balanchine somehow has desekvat Tchaikovsky's great score is wrongly placed.
