It is amazing that as many people as I know have not seen this little gem. everyone I have turned on has come back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT FILE !! <br /> <br /> I've never really looked after Brad Pitt (though his twelve-monkey and Fight Club shows are improving), but his performance in this movie as a psycho is unpleasant, dark and straightforward. Everybody else in the movie offers great performances, and the slow and conscious pacing of the movie greatly improves the case. The sense of fear of the characters continues to grow as they come to realize what has really happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is what came before it, the end is a bit too long and overblown. But that is the only fault I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you check out this movie, try to get the non-rated director's cut to the best view. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
