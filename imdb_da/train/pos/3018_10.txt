This movie is an exception to the rule that a successor is worse than the original. Its comedy at best. This movie is a quick action slapstick comedy where something seems to happen every second. For more than one occasion, the whole audience laughs at a joke. Having seen the first movie is a big advantage, but it's not a requirement. GÃ¶ta Canal 2 also has the advantage of being a parody in recent decades in reality production TV series as survivors (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for the Swedish audience. Then you cannot see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
