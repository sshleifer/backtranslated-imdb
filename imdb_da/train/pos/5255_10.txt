Tim Meadows must be the most underrated by SNL's latest cast members. What was originally a small forehead, looking at a blurred gigilo, evolved into a thoroughly entertaining 90-minute drive, albeit still low-brow. Don't pop this in expecting beautiful movies or Oscar-worthy performances. Going into it expects brilliant sadness with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell does what they do best - so the audience laughs. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Ladies' Man" Phelps is a naive, sympathetic radio sex show host who knows very little about everything except the ways of cheek. As a gifted ladies man, he makes waste to the wives of countless saps who have the band together to hunt him. The director does an inspired job to lead the actors into a comical trick that is entirely for the lack of plot development. How much plot would you expect from a SNL shit? While some scenes are slightly off the mark, Meadows' one liners and absurd sexual comments hit the fun leg fairly. In a comparison, Meadows compares to Mother Theresa, but to Bonin '. Sure it's crass, but don't we all in the privacy of our home a chuckle out of his advice to a whole city to "do it in the butt"? In another scene, immediately after a hearty kiss with the female leader, he suddenly remembers that the name of his would be charitable, a woman he slept with many years ago. He stands up in front of the woman who of course has fallen for him and proclaims that "The Ladies' Man is back" to her obvious chagrin. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball out of the park as a bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, the suppressed gay, round out solid performances. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're into adult humor. If not, stay away with extreme prejudices.
