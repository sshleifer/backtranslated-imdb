Some war movies succeed where others do not, and it can be judged from a number of angles. The humanistic angle in which one can feel the raw feelings (the terror of being under attack, the companionship of soldiers, the hard trials people face in them when they are in battle, etc.) is always film I find compelling. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies that you feel a connection to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie also succeeds at this level. It speaks of "The Supreme Honor" and the honor does the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing they had honor, and it is recognized in a way that is totally incompatible with Western thought, but ultimately it is a true honorary story. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
