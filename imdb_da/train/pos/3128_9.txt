Corny! I love it! Corny - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt revive the same screen chemistry that never seems to have left! They relive old memories, as well as the actors who play them from the 1960s show some back-scenes things that are quite interesting to know. The 1960s TV was corny escapism for so many of us since then, and this DVD is no exception if you are familiar with the original TV show. The battle situation with the written Boofs and Bams or whatever is great !! The movie scene shows clips of the villains who passed by. In the end, Frank Gorshin looks out. He didn't die too long after this DVD was made, I think, so it is to his great credit that he came back to play a bad guy for Adam and Burt just as he did for Batman & Robin many years ago. He didn't lose his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar to revive a heavy, too. Finally, I think this DVD is good memories and I would like to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys !!!
