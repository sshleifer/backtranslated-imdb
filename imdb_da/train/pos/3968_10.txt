I first saw this movie as a young boy and recently bought it on DVD. James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a hard-working and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the Presidency is limited by his family life, which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent depiction of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job, and they differ for a while; Chip's Best Friend and Mediator Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a warfare; Chip's son, Mike, arrives in the navies during World War II. Through it all, the family continues with bravery and dignity. The action sequences are quite exciting, and the film's semi-documentary style works efficiently. And the music from Max Steiner says it all; fidelity, courage and integrity. This country owes much gratitude to the FBI's men and women and yes to J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr. Hoover's form of vigilance had been adhered to, we could have been spared 9/11, the increase in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to deal with since he passed by.
