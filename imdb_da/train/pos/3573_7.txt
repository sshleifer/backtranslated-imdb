this movie was almost a fantastic imaginative movie. A mix of shakespeare, pop, jazz and faerie stories. This film was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. With a strong casting, led by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything that went for it. Everything except production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with one over the top production like this, it came out with the same seedy quality as everyone else made for TV movies. Besides better filmography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
