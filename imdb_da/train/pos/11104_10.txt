As the Godfather saga was the mafia's outlook from the executive suite, this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the workman's point of view. If you've never seen this show, you're in for an extended treat. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and is necessary to contrast Tony Sopran, the thinker's gangster, with the reality of the life he has been born to and honestly would never have left himself knowing how to many of his contributors have ended. Tony Sopran can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist and then kill a man with a frying pan in a rage and while he knocks down and dispenses the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter by the jar and give the nephew advice on his upcoming marriage as if they had just finished a Sunday afternoon watching the NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife when he gets the chance for a resort, finds out that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that come with it, and looks the other way toward her indiscretions about life alone. If you followed it all, you know how it ends. If you didn't, believe me, you've never seen a TV show like this.
