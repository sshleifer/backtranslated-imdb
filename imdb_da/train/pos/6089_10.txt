OK, I just overestimated it a little to compensate for at least one of the grumpy reviews. But I enjoyed it. I didn't laugh aloud, but it kept my interest and pulled me together without ever dropping me. The story was built. Yes, you knew it would have a happy ending - this genre always does. Meanwhile, it was quirky with sight gags you could miss, so beware when you look. Stiller and Black delivered professionally once again. Good team. They should work together more. Don't know it will be a cult classic, but it was definitely a fun trip. Not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is it? It's still worth going out of your way a little to see this movie.
