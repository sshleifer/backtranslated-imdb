The first time to see Buster Keaton's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it very much and only wish I had stumbled across it many years ago. Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Age single nitrate print was rediscovered and rescued in 1954 right before the incineration, and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated. So it's rocket viewing in places, but I've seen and survived much worse. It would have been OK as the 3 short films, but as an intolerance intake it is inventive and fun from the start to the finish: in the Stone Age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus; At the Roman age Buster riding a cart with wheel lock and adapted to the sled, No parking sign in Latin; In this technological age of speed demand and greed, his car falls beautifully to the first hump. Both he and Beery are after the girl of all time, an infinite threat. Favorite piece: Like the caveman, he is knocked backwards over a cliff edge, but still throws a kiss at the camera - a great second or two! <br /> <br /> Big things that confirm my love for silent movie comedy.
