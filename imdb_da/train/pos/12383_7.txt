Christina Raines plays a lovely model in New York, looking for a new apartment and starting to meet strange neighbors and revealing a secret about the building and slowly developing herself up to a high point at the end of the movie. This movie has all sorts of nice record elements from the Roman Catholic Church vs. the devil to the gate of hell to bizarre rituals, to a growing conspiracy and finally to a number of talented famous actors and actresses who flood the movie. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum. Forget John Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors hammer it - especially Burgess Meredith gives a nice comic / demented performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable as Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performing artists have virtually nothing to do like Jose Ferrer in an unimaginable role, even though it is no more than a cameo. Sentinel is a great horror movie with lots of psychological elements and some really scary scenes. The final scene is repulsive and yet chilling. I find fault with some of the free sex and violence in the movie, especially the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I do not think. The father / daughter's stuff was also a bit as good, but generally the film works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner does a work-related job and is effective at creating tensions and scary movie moments. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
