Here comes the term "classic film" from. This is a wonderful story of a woman's courage, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan was sold to her scary man who over the years learned to appreciate her. (Yes, a pear !!) Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress Oscar the year before for her little role (and what a waste of an oscar) in "The Great Zigfield". It really didn't show what was some talent she had other than her exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she also had no good costumes. People say she didn't show any real feelings in this movie. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and busy woman with inner strength. She is quiet during parts of the movie with only her eyes and body to convey her feelings. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when loot was shot. If you say she doesn't work well in this movie, you DO NOT see! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows he can work too. His character is not a sympathetic to me. He never sees her for what she is until the end of history. A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. The greatest of all, the beauty from within, like a gem. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to watch this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best films that Hollywood's golden age created.
