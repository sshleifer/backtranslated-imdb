This is one of the greatest sports films ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports characters of American history. What makes James J. Corbett's story particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the box style that continues to this day. In that respect, James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But getting back to the movie was all performances excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And even though it is a period, the story is always the test of time; It has not become obsolete. Ward Bond's depiction of John L. Sullivan must be one of the great portrayals of a real-life character in the film's history, and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-organized and highly effective. It combined with a good script makes this movie a must.
