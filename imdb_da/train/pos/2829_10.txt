Private Lessons II is without a doubt the greatest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese import (poorly) translated into English, it is a pleasure to see. Not much of it makes sense, but it doesn't matter. It is the greatest comedy without ever being fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is rare and unavailable on video, but I've caught it a couple of times late, late at night on payment cable. My taped copy has been seen dozens and dozens of times as I slowly personally introduce this movie gem to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays tutor / lover to Ken, our hero. (Apparently she has only worked for her check.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, from the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives it all and has big hair through the movie. Stacy Edwards, from the "In the Company of Men" fame, also appears in the film and is probably happy that she found other filmwork afterwards. <br /> <br /> Finding out what the plot is is at least three views. With repetitive viewing you can enjoy items like the abnormal amount of vases Ken has in his house (at least 50) or that Ken has a shirt with embroidered corn grains in the film's finale. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable but very quotable. My friends and I resume the whole scene. Yes, it sounds like we are lame losers and we are ... but we are lame losers who have seen "Private Lessons II." Be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You want to thank me for that.
