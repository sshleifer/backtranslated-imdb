I have a six month old baby at home and from time to time she struggles to sleep very badly. One morning she had a particularly difficult time sleeping, as doodle bops theme song came on T.V. She stopped crying almost immediately, and the rest of the show was happy. I sat her in her bounce seat and saw her kicking her legs, swinging her arms and actually laughing at this show. It kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also got a video of them, so in some cases, when my little one is confused, I have something to calm her on. Well, late at night, if she dares to colic to uplift doodle bops is not her cup of tea, but they will certainly be useful when I need some time to do housework, etc. The biggest surprise about doodle bops is that my child doesn't even like to see T.V. She would rather be in the floor with toys or with our little toy pad, but look at T.V. however, doodlebops have completely caught her attention. I do not know if she will continue to like them in the future, but now she is attached.
