I watched this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it. It is a rich, warm novel brought on display, beautifully acted and well-directed. More than anything, it reminded me of David Lean's movie, both in its ability to handle a complex history and its ability to create powerful scenes that affect you on several levels. The best movie I've seen this year.
