This is a really fun, breezy, light hearted romantic comedy. You can't go wrong with Meg Rysy's sweet perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I am not a fan of completely fictitious stories about real people, now deceased and unable to defend themselves, but I think that late Einstein might even have got a chuckle out of it. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story is about a beautiful, young, scatter-hearted mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all willing to marry a broken jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, just because he has the brain she's looking for in her father's future children. But it is love at first glance when her car breaks down and she meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). When she doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough, Uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays the match maker, assisted in his efforts by three evil comrades, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert has to make Ed seem smart, so a charade that shows him as a physicist collides with ... of course with entertaining results. Walter Matthau is his usual fun self and draws Einstein's character completely out. With his three professorial friends, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, there are many laughs. The real Einstein had a real human side, and this movie just takes one (monstrous) step further. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening! <br /> <br /> It can't be rocket science (despite the protagonist), but it's a wonderfully sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best comedy romance genre.
