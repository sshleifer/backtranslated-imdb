In reflecting on this movie, I can think of two others to help put it into perspective. A relatively forgettable but covering the same geography, the Coup de Torchon, the other thousand kilometers away and much larger is the unforgettable indokine. Claire Denis has produced a film that has some of the great bases in Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was hit by Potee's dignity, with his struggle to preserve his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck by the love relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its impetus, the latter linking this movie with Indochine. <br /> <br /> Even if some of the characters are required to commemorate colonialism, you are never sure what motivates everyone. It is this cynical side of the story that binds it to the Coup de Torchon. Their is the more scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis gives us a reminder of how it was with all tensions and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American variety that gives adult France a start at the beginning and end of the film offers yet another interesting side to the confusion we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says when he came, he wanted to call everyone's brother. He came home, but they just thought he was a little daring. France, the sign and the girl grew up in Cameroon, but do not quite understand what it is, even though they remember how it was. <br /> <br />
