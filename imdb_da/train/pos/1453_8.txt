Well, there are plenty of ways to destroy a political thriller. Usually, they are derivative or too ambitious, often having a conspiracy that is completely paranoid and incredible. But the town hall does not do any of the above. The reason is cleverly designed, the story is credible. As far as signs go, I would say that this movie is a solid average. No sign seems out of place, and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is excellent and again shows that Al Pacino is the absolute top of American players today.
