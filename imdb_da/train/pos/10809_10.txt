Russell, my fav, is beautiful in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a huge spectrum of human passion and sorrow. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer aware that tolerance from other people gives the route to save humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I play their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All characters are cast and portrayed very well.
