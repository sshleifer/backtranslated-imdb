I remember this game. It was always on the shelves alone until one day I decided to try something new for a change and got this game. I stared in awe of it as it was the first game for PS1 I owned that had 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn't put control down seriously. The story of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and it's hard to achieve. When you play the game, you become involved in the characters, it is amazing that it is only a PS1 game, as it feels like a movie. And I think it should be made into a movie. <br /> <br /> It is too bad that this game is a very unheard of game and almost no one has played or wanted it, as it is one of the games that are on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% off sign sitting on it, trying to sell. Now I am one of those people who always look at them at the ends and try them out, and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, how did I get into Final Fantasy VII, look in a catalog and find it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games. I wouldn't be surprised if it was made by Square Enix, but it's not. Almost some of the games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series but this one is. But what really bugs me is why it is very little known and not praised, which it must be. The graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It's PS1 man, made in 1999. History I've already mentioned is fantastic, almost beats VII. Characters are a fantastic, you get involved so much in them and their actions. One particular 10 out of 10. Absolutely deserved more praise and a very well done RPG by a company other than Square Enix.
