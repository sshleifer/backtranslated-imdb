Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez), who supports the poor in his country, can be held in such low honor in the United States. In my opinion, his worst "sin" is caring for those at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about? I have always been fascinated by the US government + media reaction on Fidel Castro. First, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he replaced Batista. But soon, Castro began turning the companies in Cuba against the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and government have such a problem sharing with the poor? If these guys are "dictators" then we could use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
