Still love it 17 or so years after the first time I saw it, I actually discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very sorry. Despite the fact that it is not unified with the original (as a child I have never noticed, and as an adult I do not care about), that is what drawings * should be like. Just dark enough to be interesting and easy enough to be enjoyed by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents raised me to this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our children nothing. The music is amazing and stuck in the head for you ... I've downloaded the entire soundtrack at some point.
