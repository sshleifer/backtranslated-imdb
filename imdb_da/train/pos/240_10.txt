Great film. One to undo all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information should be taken as factual information. True Hollywood Conventions are used as playing a list and very attractive actors like "the heroes" like Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand) and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunk and corrupt Victorian police force. This also creates a very unreliable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics, where women are particularly receptive. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning, and his father calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in the eye as he looked down at me, the hand on my shoulder", it is very romanticized and persuades viewers aside with Ned Kelly, underdog. Besides, not all Aussies love an underdog?
