I'm glad other people have had this movie because I know it doesn't have the biggest reputation and it made no money at the box office. I thought it was great, and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich controls with the lightest touch, the casting (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect, and Big Bad Apple has never looked better at movies. You've seen worse movies!
