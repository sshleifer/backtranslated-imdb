I saw the subtitle as it was in Russian, but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born cursed with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived unhappy all his life because he was different, and because anger gave him to do mortal things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him who ended up in a deadly battle. There were quite a few things, but not too much for the weak stomach. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the ordinary old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent movies. Kinda got the feeling of an Asian fantasy film.
