This is a beautiful movie visually. The pictures of the Mexican desert, the ancient mansion, the signs of their picturesque costumes ... are all a real work of art. The story seems a little loose, but that's because it's not supposed to be realistic. It is taken from a book called a hundred years of loneliness, and it must be an expression of the isolated world-world atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States". The enormous debt owed by Erendira to his grandmother is symbolic of Latin America's international debt burden, although there are many layers of importance. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate a slow, rich movie, this one is for you.
