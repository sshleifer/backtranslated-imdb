Here is another beauty in the twist of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of star-studded lovers (an Israeli, a Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of inter-ethnic conflict, but also from conflicts that are both personal and political within ethnic groups. For example, there is a narrative moment when one of the secondary characters, obviously gay, is visited in the hospital by his girlfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. It is clear that the young man is not as open as he thinks, and the family does not accept as he may want them, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A lot of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a champion to effectively pack emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective in the uniform way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelis and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you are not heartless, you will cry through the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us how satisfactorily good melodrama can be.
