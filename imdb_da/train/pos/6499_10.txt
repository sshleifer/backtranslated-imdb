After all these years, I still consider this series the best example of World War II documentary film production. Interviews with the many participants from all countries separate this from any other project. It would be great to see a modern documentary (Ken Burns?) Take on this topic and try to collect information from veterans before they are gone. With modern technology for improving old archive movies and lots of information that has been invented since 1974 when World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. History Channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of World War II, but an expansive series such as the World At War has not been tried successfully since the original. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. It is necessary to look.
