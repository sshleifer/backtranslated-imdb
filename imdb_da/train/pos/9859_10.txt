Ice Age is not just Animation of the Year (in my eyes) It's also the best animated feature I've ever seen! The Teasers told me last year and I have spent many good hours on the internet site. Scrat is cool! And then the rest of Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the picture. <br /> <br /> I saw their journey of laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing was forced or over done. The sensitivity was real, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that affects me this deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox Production. And before it was the Land before Time 1988. Everyone possesses real charm and seeks to entertain the entire audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
