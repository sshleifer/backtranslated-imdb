This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a HUGE fan of disaster movies, even though this is a family movie. The accuracy of the film from the book is one and a half and a half. They got the names to the right, but in the book there was no storm chaser, the car scene that involved the Hatch family running away from the tornado, was not in the book instead involved Dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on the way to the police station for security . and in the book Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. That's all I can think of. All in all it was a good movie, although it could have been a little more precise in the book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes that destroyed a small Nebraska town in 1980?
