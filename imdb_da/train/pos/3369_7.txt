Despite what the title might mean, "Pigs Is Pigs" does not stand Porky Pig. Rather, it has a young pig with an appetite more insatiable than John Beluso's character in "Animal House". His mother repeatedly repeats him, but it does not do well. So much so that he goes to another house where a forged scientist forces him more than any kind of deadly handling (but there is a surprise at the end). I would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a placeholder between the really big cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after this came out). But don't make a mistake, they do some nice things here. The entire power supply sequence looks more relevant today, as the obesity epidemic overtakes our country. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not the greatest cartoon, but worth seeing.
