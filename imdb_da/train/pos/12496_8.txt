For years we've seen all horror movies coming out of the boring Hollywood retreads like Saw 2, to horrible indie releases that are totally unmatched ... we suffer through all the bad movies hoping to find little gems like "Dark Remains" . <br /> <br /> We managed to get a screening of this movie at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I think it ended up winning the best movie award. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have the budget of the study film or the star force, it packs a serious blow into the eerie atmosphere and scares the category. The action and cinematography is top notch, but that is the direction that makes this movie worth seeing. The story and characters evolve at just the right pace to give some amazing scares. <br /> <br /> Editing and visual eg are also top notch. And although many horror films fail to use music for their benefit, the point for "Dark Remains" only gives increased sharpness. <br /> <br /> I know the movie has appeared on a bunch of festivals, but no one has been near me, so I can't wait to hear when it finally comes out on DVD. Believe me, even if you are sick of the current state of horror film, give it a try ... you will not regret it!
