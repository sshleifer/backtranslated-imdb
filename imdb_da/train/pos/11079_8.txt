I always enjoy watching movies that make you think and not just drip-feed the answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of those films, and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a little concentration and an open mind, I got it. First time. It is true that it does not compare with other mind-mucks such as "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but in itself it is an intelligent and thought-provoking film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how marvelous it is. Every scene looks like all camera angles have been thought for years. If you see it, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So to conclude ... see it with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If not, well, no one ever said "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
