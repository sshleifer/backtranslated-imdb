If you want to see something that is for 'him' and 'her' so to speak then it's the movie to choose. I am a sucker for room coms but my husband is not always so keen (what a guy !!!). Still, I managed to make him see it because I told him it was about sports and you know what he loved it !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very fun and her leading man (sorry but can't I remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie it was called 'The Perfect Match', but I think the title was changed to the UK as it is based on the book Feber pitch and there was already a movie about football with the title (the same movie but the UK version - phew!), <br /> <br /> However, all reviews here will tell you more details if you need them, buy girls, take it from me, get your hubby in front of the television on a Saturday tonight and you will both laugh and cry together. A real gem.
