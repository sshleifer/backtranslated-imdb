This movie is about Queen Victoria's life during her youth and her first few years as the Kingdom of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has a fantastic production. Each scene is designed and decorated for immaculate details. The extravagant costumes, sumptuous places and beautifully landscaped gardens make all "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most amazed at the thought-provoking movie. Where each person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that hits me the most was when Victoria speaks to Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle, while from the Melbourne angle Victoria was located between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips. Historically, it is far too compact to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a big scene in the coronation, and disappointingly it lasted only a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a great movie and it would have been even better if it was longer so events could be properly explained without rush.
