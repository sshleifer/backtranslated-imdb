Terry Gilliam gives a great movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the little looks of Christover Plummer make the movie brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and twelve monkeys are definitely in my top 10. I think this is one of the four best Bruce Willis movies; and Brad Pitts best. Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance. Perhaps one of the ten best actors performance I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. Bruce Willis's role (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted exceptionally well. With the brilliant history of backing the great performances; and to back up, Terry Gilliam's excellent instructor.
