As a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can from the history of my new religion. I was invited to attend a screening of this movie with my sons and the other young men and women as well as their families in our department. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring night we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the Church's historic village there. We should have had reservations at Vistor Center to watch this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to just a few church documents, I was fascinated. The only "full length movie pictures" of the church I had seen were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> Initially, missionary interpreters passed through tissue that more people had been deeply moved to tears of this movie. I thought "OK ... but it takes a lot to move to tears." Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It is truly a very moving and inspiring testament to the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> See it and believe it is a strong message!
