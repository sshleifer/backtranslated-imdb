I went into The Straight Story and expect a sad / happy type of drama with good direction and some good actors. I got these. What I did not expect was an allegory for human existence attempts. Add it to Lynch to take a simple story of a 300 mile ride on a lawn mower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, watch it again and pay attention to Alvin's age, the terrain he runs through, the reactions people give him, the kind of discussions he has (one of those first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside a cemetery). The last road he is driving down is particularly joking in this context, as it narrows down and his fear and nervousness are. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine in connection with a survival, where he achieves the desired reunion. I hope only some of the people who have felt this as a slow juicy melodrama take the time to look with a more holistic attention.
