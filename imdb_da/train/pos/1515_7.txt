Amicus made close to half a dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70s, and this, from leading horror writer Robert Bloch, is one of their best efforts. There are four stories, all worth it, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method for Murder" - distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys for fear. In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widow whose lovely daughter (Chloe Franks) gets angry with his neglect and brutal intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll, which she expresses her disgust for his methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of evil evil and delivers one of the greatest children's appearances in a horror movie since Martin Stephens in "The Innocents". This episode is aimed at great subtlety, and the last disgrace that takes place outside the screen is a moment of purest horror. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" is about a horror writer (Denholm Elliott) threatened by one of his own creations, the eerie Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and strong terror. Dominic may or may not be right, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. The short shot from Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow is really joking. The original poster art with a skeleton figure adhering to a tray holding Peter Cushing's cut head was a rich lure for punters determined by fear.
