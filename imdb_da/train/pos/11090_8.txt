Successfully self-made married businessman Harry Mitchell (an excellent steal performance by Roy Scheider) has a main line of flirting with the sweet one 'sexy young stripper Cini (the beautiful Kelly Preston). Harry is discouraged by a trio of scummy lifetime caps - the shabby porn theater manager Raimy (an excellent slimy John Glover), antsy strip joint owner Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and crazy pimp Bobby Shy (a terribly intense Clarence Williams III) - who has video recorded his affair with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoodies kill Cini and make it look like Harry did. This again turns on a dangerous battle of wild and will between Harry and hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, who adopts a hard script based on Elmore Leonard's huge criminal thriller novel, academically maintains a stably creeping pace, delivers lots of exciting tensions, and effectively creates a convincing seedy's orderly atmosphere. The wires are all equally excellent, with stand-out supporting turns from Ann-Margret as Harry's bitterly neglected wife Barbara, Vanity as the brash jaded prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle. The tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes all the way through. The vicious profane dialogue, Jost Vacano's shiny filmography, Gary Chang's agitation score, the hard amoral tone and the outrageous conclusion are also equally good on the money. As an added bonus, both Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A very strong and satisfying small number worth checking out.
