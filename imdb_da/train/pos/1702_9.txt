If you have trouble dreaming, give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this movie was not made to please anyone, just people with a sense of humor. For them, the movie is amazing! It plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows far away, most of the witch, where B-rated ones. In line with Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may have to stretch your imagination a little to get the jokes, but it's well worth it.
