Cypher is a movie worth watching because it is not the Sci-Fi flip tab. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. Close-ups of the camera are how the director keeps the plot illusory. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the film's plot. The technology used in the film is not too impressive, but the director makes good use of the props. <br /> <br /> The character development is deliberately superficial. The protagonist, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself in the espionage world. It's up to the audience to find out his enigmatic character, and it's a mystery that keeps the audience interested in the end.
