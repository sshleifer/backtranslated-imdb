In the colonies we are not everyone who is familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (which recently had its TCM preview) because of the negative comments here on his appearance in "Ghost Train" - which I expected Be thoroughly annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing of delivering a line suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparison with him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual providers of comic relief that comes up in films of this genre. One can also feel that the thread connects Askey with British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python squad than with any of his colleagues above. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll be in the end, but it's still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next look.
