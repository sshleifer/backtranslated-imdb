Some people loved the "Aristocrats" and others hated it and often went out in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard are not likely to be so extreme - if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that does, we must say enough use of the "f" word that his program would be a long beep if it was presented on the television. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they don't see any mistakes in his performances. On the other hand, I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest, but more often than not fun and in spots, quite funny. He has the opportunity to connect references from routines early in the show to his later routines. He is not a story count. He is not a joke maker. He is not a frantic fantasy player like Robin Williams. He plays around with ideas, some of which work, and some of them - a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz - are for example. Totally involuntary. However, he has a way of gracefully moving past the flopped routines and expanding those who connect. I gave this achievement a 7 and can be persuaded to raise it to a 8. But a 10? No way.
