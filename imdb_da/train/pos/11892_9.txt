Pialat film people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, he deals with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son when she dies of cancer. In an hour, teenage girl's sexual experiment leads to violent confrontations with his family. Here we have a pretty spoiled young woman who surrenders her husband to take up with a sexy ex-con. Her motivation is a little overcast as Loulou is unable to read or discuss anything more challenging than television shows; on the other hand, he has a fantastic body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show the physics - he would have been good as a rugby player). Casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give a bland, inconceivable performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamics and charm you could wish for - see the stage in the bar where he is stabbed in the intestines, runs away and seeks treatment, then restarts soon with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with the black-and-white eyes and nervous look, plays Nelly's husband beautifully; it is a good repetition of the mating in the Coup de foudre.
