The first movie had little ambition, so nothing was bumped on the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero charm. Once you accept that Bill & Ted are nitwits, the joke can only be hammered to the audience so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> With today's standards, this is more fun. This was dismissed after release, sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time. We get the photographer 'Face / Off', the editor of 'Fugitive', a production designer from Burton's early work and the sound designer of 'Matrix'. The writers made their shallow first trip with something deep. When this was outraged by fan base and public, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not appropriate for the material. Like 'Death Becomes Here' and 'Catch-22', it dares to be smart, but we like our movie "simple" so we don't buy it. Probably as this would be different, why did it take 12 producers to pull it off. What's so good? <br /> <br /> - Nice self-reference to Keanu; from airhead to messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates his colleagues he does his own hatred. The evil B & T and the "good robot user" have the same vocabulary as their originals: smaller copies and depreciation of languages. <br /> <br /> - "Duality" motif. Nothing else is clear than in the photographic styles, many high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith from 'Total Recall' to highlight the point. <br /> <br /> - "Selection" motif. I don't know where this started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's been used quite well here. It even boils down to the 7 games against death - battleship and club. <br /> <br /> - Film self-reference, even present in the fight against Death (Clue). This is wiser than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the Premier Magazine cover at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Jegronic also how Death and Nomolos were villains in 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' sequels. <br /> <br /> I still have some smaller nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and movies are different media, so it makes no sense why many scripts are about the former - especially the teenage market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these films he is wasted. Also, for all the daring shows this effort, even by blowing up gay jokes, can't they kill a cat? So even though it looks like a Nickelodeon production, it's incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in Heaven and we hit only three people." <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Midrange Material
