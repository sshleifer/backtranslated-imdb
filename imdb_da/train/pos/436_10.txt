I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not even sure what's special about it, but I think it was wonderful and should be accessible to DVD. The women were strangers and did well enough to spend the time they did in Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all so diverse and yet clever stories that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship problems in good time. This requires 10 lines, but I just can't think of more to say, so I'll just rattle on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What can I say, it has been a long time since I last saw it. I look forward to seeing again, but it is not available.
