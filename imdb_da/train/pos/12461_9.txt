A smart script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and clever performances by the two male leaders - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or vice versa) result in an exciting and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to the above-mentioned competent direction from the veteran JEAN HERMAN and a scanty but effective score of FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX it becomes easy why this film has an unequal timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friend's buddy or bonding story with two practitioners, both disillusioned and tired of the world, returning, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial forces of this time (after World War II, which entered the 60s), France had struggled to keep an eye on the appearance abroad. Losing algae was a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) crowns our two (anti) hero's actions as they struggle to make a turn of it after their release. /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the viewer must really pay attention because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script: if it is, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> It is probably enough to say that these two men are fighting it physically and psychologically, a long weekend. Their motivation is completely different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. The fact that ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so diverse - the former, probably a beautiful boy, and the latter an ugly dandruff, adds to chemistry. <br /> <br /> That quest creates a great story which, in turn, makes for a good movie. Let me forget that there are women in this movie, and truly the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, but not nearly as flute; To say much more would be to indulge in the joy of discovering their true nature. FAREWELL, THE FRIEND WAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE WEEK; AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; ONLY in English only (not even subtitles for the audible hearing); A running time of 110 minutes; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but DE ROUBAIX music has lots of beats! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
