This movie is one for many years. First of all, I must say that having seen this once, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (author, director) has composed a genuine work of art. Where 99.9% of movies these days are pure entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The ordinary media spins and spins, but Ben Coccio sees facial plays that can go where no other kind of media has ever gone, into the thoughts and hearts of two young men who are planning to kill their classmates. Although it is certainly graphic and terrible, how could it not be? The gloves come out, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters are brushed aside, and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it is not just a screw that everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hate and isolation are deeper, more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them. Society left them and the consequences are terrible and real. Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all need to learn, thank you so much for making this movie Mr. Coccio, I hope with great expectation that you will continue your film-making career.
