The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really talks about volumes about the film. For me, this Grand Canyon supports a movie that will touch you somehow. I really think that before Grand Crash there was a movie crash. The big difference between the two films in my opinion is the time of their release. I don't want to argue which one is better, but I would be against the idea that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this subject. I want to start a comment that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to send other topics about movies that we can share because I have a real love for movies.
