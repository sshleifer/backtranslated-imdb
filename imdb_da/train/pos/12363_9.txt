This 1986 Italian-French remake of the 1946 movie with the same name shows the heat early and does not let us get up for air. The story is about a college student (Federico Pitzalis) who can't keep an eye on the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenom Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day he follows her and his persistence pays off. There is only one problem: She is engaged to a sketched character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who may or may not have committed a violent crime, and if he repents, he is likely to be beaten by a blow on his wrist. The young woman is also a little "funny in the head" and this is confirmed when we find that she has seen the boy's father who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is only tantamount to her incredible sexual desires. Warm, warm, warm, from the word, with beautiful wires and a boomhole performance from Detmer, who plays us as a yo-yo (as she does the boy) from stage to stage, with enough excitement to keep us guessing up until - and even after the end. Available in R and X (!) Rated versions.
