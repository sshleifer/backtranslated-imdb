I have no doubt that the critics bombarded this film, especially the artificial speed systems that need laxatives. This is a great car movie in the Abbot & Costello tradition or more recently Don Knotts. It won't shake the world or change movies forever. What it will do is entertain. When all is said and done, it is still the most important thing. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. It even has a simple and good moral message at no extra charge. I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. She did not steal her skitick from Vampira more than Vampira did from the original Theda Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to the one who does it best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; We need more of these kinds of movies. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He radiates a wonderfully refined evil. I couldn't find any technical errors. The design is as close to flawless as the art form becomes. My deep compliments to the director, James Signorelli, and all his crew members.
