Back in 2004 I saw "True", Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and got excited. It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much. Of course I wanted to watch the whole movie and I would even check who was attached etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, with the kindness of the internet. <br /> <br /> First of all I must say it looks AWESOME. The photography is BEAUTIFUL in every card and shot, in the worst case, nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. Later, I read trivia here, and maybe that's how scanning in 6K gives more justice to all DP's work. My special favorites are the first scene (Quays de Seine) (the sunlight!), Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement" - but you know what the hell I like them everyone: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still makes me nervous about the brilliant colors (my eyes tremble!) and the "Quartier Latin" is gold imprisoned on silver. Beautifully. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some beautiful short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's get into the content. I much (and I mean very much) like the eclecticism that is so happily felt. You never have the same themes or treatment between two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deeper things in shorts. I loved to come from a simple love story to a crazy-Chinese musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder for a social commentary on a terrorist comedy to a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It is good that they took a chance to let all these directors' meat distribute things that are not common in the mainstream cinema (which I have come too much contempt). It is not heavily experimental, but I can draw the breathing that these people had. <br /> <br /> I like the little time and I love the actor. I love simplicity and I love love. I like the simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism and generally it is a movie that is very nice to see alone or with someone. That simply feel. It felt very good. <br /> <br /> There's something serious about it ... it's so honest ... What I didn't like? Well, for me there are two shorts that are not the best - Quais de Seine "(which is good natural, safe and maybe even necessary, but feels too much like a commercial?) And" PÃ¨re-Lachaise "even though I love the play , I felt it was themes that were forced, but of course it's just me. "Tour Eiffel" I didn't love either, but I probably think because of my very different sensitivity from Sylvain Chomet? movies have a special interest in people who already know the actor and directors, and so they can enjoy their interaction, in the surprises (beware Alexander Payne in a fun role) and basically in "what will this instructor do with this? big question. I enjoyed it very much that way. <br /> <br /> Now I repeat: Most shorts I loved, and all make up a beautiful and energetic blend. I definitely recommend it. Definitely!!! Then see it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
