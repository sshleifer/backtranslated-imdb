ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart of a giant Irish family who continued to become the world's heavyweight master at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) walked around claiming he "could beat anyone in alive. " Both Flynn and Ward Bond provide what is probably among the best performances they have ever made on the screen. <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh has steered the colorful story with robust style and also captures family life with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. All Warner contractors make up the finest cast - including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's rambunctious father, proud of his son's fighting ability and ALEXIS SMITH, who gets the most out of his role as a feisty girl who enjoys taking Flynn down a point crazy one-liners dealing with his astonished manners. All the 1880s atmosphere is captured in brilliant B & W, although it is wrong Warners had no more faith in Flynn to make the film in color. He was entering a rock phase of his film career at the time, engaged in a widely publicized rape case, which had all the tabloids busy sorting things out. The fighting sequences are among the best ever choreographed for the screen, with Flynn of course in fine shape and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene at which Bond turns his Flynn pricing plate into a social gathering is one of Ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor. Summary: Maintains interest throughout, whether you are a sports fan or not.
