I am tired of people judging movies on their "historical accuracy". IT IS A MOVIE PEOPLE !! The authors and directors must put their own spin in history! There are a number of movies out there that aren't quite accurate with the story .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of Mohicans .... All Great Movies That Are Slightly Incorrect Historic . If you want to see some good actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie and not worry about the truth of the fact. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the story and one of the greatest actors of our time.
