Everyone knows about this '' Zero Day '' event. What I think this movie did was that the elephant wasn't that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the film, we like to laugh at them, even though we know what to do. And it gives me chills. Because I felt guilty of being cheered by their comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I knew what was going to happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie when they were committing suicide and just decided they did it on the 3 or 4 counter, I thought it was fun, but I was still horrified to see their head blown away. Of course I was. I like them. They might be evil, but I thought they were really normal guys that they didn't really understand. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> It's the IMO, the greatest force in this movie. It makes us realize that our friends or family or someone can plan something crazy and that we won't even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And so I can't go to bed right now. There is still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.
