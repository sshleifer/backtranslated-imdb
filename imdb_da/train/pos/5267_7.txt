Apparently Ruggero Deodato thought early on that his story would not work if he approached it too seriously, so he decided to camp it. The result is a movie that can be considered either a ridiculous sword-and-sorrowing epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the other way. The short gore moments are well finished, Paul Brothers openly opens the material (they even bark at each other in a scene!), And there is also a charming, exciting, good-natured performance by Eva La Rue, who the girl who tag along with "boys ". Plus, where else can you see the inside of a dragon illuminated as a disco ?? (***)
