Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a leading leading chess player trying a comeback on an Italian tournament. His glory is undisputed, but his obsession with chess has confused his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heir who has come to the same resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to depict possible marriage partners. Vera leans on a beautiful count, but surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met on a trip. Sascha is also taken with Natalia and suggests marriage at their second meeting. But with the concentration that Sascha is going to give to chess and with other events in his past that still cause problems, will he win the heart of Natalia? Oh, and can he become the chess master too? This is a nice movie based on a novel by Nabokov. The action is amazing, with Watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro complete perfection as the shy, unpleasant chess enthusiast. James gives a good trip as the indulgent mother and the other cast members are also wonderful. As for the film's appearance, it couldn't be better. The landscape is of the black-out-out variety, vintage costumes are beautiful and cinematography is deserving of much acclaim. Yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, sometimes it makes a movie that not everyone will appreciate. Then the end is also bittersweet. But if you love romance, period pieces, big acting, knockout scenery, or the beautiful art of creating a movie, don't miss this one. You will be defenseless as opposed to its many charms.
