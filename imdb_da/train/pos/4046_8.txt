Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an English woman who resided in France during the French Revolution apex. Rohmer was always thought to be a conservative, but he knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. If you can put away Rohm's immaculate defense of the monarchy (and it's not an easy thing to do, as the French lower classes, for example, are portrayed here as hideous louts), it is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished film. Missing the money for a great cinematic recreation in the 18th century France, Rohmer instead has the actors playing against obviously painted cardboard. It is a blatant artificial endowment, but it works in some way. And the newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make sympathetic a sign that should not be.
