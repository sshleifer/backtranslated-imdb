What the movie 60s really represent (to those of us who were grazing around in the stomach in America during these times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated stereotypical signs, the authenticity of the problems remains. <br /> <br /> Not only were they radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the media's overwhelming influence. These two new freedoms began social change, which soon became institutionalized. From the chaos came sensitivity, came the disorder from values. Remember, however, that most of the Americans were not involved in this ... they worked, they played, they watched the news ... and slowly they were done by the minority efforts and the struggles ... war effort, the war on poverty. <br /> <br /> The representation of the press and the power of the TV was especially reflected, although the conflict between the people's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored ... and in the worst case, wrong represented. The middle class Americans were not all about angry baseball bats or disowned their colorful daughters. They were also confused. Let's not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers, and how The Beatles began an attack that killed the People-Protest Movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think if you didn't live in the decade, you might not have a sense of what the movie is about, the overall picture is a little weak. At one point, I held a permanent job while my sister lived at Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another time I was in Haight Asbury and in Detroit Riots while working and playing housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles changed constantly. <br /> <br /> The film depicts three siblings in a middle class family. They represent the hippie child, the political activist and the active military perspective. Father represents the typical attitudes, and Mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes compromises ... for the sake of peace. The black family includes a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I believe. I suppose the manufacturers knew all the variables and had to settle restrictions, otherwise the movie would have become a long, dull, documentary. Father's message was that anger produces bitterness, and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message aimed at today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how problems share us ... The 60s were exceptional in that way and only Roaring 20s compare. In other words, this film has a morality. Ultimately, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put it on your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a Guru, or an outdoor recreation in the 60's. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever nail the 60s down right ... it was too different (this movie is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of the fact that we learned and grew from it, and that once a generation formed a form and changed America ... for the better.
