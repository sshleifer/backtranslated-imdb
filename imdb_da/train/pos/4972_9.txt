LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt I will look better this year. This beautiful tragicomedy of the Belgian film maker Benoît Mariage is located in the industrial water sports areas of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this, the son must break the record opening doors. What the father really wants for his son to be someone because he himself has never done so anymore as the reporter of local news for a newspaper called the ironic L'Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing works as planned. This movie can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäks OPERATING BOLDER, although it is more dramatic and humor is darker. As in that movie, the tone is more melancholy than depressing, and it ends up optimistic without being unrealistically happy. The humor is absurd without making the plot incredible, and Mariage finds amazing pictures in the gloomy settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEUR'S ATTENDENT is to perform by Poelvoorde. This actor shot fame with the also brilliant cult classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRES DE CHEZ VOUS, where he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then, he played only two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting abilities, and all the roles he was offered were reproductions of the Ben character. With his return to a leading role in the LCA, there should no longer be any doubt about his action. He is simply glorious as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he is done and be torn by remorse about it. One should see.
