The big bad swim has a low budget, indie feels about it. So many times I start to see independent films that have only had good reviews to find out that they are pretentious raw materials, voted by people who are so blinded by the film's idea and its potential to be provocative that they forget that the film is a form of entertainment first and foremost. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor if it does, I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the move, BBS went right, it was easy and warm and human, there were no big dramas or meaningful insights I was just associated with the characters straight out. And then, as with all good movies, the end came, I felt sadness at the loss of the connection. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something big, or fast or insightful, look elsewhere, look for a movie that is trying to deliver more than it can. BBS provides a solid, enjoyable, real-life experience, and I felt rewarded and satiated after seeing it.
