Forged and graphic gory Japanese film about small creatures that take people over and transform them into necroborg-zombie machines - which beat and chop each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, a few lovers are infected. Technically excellent horror comedy (?) Is only for those with strong stomachs, as blood and body parts go flying. Good taste prevents me from describing what is happening here, but let's just say it's pretty cruel. If you like this kind of thing with form, several steps over slim content, even see this movie. Personally, I am usually not one to enjoy movies like this on anything other than how sick and twisted they go on level. Here I was fascinated enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like gory movies .. It is also a movie with enough to take place in the details that I want to see it again since now where I knows what was going on - as revealed in the end - I want to go back and see what it was I didn't get in. There is an internal logic rarely in these movies. 7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and cut limbs, it's zero or more precisely a race and hide warning for everyone else.
