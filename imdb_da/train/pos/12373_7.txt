Time has not been friendly in this movie. Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, this movie now looks like a pure mainstream version of your typical spookfest. Terrible touches aside (especially the insane, over the top finals), it is essentially a blank scary movie for the people who don't care much about the genre. It has an extraordinary role in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive caste to convince the public that this is not your average lowbrow movie (producers of 70's disaster films had a similar idea). I liked watching the familiar faces, but the story is very stupid, and no matter how high the movie pretends to be, it operates at the level of your average 70's movie (not a bad thing). Still, it's an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlock's food is excellent. Overall, pretty entertaining.
