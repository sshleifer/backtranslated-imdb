Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably over-the-top (But he played similar parts in other films like "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent, but the movie was definitely "excited". <Br /> <br /> * gentle spoiler front *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was strangled in her movies, but I seem to remember various other examples. I want to avoid mentioning the killer, but I think it's necessarily obvious because of plot "thriller" requirements. A very well-designed but dated film noire (for example: everyone smoked as crazy, and the police were really making characters. And no dead bodies were ever shown, unlike today's gore fests.) Done in the well-known short-scene tableaux format of the period . <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
