Let me get the bad out of the way first, James Hanlon is terribly trying to act his descriptions of what was happening with rookie training and events of the day. Really, it is in sharp contract to the other firefighters without acting as desired, natural in their delivery. It is said that it is a fantastic movie that is impossible to see without tears in my eyes. I am an English guy from London, but I love New York and have visited many many times before and after September 11th. It's another home for me, and I can't help but feel ruined by the loss of life, but also the destruction of some of such a stunningly beautiful city. This is the right deal, with the firefighters with everything coinciding around them. I'm so happy that footage exists to show people how it was in the day. It is a pity that they did not use any pictures of people who jumped from the buildings because friends who were there tell me that this is such a large part of their memory that it should be included to show future generations how terrible It really was. <br /> <br /> By the way, conspiracy theorists can go to hell.
