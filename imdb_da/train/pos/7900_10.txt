I admit, the first time I looked at, even Cowgirls Get Blues, I didn't think it was very memorable in any respect. But now that I've seen the seventh time, I admit it has grown a lot on me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs Jellybean and Countess have become very appealing. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very cute. Although the reason is very weak, I think the satirical humor more than makes up for it. Then there is the kick-ass soundtrack that contains the extremely talented K.D. Long (which reminds me a little about Patsy Cline) at her best. I can't think of any movie that has "grown on me" for an inauspicious first impression, as much as Cowgirls has.
