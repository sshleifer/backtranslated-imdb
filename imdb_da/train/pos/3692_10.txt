I watched this movie a few days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. It was my last night in the French capital and the best farewell I could have chosen. These twenty episodes made me relive the impressions I had gathered in Paris in a heartfelt way without drifting into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprise, strong emotions and suggestive images, and each short film is directed to the rules of a good story. For me, this kind of film requires more talent and qualities of an instructor and a storyboard than any epic two-hour drama, and everyone has succeeded in their task excellently! The stories were carefully chosen for their matching arrondissement and perfectly expressed the respective flair. Each episode was seen from another ankle, had a different topic, a different style and still the twenty stories result in a harmonious film orchestra. The most outstanding advantage of the concept of episode movie is that you can switch between a large selection of emotions and moods without the risk of congestion, conversely: melange of grief, melancholy, pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique freshness and harmony. And not to forget about the subject of love! Love between the characters, love between the characters and Paris and also the love of the directors and the actors / actors for this project. I will not go into the details of the episode as there are so many, but I need to highlight a number of world-famous actors and actresses from around the world and their approach to this project. Some played with their image, some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes associated with their homeland or the roles they had played before, so intertextuality was given to the whole movie. All in all, I can definitely recommend this great collage and look forward to its release on DVD.
