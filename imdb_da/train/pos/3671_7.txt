"Hollywood North" is a euphemism from the film industry when they went to Canada to film because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw a lot of California invasions that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the upcoming personalities trying to exploit the economy presented by Canada. Needless to say, "Moon Lantern", the successful novel written by a Canadian writer, has become "Flight to Bogota" which has nothing to do with the original movie. A great selfish person has been Michael Baytes, obsessed with what is happening in Iran, offered the bulk, which turns out to be a disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to say that too many chefs have spoiled broth, which seems to be the case with the ultimate product saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who has been around making a documentary about the film being shot in Toronto, parts of the movie are finally transformed into a coherent film. The filmmaking is fun and the action is generally good.
