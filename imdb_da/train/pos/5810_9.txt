Sir. Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short film, ie music videos, is simply the best. I don't care if I get a healthy sci-fi feature from this man, but I don't care to get a medley of his crazy dance, screaming war, cool crowd choreography and some pieces of CGI and animation. There must also be a few uninterrupted videos. All I have mentioned is here. Stupid plot and over-the-top "vanity fair" is not a problem when I witness Michael Jackson in action. For me, he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not "King of Pop" that sounds moronic, especially to us, Russians, because "pop" sounds like the Russian word for "asses" and MJ is certainly not "king of donkeys "). I can see his best music videos again (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this movie was "What is this ...?" (bits of different videos, some drawn pictures, disturbing jumps from one theme to another, the lack of coherent plot line, some kids fool around, etc.) but when I saw it to the end, I could tell it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv today. What I also think here is that it never shows any shameful material and can easily be seen by the children. <br /> <br /> Without Michael Jackson, the universe of music videos would be pretty bad. Even the best classic videos from other artists cannot get very close to the energetic hyperbolic of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience of different ages, and he knew how to remain a man of moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I see a real DVD release with Michael Jackson videos, I know it deserves to be purchased even though some clips have already been recorded in another previous release. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are all good, but only "Moonwalker" is more like a movie (with a solid "Smooth Criminal" theme, "paparazzi" topic and a few weird spoofs and phrases). <br /> <br /> Become no fan of MJ I can still give this "movie ... like no other" a solid 9 out of 10 (I've been hit by "Smooth Criminal" for sure and my big complaints are the following : Initial segments of the movie could have been dropped, while the main "MJ anti-drug campaign" should have gotten more "sky-rocketing insanity and stress" and there should have been more "moonwalking" of course). Thank you for your attention.
