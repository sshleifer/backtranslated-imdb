WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA Kane vs MVP in an Inferno match: So this is the fourth ever inferno match in WWE and that's Kane vs. MVP (wonder why was the first match on the card). I have only seen the final parts, where Kane puts the MVP's ass on fire as they stand on the disguise, and then the MVP runs around in the arena while you cry ?? Ultimately, the refrain sets the fire out with a fire extinguisher as the MVP sprawls around the entrance ramp. Fun and visually quite entertaining ending. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: This was originally supposed to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) in a regular team holding. GM Teddy Long, however, comes to the ring and announces that it will be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in, and that's all chaos. A word to describe this eye-opener ?? wow. Man, I really can't remember how many sick spots were in this fight, and words can't really do it justice. There was a particularly remarkable place where The Hardys put a ladder in a saw-saw position, and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held the MNM for the kitten, and then WHAM! Nitro blew away while Mercury apparently botched it and blew like hell with scratches over his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the fight alone. Another place was when Jeff powerbombed London as he flew out of the ladder. There were other high flying breathtaking places for many to remember. London finally runs the belts to win this rave show stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Boogeyman vs. The Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out power bomb to victory and then and drools worms over The Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this three minute incognito. US Championship: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in another typical Guerrero battle. Some good spots included a superplex from the top rope of Chavo and an exceptionally long chain of German suplexes by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to stitch Benoit, but Benoit scares her and takes a long time to decide whether to put her in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go to a roll-up, but Benoit rolls it up again and Chavo is locked in Sharpshooter. Play over. Nice struggling fight albeit slowly at times. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for a fairly moderate pace match. The fight had some good high-flying spots ?? especially Helms' moves from the top rope ?? but the audience did not seem to be in it after seeing the ladder fight, and Yang needs to get more airborne. Helms won the fight after blowing Yang away with a face on his knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> Undertaker vs Kennedy in a Last Ride game: After a series of battles between these two, this time is a Last Ride match, the other ever in its kind and the winner must escort his opponent out of the arena in an elevator. Very good for what these two could offer. Kennedy handled a large part of Taker and was even free of a choke slam to throw Taker from the Armageddon set about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy almost got the prize until Taker came back inside the chain (I liked the camera's view inside the chain). Taker then missed a steel pipe at Kennedy and then hit the window instead, but later Kennedy threw himself with a chair and followed with a coherent chokslam and Tombstone on the roof of the hoist. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I found myself really interested in these guys willingness to take / give real sick shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa enters the ring, I go "what the hell?" like many of the kids in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie" comes in my ear. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena vs Finlay & King Booker: Talk about charisma vs. technicality. This struggle was actually a pretty good main event with momentum that rationally shifted from one team to another and maintained good excitement. Even Finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time (I doubted his strength against champs) and he and Booker failed to try to cheat at all? except at a time when Booker hit his scepter in Cena's neck. Batista hits Bomb on Booker for victory, did not get to see F-U; Cena did the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyway, and I think he also did STFU. This was probably the best technical battle of the night, and the participants did great for what they could without a ladder 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> Being an off-line WWE fan, I agree that Armageddon was laced up with many eye-catching all the way through, and the ladder match ultimately hit half of the show; The Last Ride match contained some rather nerve-racking spots, and the main event also made it good for its category. All other matches also lived up to their bill, except perhaps Boogeyman vs. The Miz bout and the useless underwear competition. In general, Armageddon was an extremely comfortable pay-per-view, and despite some major setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes to respect this year's farewell. PPV rating: 8/10.
