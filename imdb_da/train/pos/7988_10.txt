I am constantly haunted by family and friends for my tears over movies, and they were not disappointed when I looked at this. I cried many times, but believe me it was not over sappiness. I hurt the family and I hurt this man when he tried to solve himself the only way he knew how. Denzel was fabulous as always, and it was also Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I didn't even acknowledge the years haven't been kind to him. My husband is not one to watch movies again unless they are historically accurate war movies (cords !!!!) He has seen this movie five times now and I have to get the DVD to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it all the time I watched.
