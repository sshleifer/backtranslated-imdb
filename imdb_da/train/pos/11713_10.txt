I think it took a lot of courage for her to come forward as such. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers it is what helps people most. But in her case, what she did was remarkable. I've been in the mental area for five years and I think it's good that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I think she helped. I always thought she was great and always wants to. I'm glad she wrote this book and the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady, and I hope she continues to act. She has been through a lot and has faced it. I would really love to see her work more with children, especially children actors. Her trial should not have happened, and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people. The movie then moved to me that I was very touched. Suffering from a TBI that brought the start of my suffering and has PTSD, it is good to know that someone has the courage to show her life as she did. I think it helped this nation and people generally understand that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you, Mrs Duke, or Anna, who ever you prefer.
