This is a decent little flap made in Michigan, about a guy haunted by his past, with his fierce mate (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown up not so well adjusted. In fact, he is absolutely bonkers, but is not trying to be too obvious. He also has an entourage, his own little demon and angel who follows him around. The demon never says a word, but really, it doesn't, and he's Max Schreck's scary. Let's just say that the angel is basically spinning his wheels in this when Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" people he decides needs, because mostly beautiful young women. This is a decent depiction of madness, and of course you are at some point to find out some of what is going on, but in general, from the beginning to the end, it is very focused on the film, because it certainly kept my interest. It lacks a bit in some areas, but nothing I can really put my finger on. A decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer games.
