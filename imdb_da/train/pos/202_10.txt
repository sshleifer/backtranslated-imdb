A Give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors in their time - Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this movie + director Herbert Ross, and all that makes this stage fit into reality. Sunshine Boys is one of the best films in the 70s. I love that kind of humor in this movie, it just makes me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper only $ 3). I saw it as soon as I got home, but I had to see it again because I missed a few parts for the first time. The second time I looked at it, it felt much better and I laughed a lot harder. I will definitely resume this on DVD because I have to see the special features. It is very fun how it happens. Two people work together as entertainers / actors / artists. They meet well on stage but really argue from the stage, they can't survive another minute with each other, so about 15 years later you will reunite them into a television special. You can find it in this movie. Matthau & Burns was fantastic in this movie. It's a shame they died. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong cartoon performance. He was also 78 when this film was filmed. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an academic award in an old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for best support actor. He deserved the Golden Globe. Although many people may disagree with what I have to say, everyone in this movie gave a strong performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: The one who hates this movie is a "Putz"
