You won't be darker or tragic than "Othello" and this movie captures the game quite well, with excellent performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne expresses the viewer Othello's agony as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly, even delivering a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge over Othello or the object of his anger (it is not clear as no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp.) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is slightly marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also walk in and out of scenes, even though, like Iago, they seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the game to see how many lines were cut out, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even those seemingly insignificant, very well. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationship between some of the characters is no more. The director had a great cast, and no one offered a poor performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona must be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the film suggests, even though you get a feeling of this very late in the movie. Othello and Desdemona also need more time together. Although their anxiety is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other seems to be just meeting. On the other hand, maybe just met --- like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> In short: good performances, too short. <br /> <br />
