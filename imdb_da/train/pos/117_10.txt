Lars von Trier's Europe is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American who comes to post-Second World War in Europe and finds himself anchored in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war has gone on to work with his uncle as sleeping pictures on the Zentropa railway. What he does not know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called werewolves, targeting American allies. Leopold strongly opposes taking any sides, but is attracted to and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the femme fatal daughter of the railway company owner. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but was summoned by Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help get the German transport system back on track. The Colonel soon leaves or forces Leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if the werewolves can attack the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold gets stuck in an adventure by being involved in both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film-noir-ish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems. It's great to see the naive Leopold deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company officials coming to investigate his work ethic) before finally boiling and humorous and violently taking control . The film is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The movie has been stylishly shot, it always happens at night in winter with lots of falling snow. Its shot in black and white with shots of color that happens randomly throughout. Also background screens showing images that oppose the images in front. Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic tale, and Europe becomes a dreamy place that is out of this world. <br /> <br /> This is now a personal favorite movie of mine.
