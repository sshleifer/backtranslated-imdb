I do not expect the powerful "Girlfight" movie experience. It's an indie; low budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good but not so good. <br /> <br /> Located in a modern, ethnic working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job capturing the daily battles in the cities of Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, sucks with anger and lashes out at her high school students, in trouble with school and her friends. She is raised by her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but uses a strict, sex-based double standard on her children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, takes boxing at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny doesn't like boxing, so he and Diana act as he gets the money from father and gives it to Diana to take the homework in his place. <br /> <br /> It's actually a great movie when Diana grows and learns herself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues upside down. There is nothing gigantic, "everything that can go right, right" resolution a la "Bend it as Beckham". The reality and accompanying personal problems are too big for clapping solutions, but in my opinion "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying movie for it.
