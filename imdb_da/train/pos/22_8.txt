If you leap through the horrible song, you'll find a classic adventure underneath. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role. His trademark act works well for the sleek Puss in Boots. The other players are good for their parts. I didn't find any of the action terribly fake or awkward. The king seems to be a real dunce, and I wonder if he should be. I can't remember the original story. Special effects are typical in the eighties, but at least they are not too fake as some of the computer-generated fares we see today. In general, I recommend this movie to children and adults who are a child of the heart.
