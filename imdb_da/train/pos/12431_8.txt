Okay, frankly, I saw the examples of this movie and thought to myself, what do the producers think? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor possibly compete with Joly's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, they had two kinds of chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor matched to Joly's spark and fire. With regard to Hutton, he played psycho very well as opposed to David's quiet supply of life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and character development. I gave it 8 stars.
