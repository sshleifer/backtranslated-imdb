The 1986 television film by The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. The Creator of the Spirit, however, did not like the film and thus no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining movie and caught the spirit (excuse) of the comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry it wasn't a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect spirit. Nana Visitor was a lovely Ellen Dolan, and of course he would later move on to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's big-screen version of The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare gem of Spirit history. It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie from an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably search past versions of the property and release it to video to get a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas drunk Zorro's mask, we could get earlier versions of the masked DVD entirely, like the great Alain Delon version of the 1970s (though all the copies I've ever seen were poorly edited). Heres hopes that someone will release the Spirit's TV adventure to DVD soon.
