I almost missed the whole of the first season, but when the other shows went to reruns, I started to see. I ended up buying the entire first season from iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry humor has me rolling all the time. David Spade is fun, but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way. I enjoy the other cast members more (but don't say he doesn't add to the show). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you haven't checked this out, try it. If you can catch the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long time.
