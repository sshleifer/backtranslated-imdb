Surprised to see the pretty low score for this movie. Just experienced this movie for the first time in 10 years, and was reminded why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, at a time when Michael Keaton was a straight-up comedy guy and you can find some joy in this movie. It's a gentle comedy - the kind of Ron Howard specializes in - but if that's your thing, check this out. Keaton's key blend is right for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit dated because it takes place in the final phase of the world before the global economy when it is still important what country a company was based on. That said, it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other to great advantage. <br /> <br /> You could watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering a scene in particular you really wanted, but that's because the whole movie gives a slow but constant stream of laughs. It's like an I.V. drip. And I mean that in a good way.
