Personally, I couldn't get into 'This is not a love song', it's a brilliant movie, and there's a great storyline to it. I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much of the movie was left. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, which closes they depend on each other to get together in life. At the same time, I want the relationship to be more than what it is. Heaton is in love with spike, but Spike Ibsen is in love with Heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. The treacherous actions on both have great effect on the two men. They are both ruined by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
