The young lady is called Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently seems to live a fairly decent life, but suddenly it is inexplicable that it is mocked by her home and life of evil dude and the various and unhappy hankers. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a bunch of armed people are thinking of having her dead ... and she is going to die without knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I hear all the time. Now the content is so cheap to produce, and people can make their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be no one to ensure there is a quality standard! We're going to drown in shit! The only people who actually think of this are people who haven't seen any movies or read any books recently - because we are already making a death float in shit. It's people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who put the lie to these ignorant, so-and-sos by throwing $ 8K on the table and doing ... well, what I would say is a better action flick than anything you've seen in cinemas this year ... but you haven't seen any action flicks in the cinema this year. I've seen the ticket office. You stay away in cuddles. You'd better catch a copy of this, spend twenty minutes to be entertained, and continue your life. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. You enter, like Bonnie, with many questions, and where the whole thing ends up is nebulous. The whole creation has been done before in several ways, but not in such a compressed time and not without so concentrated tasty gunplay. You are there for the atmosphere, the mystery and the guns. That's it - it's all the filmmakers promise and they deliver. <br /> <br /> It warms my heart's black caves to believe it was made on such a budget. We pass a good number of indie films here, but rarely do we see anything as polished as it is short, and we have never seen one made in the action genre that looked so good. Hell, you could handle these two guys MI: 3 and it can make me see it. Bond franchise. Hell, something. No, actually better yet: I'd like to see these guys make a property on their own and get fucked away from Hollywood. Whatever is killing the movie industry is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> Best indie we've seen for a while and the most effective indie calling card we've ever seen. The DVD is $ 20 and has bonus features in the line. Go take your movie budget and put it towards this instead.
