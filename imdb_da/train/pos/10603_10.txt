I get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters who are constantly exposed to seeing Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It seems to be the same old tired comics that were repeatedly rehashed. Since my daughters couldn't get to the show this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just relax and rest for a while. I turned the TV on and in search of something else, I turned around the channels. My finger stopped the channel surfing the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I love every single thing this man has done, and when I saw that he was doing voice-over work for a little duck ... well, I couldn't change the channel! My daughters were immediately fascinated by the cartoon, and the more we looked at the show, the more I grew to love it along with the message depicted. It is not necessarily an advocate of "homosexual rights", but rather of anyone who has ever been proclaimed as a child to something. I had friends who were picked up for one thing or another .... too fat, for the skin, for feminine, for being a bully, not for being smart enough, only having a parent .... you called it! Children usually can be very very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually transferred a life message to its audience. My girls already accept others as they are and do not choose others to be different. My older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they are picked up (a single mother happens and the little girl is picked quite often - it warms my heart when Kassie stands up for her!). <Br /> <br /> So those of you who condemn this show because you feel it is a "gay rights lawyer" or are forced to "accept certain views" have completely missed the point of This exciting little cartoon. <br /> <br /> And if you need it explained to you .... Now you need more help than any TV show ever could offer.
