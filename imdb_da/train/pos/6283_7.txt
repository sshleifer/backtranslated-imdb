As much as I like big epic pictures - I save you the naming - it's great to kick with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. Film where the plot takes a back seat for the sets. Movies where the dialogue is not so well written that it binds in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of movies that fit the bill ... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares the image's ethos, but it's not quite that. What was good about the original has been streamlined. Whatever was streamlined, it was also enhanced thanks to a larger budget. Often these kinds of efforts are recipes for complete disaster - see the Italian job puggrimme recovery for one who blew it - but here thanks to a roll of most excellent actors, 60. <br /> <br /> The reason and much of the dialogue is not much to write IMDb about. You often have scenes where the same dialogue line goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will talk to different bends. A lot of people found this annoying; I find it raises a smile. Every actor gets the chance to show his or her definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the package of course (and it should be noted that it is also fun to see that Mrs Pitt has not received the first billing here). The chemistry between good Ol 'Saint Nick Stalwart (see date of review) and Angelina leads to a few good moments. The villain isn't even scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play hard guy roles before, so I know he can handle them, but I think he was intentionally instructed to make his role inconsistent as not to distract from the action. We know that the hero must succeed in some way; we just sit in the car with them and enjoy the trip. I think many of these scenes were played with the tongue so far in the cheek that it went over the head of many people, giving this a bad rating. In fact, I would not have thought of any of the fourth brakes on the camera. It's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All this style and not so much fabric - something that often exhausts my patience, if not executed * just * so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part it is. Wonderfully so. I noticed that using fast extreme close-ups for direct action seems to be a common trend these days. I personally find this kind of stuff exhausting. I prefer movies like this, where the stumps are impressive enough not to need artificial voltage ramp by rapping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many of the car jumpers as he could get rid of without losing his insurance (in fact, I mean - his character doesn't care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and it is used well in the slowly burning climate finale where he runs a Mustang in the ground at the most outlandish - and FUN - possible. <br /> <br /> So yes, this movie is not an "epic, life-conscious post-9/11 picture with mandatory social comments" effort. The pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut, and not all the actors hit the line. But car films rarely get better than this. So if you hate cars ... why do you read these comments yourself? <br /> <br /> I would take it over the many iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" any day. 10.7
