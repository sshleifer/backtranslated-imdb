<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I bugged my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for it in video about five years ago and finally revealing a copy at an online auction site, but I would like to see it either downloaded by a new distributor and re-released (I understand that the original video round was small) or has rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney, etc. and shown regularly. It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the struggle of life for a family of foxes in northern Japan, told by a wise old tree. The excellent soundtrack complements the film well. It would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offers for children's films today.
