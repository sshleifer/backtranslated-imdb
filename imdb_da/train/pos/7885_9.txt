First of all, I need to start this comment by saying that I'm a big nightmare on the Elm Street fan. I think it's the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who was trying to be the last chapter back, is a strange movie. It doesn't have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some believe it makes him less scary, which I agree with. And that is exactly the point. This movie exists so we can know Freddy a little better who he is, who he was, how he became the man who haunted our dreams. For some people this is a bad thing, it is better if we never know because it is scary not to know why evil is evil. Of course, these people will not like Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. To really enjoy this one, you need to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush in your dreamland and waiting to scare the hell out of you. This was the first one and it was fantastic. As the years went by, Freddy killed more and more people and no one could ever get rid of him for good. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's terrorism. Besides the story of Freddy's past, I also really liked the atmosphere in the film. No more children in Springwood, only crazy adults. Nightmare scenes are all good. The soundtrack is great, especially the opening song called '' I'm Awake Now '' by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can't believe it's so undervalued. Maybe it's misunderstood or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has many scary moments as well as fun moments as well, and many cameos! Get ready for something else and you may not be disappointed.
