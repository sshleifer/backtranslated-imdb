I have seen The Blob several times and is one of the better low-budget alien invasion films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an older man goes to investigate this. A strange jelly like fabric lays itself to one of its arms, and a young couple who saw the meteor land arriving on time and taking him to the local doctor, where the old one is so completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims, and the mass gets bigger. When these events are reported to the police, they do not believe in the young couple and accuse them of doing all this. They believe them finally when the mass, which is now huge, comes up in the city's cinema, and everyone runs into the streets that scream. It then settles for a dinner with the young couple and some others inside. Blob is stopped by spraying a lot of fire extinguishers onto it and it freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported by plane to the Arctic frozen waste and disposed of there. But it's only frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a typical setting for its period: teens and a small town. Blob has a good rock and roll style theme song in the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout. <br /> <br /> The sequel, beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988, but this is the best of The Blob movies. Cast is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> The Blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
