I very much enjoyed "The Revolution Is Not Removed". It once gave me a positive sense of how people have the opportunity to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. It is unfortunate that in Venezuela, the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all the decisions for the 80 percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. But when their coup failed after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the Ombudsman and the electoral committees and all civil rights, no plotters took off behind a barn and shot them. They haven't even gone to jail. The big plotters live in Florida and continue. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by a large majority of Venezuelan people. It's not just history that bites. Democracy can give you a hell if you let it go. And in Venezuela it is loose.
