I don't know if this is a sitcom or not, but I agree that this is one of the biggest TV shows ever. It's amazing that this still shows airs. And I love Michelle. It is sweet on the episodes when she was a baby and she spoke, and sometimes she said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show can be related to kids and teens and .. well, families as they struggle through hard times and try to work it out like a family. I don't know who would ever knock down an opportunity to see this show with anyone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode when I think her name is DD .. The older girl has stolen a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing. It was a big episode. An example of this TV show showing that the family is working as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
