This movie was last week and although the time of day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I couldn't turn off the TV. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. She does not come across as a very sympathetic character first, but sees the whole movie, you just want her so succeed. This movie really leaves you thinking. And I think that's pretty much because of Brooke Johnson's great play. I had never heard of her before or deliberately seen her in another movie, but it was great play. Compliments to Brooke. I hope to see her in another movie soon.
