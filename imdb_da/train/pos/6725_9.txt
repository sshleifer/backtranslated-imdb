Noll's comfortable way of spreading silent comments, often with explosives, to describe things that he is more aware of than most, is quite refreshing. There is another character in the movie that constantly tries to verbalize complicated problems by using more language than necessary. This guy should never have got a thesaurus. Cut to Zero and you know you're part of a treat! <br /> <br /> The way in which pioneer surfers are portrayed is very evocative of a "lost era". Never recall that no one knows how these guys lived, much less took care of issues like medical care. The use of old movie clips throughout was masterfully done.
