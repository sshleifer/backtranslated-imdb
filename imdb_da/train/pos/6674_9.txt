The first thing I thought after seeing "Mystery Men" was, how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so cute and fun that it is the status of a bomb that challenges logic. Now I hope that in the future it will be a cool hit, and you can count me with it's fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without giving away too much, this comic film makes what "Princess Bride" did for adventure and "Who hit Roger Rabbit?" made for classic cartoons. It should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the tone of the movie, as the Marketing Committee was unfortunately signed (this is one of the "Iron Giant" cases where the studio had no idea what it had on its hands). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little unfortunate. You will not hear BeeGees in the same light ever again.
