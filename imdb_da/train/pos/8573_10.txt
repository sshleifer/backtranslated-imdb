In 1996's "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil was arrested by London's Metropolitan Police (God bless them) to try to steal and murder 101 puppies - Dalmatians. All covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in "tin can." Now, 4 years later, she was unfortunately released from prison. I say it's about 28 years - in the dogs year !!!!! <br /> <br /> Then, in 2000, Disney decided to release a successor to the successful live-action version of the classic movie, and so called "102 Dalmatians." In it, there is a dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name I think; I should know, as it was recently shown on television recently), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) has fled again, she would have a bigger, better coat - made once again out of puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song from the 70's or so. And now we hear a bit of it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a great movie I keep thinking about - when will there be a "103 Dalmatians ???" LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
