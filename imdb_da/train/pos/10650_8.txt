I rented this movie over the past weekend, switched over the surround sound system, and got a good sound from special influences. This movie is a great movie rental, the special affects how enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed some so surprisingly computer generated. I didn't go to the cinema and watch it here, but it's a scary late night that doesn't want to go into movies. I would recommend it!
