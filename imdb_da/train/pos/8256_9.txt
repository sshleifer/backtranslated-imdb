Saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish and fun. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and up and comer, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Nice, I thought about the movie days after seeing it. <Br /> <br /> Authors, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie put themselves in a lot of political subtitles - but didn't hit your head with it. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth and sense. There is a dizzying carnivorous spirit to this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to cure grumpiness. <br /> <br /> Loved it !!!
