I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors, you will usually win me over. Homeward Bound did just that. They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin on it. It was a complete success. It is very much an archetypal movie. You have obi-wan from the group (shadow) who is clever and logical, you have the lovable but unbelievable and unpleasant chance, and the pricey princess who thinks she must be pampered and praised. These three personalities are very good at each other. I also like how they made the Chance and Sassy such dynamic signs, and they did not owe it. Most say that it may not be good because it is too much of a children's movie. What they forget, however, is that it must be a kids movie and it still does not take away from the accent movie. This is a great movie to see when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without the comics, an air bid movie with a better plot. I will no doubt advise you to see it.
