Forget the camp "religious" movies that have monopolized the TV / movie market ... this movie has a real sense of it. While it can be considered a movie that has cheap emotional traits, it also has the message of forgiveness and generally good morality. However, I did not like the lighting in this movie ... for a movie dealing with such a subject, it was too bright. I felt it removed from the film's overall appeal, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast and their notions counteract this oversight. </p> <p> Definitely worth watching ... buy the DVD.
