Making a book in a movie by following the story side by side is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically begin to make their own "mental movie" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress. And everyone's mind-eye opus is different, why when the "REAL" movie finally comes out, you'll always have a ticked segment of the movie's audience who is disappointed that it just doesn't measure up. <br /> <br /> Any scriptwriter and director can hope to achieve whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope it comes as close as possible to what their audience expects to see. /> <br /> There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novel Stephen King. When filmmakers take at least the essence of their stories, the results can be breathtaking and really scary (CARRIE, SALEM'S LOT, DE DEAD ZONE), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-horrible mess (Kubrick's version by THE SHINING; Miniseries for IT and TOMKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Although not even close to being the perfect King fit, PET SEMATARI has so many moments of just skin-and-bone deep discomfort that seemed to have blown on the screen directly from the book that you can basically forgive her shortcomings. For that we have to thank music video director Mary Lambert (she also instructed SIESTA, not even a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must see you having to put on your list) working from a manuscript of 'Manster' a self and probably one of his better. Since most of you know the story, I will not put you in bed with too much detail. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family to the perfect house in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two unpleasant little details: the dangerously busy stretch of the interstate highway out front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods back out. When Louis is a veterinarian and has a young child for a son ... Well, even if you haven't read the book, you need to do the fresh math. It's a royal story, after all, so no mystery where this is coming. <br /> <br /> It's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way. Some scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to trembling, screaming lives here: Rachel Creeds (STAR ​​TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrible memory of his unconditionally sick, pre-crooked sister; Louis meets with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; walk into the "other" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And the third act ... if it doesn't give you some nightmares, you might want to control your heart rate. Good performances by everyone here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-meaning neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in history, summarizing it all: "Sometimes death is better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louise's son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be damn almost impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a child age to seal the deal on this, Lambert and crew still made the best they could, and unfortunately Hughes was at that time just for amazing CUTE to "sell" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie when he performs, although the scenes where he is highlighted are still masterfully staged (especially Gwynne's death scene.) <br /> <br /> Otherwise, everything else is as good as it gets . CARRIE still has the title of Best King Adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATAR is right up there in the Top Five. <br /> <br /> Still, everything that is customized to the screen based on a king's book will be as scary as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely ... for now.
