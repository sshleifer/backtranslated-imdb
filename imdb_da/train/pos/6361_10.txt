I have eagerly anticipated the opening of this movie for months. Being a great Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph into Seuss's Grinch and make his character his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master of his trade, and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children, and this movie is sure to be a timeless classic for everyone to enjoy in the years to come. I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I will no doubt keep an eye on her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> It's clear movie, Jim Carrey has written all over, and I don't think it would have come together without him. However, the supportive casting was charming and entertaining in itself, especially the sweetest Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect foil for Carry's antics. Set design, musical scores and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product, and I think everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> Making a 22 minute comic classic for a full-length live action movie is not an easy experience, but Howard has succeeded in flying colors. For those critics who disagree, it may be your hearts that are two sizes too small.
