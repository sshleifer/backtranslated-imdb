This film contains the only ingredient that every revenge movie should have and that is true emotion. Grief, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this movie. From start to finish, this movie is incredibly captivating. The plot of paper sounds like the usual rubbish, which is mostly thrown into the audience's faces, but not confused, this film is powerful. Washington always presents a good performance. Plot in a nutshell: You suffer from depression, a young girl brings life into him, the children are kidnapped, you want revenge. It doesn't sound like anything special, but it's far better than any other similar movie out there. Currently, TAKEN is a similar film, but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone sets a good performance and the management is good. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is depicted brilliantly. The direction style was something I enjoyed and made the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you bring out once a year to watch again or a movie you want to ask you to see family and friends. From start to finish you are about the main character who makes it a roller coaster. There is enough to keep you happy, there is enough character development to please you, and then there is Washington to bring a smile to your face. Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed
