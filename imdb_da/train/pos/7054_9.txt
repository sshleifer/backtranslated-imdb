I thought this movie was much better than most film critics give it credit for. Although it has its confusing parts of the plot, it does not greatly affect your understanding of the movie. That said, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then it is probably not the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were excellent. Each character has their fun moments, and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughs all the way through. I thought the satire was a bit over the top in a particular area but it was deliberately done. John Cusack is right that even though it is set in the future, it really makes you see the present.
