This is a wonderful movie ... The first impression of cynicism and madness will soon be lost by a fun loving display of how men's and women's bases of motivation differ (Vive difference!) <br /> <br /> You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. People are rubbish really, but we have big hearts, and we try our best, despite the temptation. It's not our fault when sometimes the temptation can't resist it, it's just who we are. <br /> <br /> There is a consistent silence from start to finish; sharp photography and sharp composition, very comfortable viewing when adding provocative content, great music and laughing loudly scripting. <br /> <br /> Beware of the very young "lone wise voice" ... brilliant; wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from human condition.
