Yes it is an art ... to rather make a slow-paced thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in good numbers while you don't even notice it happening. <br /> <br /> Fine performance by Robin Williams. Sexuality angles in the movie may seem unnecessary and may affect how much you enjoy the movie. However, the core is very engaging. The movie doesn't shake you and still takes you enough to keep you broken. The direction is good. The use of light to achieve the desired influence on tension and unexpectedness is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice once see if you are looking to sit back and hear an exciting story!
