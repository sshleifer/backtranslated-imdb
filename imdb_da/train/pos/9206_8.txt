We do not come across movies on brother-sister relationships in Indian film or in any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects that are not used in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is depicted as a pile that can be used for ransom in climax. This film deals with the subject in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> It's inspired by George Eliot's novel "The Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, all good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and tired of society's unwritten rules. Despite this, the brother-sister's love is the winner. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the love of the two siblings separated in childhood and resuscitation of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the subdued brother's quest to reunite his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world. Although the film and novel are set about three centuries apart in two distant countries, the emotions are the same and still true.
