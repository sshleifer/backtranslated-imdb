I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought it had a theatrical feel to it, and it gave a chance that Collora could make a nice movie. This trailer didn't give me the same impression. The story line or potential story line was quite good, but because of the acting and special effects left me feeling this would have made a good TV movie or TV show. First, Michael O'Hearn is not as good a Superman. In fact, I thought in his short appearance he made a decent Clark Kent. Sorry, I'm just not thinking about SuperMan as the stupid. The Kent package had masked its size. Batman can have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman. Supes are toned without a doubt, but not bulk. Anyway, I didn't care about all his bags and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed cheezy. Now this may not be just O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to take some credit for poor scripting and direction. <br/> Second, the special effects for flight were cheezy. Superman flying through the sky. If it was clear that this Superman flew close to the ground, with telephone cables and buildings visible over him. I don't think there was any full body jump of Superman flying. Obviously, the belt and rigs supporting O'Hearn must have been placed on his lower torso. All in all, it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to watch a movie if I ever made it and would be sure to catch it on television. The story, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman, jealous of Lois's attraction to Wayne, Lex and the Twoface team to beat Superman and join forces between Batman & Superman is a good one. I'm sure with a bigger budget and approval for a full movie Collora and company, even O'Hearn could deliver a decent movie. Definitely one better than the most of the comic based crap that comes out of Hollywood lately.
