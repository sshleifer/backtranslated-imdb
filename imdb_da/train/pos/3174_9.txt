Very rarely do you come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The writer director has not only tackled the challenge of managing his own work, but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The manuscript takes an interesting look at not only the fighting author's situation, but blends so much comedy into the author's desolate world that one cannot help but commits to Ernie as a sign. Very funny stuff. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. He does not crush when it comes to making a good movie. I can't wait to see what he's coming next time. This guy can make people laugh and think; it is special.
