Dan, the widow of three girls, has her own council pillar that is likely to enter into syndication. After his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. When he didn't know any romance for some time, he didn't prepare for the meeting with the glorious Marie, at a local bookstore in a small town on Rhode Island, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his great family. Having wanted Marie at first glance, he prepares him a little when the beautiful woman appears on the family relationship. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. It is clear from the start that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we understand what the result will be, we go for the fun trip that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Sir. Hedges, a writer and screenwriter on his own, has given us two excellent novels, "What Eat Gilber Grapes" and "An Ocean in Iowa" and the Lovely Indie, "Piecer of April, which he also addressed. Both films deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche, Mr. Carell, in fact, continues to be In many ways, he recalls Jack Lemmon in his comedy and serious material, what to say about Ms. Binoche, an intelligent actress and a bright presence in any movie, she is about to make comedy and convince us Her only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture: John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan have nothing to do, they only serve as random music for decoration. Dane Cook, who's seeing T's brother Mitch is better off because he recites more lines than the others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a nice movie that will satisfy everyone.
