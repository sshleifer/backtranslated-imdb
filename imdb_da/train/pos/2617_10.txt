I saw the Lion King several times that all my friends put Togther. Have a baby sister .. you know how it is. Now I have remembered both the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out, I was like ok, let me see ... the other was considerably weaker ... so I saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2 ... I was like ok, we go again. Having seen 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitivity) were broken. A really nice and original plot keeps you glued to your place all the time. I noticed that the comic was filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao will use 100% here. I definitely recommend seeing the comic.
