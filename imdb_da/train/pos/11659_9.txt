This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is certainly one of the strangest subject ever for a movie: the 9th century creation of a famous illuminated manuscript, Kell's book. In this amazing story of this story, a prepubious boy named Brendan, who lives in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stack of abbot worried about preparing the monastery's defense from the imminent attack of the feared Vikings, must enter the ban around forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To accomplish this task, he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly adventure called Aisling. Greedy and delicate drawing at hand (there is some computer animation in a few key passages) in a way that will resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is mercilessly strange, But is a good strange, not of the off putting variety, but of the eye opening sort. If you were to nitpick - beyond some anachronism, like an African monk in the 9th century Ireland ?? One has to say that the mixture of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film never really mixes. And the comic relief is sometimes a little too wide. Therefore, I cannot give them the highest ranking. But these are minor issues with an otherwise lovely and extremely imaginative movie.
