The HG Wells story formula of the things to come was made into a movie in 1935. Very well made science fiction story of a war lasting decades. Great cast includes; Raymond Massey (arsenic and ancient lace) Sir Cedric Hardwick (Frankenstein's ghost) Ralph Richardson (time bandits) and Margaretta Scott. Annual glimpses of helicopters, holograms, a rocket ship and futuristic cities. This movie was ahead of its time. Led by William Cameron Menzies (invaders from March) it was very pleasingly much like previous movie metropolis (1927), but avoiding the so-called successor form of the things to come that were made in 1979. This film has nothing to do with original.hg wells as Jules Verne had a vision for the future with his stories. A classic science fiction movie.10 out of 10
