This is an old-fashioned fairytale yarn. I understand that with today's political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable. But this movement is not about politics. It's all about action, dialogue, camaraderie, action, direction, music and photography, and it's fantastic on all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is amazing. This is the ultimate buddy movie.
