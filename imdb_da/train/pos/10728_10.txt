The perfect spatial fantasy film. a group of children accidentally get into the room and have to come down again, but do it safely, they do. It wouldn't be a family movie if they all died. So it'll all be sad. You don't want Kate Capsaw, the leading lady giving a Golden Globe performance, but unfortunately she or Lea Thompson won one. It's so bad. I can't say enough, this movie is so big, Lea Thompson - gentleman, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated, and space camps were so undervalued. It should have been the other way <br /> <br /> excellent 10/10 0r maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
