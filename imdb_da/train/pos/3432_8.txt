This is one of those landmark films to be placed in the context of time. The plague was made in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and gross disturbance, not only for ordinary citizens of Estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations who were part of the powerful Soviet empire. It was in such an exciting climate that a youth country called Estonia was born. As newly created governments are known to encounter child problems, Estonia also faces many problems as some corrupt officials manipulated state machines to fill their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means. This is one of the film's core areas. The figure in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but it is made by a Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He has tried his best to infect so many possible doses of Estonian humor. That's why you can call it a comedy film of political undertones. As ordinary people are involved in this movie, we can say that this movie means good against evil. This is not a new concept, as it is readily available in most religious books of different faiths. Darkness in Talinn shows us how ordinary governments can also be overthrown by corrupt people. A nice movie to watch on a sunny day.
