Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority-led South Africa in the same way that Gandhi attempted to resist the British Empire's colonialism in India. Richard Attenborough's film Cry Freedom is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a crushing point of view, after Biko dies in prison from terrible behavior in the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books on Biko or let his wife played by Penelope Wilton push him to forget the books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard because the numbers escape across the border yarn after Biko's death. Oscar nominee Denzel Washington is good in only his fourth film as Biko, but there is something wrong in a movie trying to portray Apartheid's struggle by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half of the film. Attenborough would have earned his topic better by focusing on Biko's progress to prominence instead of beginning where Biko was friendship with Woods. Perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour movie wasn't exactly conducive to big box office, but the movie was still a huge box office flop. The film policy aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, albeit in PG sanitized fashion. *** of 4 stars.
