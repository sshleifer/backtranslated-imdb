Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can also have fun watching. Growing up in the 80s I enjoyed this movie, it's plot and all the actors. I recently purchased this movie on DVD, so when I have my own kids, they will be able to have such fun watching this movie as I did. The reason is fun, A group of children begin on a journey they had never expected as they were racked in the space by an overachieving robot. They were first in auh, but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to get it back panic, it dropped. Once they had restored enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life.
