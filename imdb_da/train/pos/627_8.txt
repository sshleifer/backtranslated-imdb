Aside from an eerie scene, this refreshing adventure fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical white that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that sharply moves this adventure pic. Apart from one of Robert DeNiro's scenes that do not come across smooth and synchronized with the tone of the rest of the movie, this delicious romantic adventure has a great storytelling and the powerful magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the easier Spiritual humor is well done. In the updated tradition of PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight out of ten stars.
