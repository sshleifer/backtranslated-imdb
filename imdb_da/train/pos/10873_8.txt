This movie deserves more recognition than getting it. It is truly an amazing and rich depiction of blood ties, favors and claims within the crime world. The film is shot beautifully and delves into all your classic crime themes such as treason and power. This movie is a movie goers movie, it requires attention and understanding and rewards in the end. It is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change rather than another lead frame fighting, martial arts epic, which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from Hong Kong and China. It has an arrangement of great characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to see it twice just to spy on what happened to some of the characters because they were so many interactions in the movie. All in all 8/10 Great plot characters, but there are signs that don't stand out enough and the music didn't make me go and sometimes I didn't feel well synchronized with the action (there is action by way) so it lose some points for it.
