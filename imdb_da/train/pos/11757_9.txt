Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play guys in their 30-year-old who put their marraige in danger by deciding (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to play their heartbreaking tie with rival Bakersfield years after that. Williams is ok, but Russell is flat like the legendary Taft quarterback Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive trip as Williams' wife who could live without this rematch. Movies are worth seeing just to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
