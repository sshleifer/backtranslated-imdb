I believe that the creator of this film's concept deserves much more recognition than they probably have ever received. Of course this is not an Oscar caliber film, but at least for me, this movie has left a lasting impression since I first saw it back in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I don't think it's (and doesn't hope) a spoiler, but: Imagine acting on your impulses. Do the first thought that pops into your head says the first words on your lips ... No restraint, no awareness, nothing keeps you from saying or doing the things that we as intelligent adults should not say or do . If anything, this film scratches the surface only - it doesn't go as far as it could go. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with recreating older "classics" to try money in today, it would not be nice to see them restore an older movie with modest success for the sake of takes it to the next level? A little further, or even investigating what the original crew member did not, would or could not handle 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion anyway. : O)
