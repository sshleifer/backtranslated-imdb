This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Each performance in this movie is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr Gyllenhaal wants a LOVELY film career if this is something to go by. I thought Joe Johnston was an odd choice as an instructor as he is usually associated with big budget blockers (Jumanji, Honey, I shrunk the kids). He pulls off every scene with pure class. My favorite scene was where Homer goes down into the mine arm and looks at the sky, goes down, as all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should lead several of these brilliant actress films as well as his Big Budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! to everyone involved in this masterpiece!
