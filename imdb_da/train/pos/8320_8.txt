Farrah Fawcett has used the better part of her post-English career confusing us, with an occasional remarkable play interposed between her Playboy frogs and Letterman escapades. But when it comes to that, one cannot deny that this girl can act. Far from a story of epic proportions, this well-known TV movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. Fawcett plays the crooked black sheep. Daughter comes home only to find out that she missed the last few days in her mother's life as well as the funeral, much to the chagrin of her more stable and probably more sensible sister. Brad Johnson plays the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of the telephony drama - but then there is always the confusing Farrah to see, and she actually remains very attentive. (And yes, I admit, I had the Farrah poster on my wall way back then). Silke Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) at Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud
