I see Cold Case because of the real life experiences depicted. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thank you, Merideth. All the characters are well-developed 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the US is far behind the developed countries of the world. Only this kind of honest factual experience and treatment influences the people. Of course, not all things look the same, but I am aware that 3/4 of the men who asked in the under 30 audience voted the same as me 10. You reach the hard - I will always reserve it " best episode "place for this episode. Continue to take chances and accept my in-depth gratitude.
