"Silverlake Life" is a documentary, and it was clear and straightforward. In fact, it was more like a home video, and if you want dramatic lighting, see something else. And it is by no means a tower chopper. But I mean that in positive ways. It shows two men who love each other and how to suffer from AIDS affects the quality of their everyday life. It's almost hard for me to say whether it was a quality movie or not because it was so dressed that I had to look for other ways to respond. It's an admirable movie, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes hollow wood productions on AIDS seem hip and heartless. These men made this film for themselves, which is one of the best reasons for creating something. The scene where Tom sings "You're my sunshine" to Mark and tells him goodbye is the right thing.
