Nobody really understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie flicks, but ?? frankly speaking ?? Why would we bother? Each and every movie in the Zombi "series" delivers fun, ugly gore and gratuitous shocks, and "Zombi 3" is no exception to this despite all the production issues encountered during recording. This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project, which was to further develop its "Zombi 2" success, but it ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei multi-error product and stolen ideas from previous films. The play is hopelessly inappropriate and ignores all forms of continuity, every brilliant idea of ​​George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crazies" repeated here shamelessly, and the imagined notions are truly miserable and painful to look at. Still, I didn't disturb you for a moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything! At a secret army-based base in Phillipines, scientists completed the bacterial war virus "Death One" and prepare it for transportation. After an erroneous attempt to steal the virus, the infected game of a terrorist is cremated, and the zombie box pollutes the entire population of a nearby tourist town. The last group of survivors must fight over hyperactive and inhuman strong zombies as well as white overalls soldiers who were instructed to kill anything moving in the polluted area. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzy's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations. For example, the undead birds were original and the whole zombies birth sequence at the deserted hospital was also pretty cool. The infamous flying main scene is almost as awful as it is ready to be, and it belongs perfectly to this cheesy and thoroughly pleasurable Italian zombie flick. Recommended for the fans; not against the negative reviews.
