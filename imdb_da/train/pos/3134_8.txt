This was a well-written tale of Making of the Batman Sitcom and actually reunited our heroes on a great quest and offering their television shows history. Unlike Brady's and the Partridge Family Documentary, we see not only the past and present life of Adam and Burt, but also see them back in action. Filled with Kapow's and catwomen and Riddler (s), Batman is back in a well-known tale that not only gives us a satisfying closure for the Batman series, but fills the modern fan with all the Hollywood stories that about those who have ' I've been heard for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
