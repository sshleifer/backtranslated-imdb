As one who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for several years, I believe that much of what was fiction told through true stories has been elevated to obscure philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> While entertaining, Fay Grim is another step in the Henry Fool mindset where the film reflects the quality of an object in the movie itself. In Henry Fool, the object is memoir ... In Fay Grim, the object is encrypted memoirs - which are themselves stolen, forged and transmitted to something so unclear that it can not really make sense - ie. scripting process writing and film making in the modern era - where most blockbuster movies are a little more than a mash-up of the past. It is in the philosophical sense what Fay Grim is about. The object is perhaps the tragedy that shock is now clich√© and boring (as suggested in the opening scene at the publisher's office). <br /> <br /> It is said that many of the movie's best points are lost if you do not understand Henry's character and the meaning of the memoirs being sought. Henry is a thinly blurred devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, etc. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of Fay Grims plot and history goes. <br /> <br /> And there aren't enough "details" expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing the Henry Fool's plot can't compare to "feeling" the quality of the characters you did in Henry Fool, and therefore I for a person who goes into this movie litter that there are about 10 minutes of 'so what' response to highly constructed dialogue and then it is. <br /> <br /> But Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley movie until I realized it was bad - crooked and attacked - precisely because Henry Fool's confessions were bad ... not just raunchy or dirty, but Inevitably broken. Henry can't even be a real villain - and that's perhaps the tragic mistake that makes him most contradictory ... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is unharmed. <br /> <br /> It doesn't come across in Fay Grim, though Henry's dialogue is excellent. What comes across is that the entire movie is structured as an encryption - a form of casting another plot around what ends up being another bad story to add to Henry's confessions. It's an interesting twist, but one that can't really be digested without seeing the first movie. Perhaps more Henry has proven to be better than having the publisher describe the basic film for the first movie - although this plot is not the first movie either - unless it is perhaps a casual observer. <br /> <br /> Part of the encryption? Hard to say ... a little disappointed with six gimmicks though. Cheap.
