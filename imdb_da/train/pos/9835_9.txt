Of the blocks just let me say I'm a huge zombie fan so I don't make statements like the above. Second, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie, and Fulci directed only 15 minutes before he delivered to Bruno (Rats, Night of Terror) Mattei. These are no Dawn of the Dead people. <br /> <br /> That said, this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Scripture is wonderfully horrible. Just check out the two researchers trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> The zombies come in all varieties. From mounts to machete-wielding maniacs, to birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is plentiful. The legs are bitten, arms amputated, the stomach burst open. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast flying from a zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> Then there's the head in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments in horror since Ash got her hand occupied in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you are the kind of person who will like this kind of movie. Get some friends and a little beer and you will be in a fun night. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
