Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search of their targets; a slimy South American lawyer and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> Moderate success in building an exciting atmosphere, Sniper in most accounts is a very solid thriller, it takes time to set up its characters and their situation and climax in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful in maintaining the gloomy mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; Some detours here do not add up to much. But this movie is far better than his Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiring, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture. He can do these kinds of roles in his sleep, and he is very convincing here, reprising the role twice more directly to DVD sequels.
