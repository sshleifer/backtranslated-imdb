So Fox raised the plug between a drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How boring is it? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what is happening? Why didn't the remaining already filmed episodes broadcast in the United States? They were sent elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening? This was a good show, but you left us hanging. If you are going to introduce new drama / mysteries, at least air a conclusion before suddenly ending the middle theme. Every time something like this happens (and it seems to happen a lot with you - that is, Fox), several of them will "wait and see" before investing their time. That means you will see an artificially low interest share and are more likely to end the series. See? It's a vicious circle. Let's not go back ...
