This movie was one of my childhood favorites, and I have to say that, unlike some other movies, I liked during the time the Thief of the Background has held onto the quality I grew up. This is not just a movie that can be enjoyed by children, it can also be seen and enjoyed by adults. The only drawback is that you cannot look past the "bad" effects (in relation to the effects today) as you could when you were a child. I remembered none of these effects, of course it had been about ten years since I had seen this movie when I was about eleven years old. Who then looks at effects? One only seeks good stories and entertainment, and that is exactly what this film provides. In my opinion, this film is one of the first major adventure films of the 20th century. Come to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones movies are right like this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure all that creates a wonderful mix that will catch you from the beginning to the end, and even though the movie is old and the movie's music and style is clearly not modern, it does not succeed in being dusty and old. All of this is mainly due to the great story, the good instructions and the actors' good acting. In that department, Sabu (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar) stand out, giving most of the movie's comic and chilling elements. Fantastic movie and although an 'oldie', definitely a 'goldie'. I hope someone has the brain and the courage to release it on DVD one day. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
