Antonioni was heading for another hip masterpiece, this time across the Atlantic than "Blow Up". It was not the success of critics and young people like the one before. Why? Maybe because it was a European view of America filled with clich√©s that didn't work then and it hasn't been good. (The revolutionary students in the beginning are embarrassing.) <br /> Perhaps when it was released, large movie blocking films and those specific to the youth market were dated. If it had been released a year before, hippos in deserts could have been fresh ... It's a very interesting movie, very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antony scenes between, like the love making in the desert, the silence of the desert mansion and the explosive end ... That the leaders were two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshedte is a little better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with decent actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite fun and exciting at times, you didn't want to know how the lines are delivered ... A very intersting document of the late sixties is definitely worth looking at after photography and soundtracks.
