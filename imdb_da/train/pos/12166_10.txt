A very strange and convincing film. It's about a very awkward and tightly wounded man who tries to navigate his life as a door to door fundraiser / seller. The director was able to capture a very unpleasant tone that really served the story well. Original and disturbing and at the same time find a lot of humor in the pain that comes with life. There is a sequence in a test center that really stood out and made me laugh loudly, which is not something I do as often as I should. One of the more memorable movies I've seen for a long time. Haven't thought, and I'm looking forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Amazing performances all around. The simple line "I really appreciate it." is now iconic to me.
