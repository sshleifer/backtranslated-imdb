I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I enjoyed so much in the movie. Two days before the film premiere, I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie, and I thought I had it all. I was wrong: instead of a good movie, I helped a great one! I filmed the movie. it was boring .. it was fun .. but most of all pictured LOVE .. i dont even start to describe the soundtrack .. so i dont want :) i am not a film critic .. i can't describe it in several words .. my kind of vague description is all because the play left me speechless. thank god for the keyboard :) thank you tudor giurgiu roof thanks mari popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila Encore! :)
