Bela made 9 pictures for Monogram, but it was only on THIS, the 4th that things began to come together. All in all, using this as the essential template for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the series will also deal with an important theme: A scientist (usually Bela) makes experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes in the basement of the old house) that causes things to flourish. It was also the first time that art director Dave Milton got a chance to spread his wings. He boarded BLACK DRAGONS, the girl before, but THIS is where he gets his craft to start clicking. Lewis made a good mood for nothing and was around for the rest of the monograms. Casting is the key in these, and it's a really good B-movie, here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS) along with Russell, who would star in Lewton's CAT PEOPLE movie ... And Rosetto from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a lovely piece of poverty speech. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... it sums up everything they had learned to this point and gives you something to compare the rest with. The plot? Bela steals glandular juices to keep her uncomfortable wife young. They like to sleep in coffins. If you can read it and smile, the rest will be easy.
