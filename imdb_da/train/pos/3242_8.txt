I watched this movie with my father. I must have been pretty young, about 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon. The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell that these robbers were together for a score. It really took off after the first half hour. All the actors are good, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I guess it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters are trying to handle a very strange score. The whispers are not corny, but they are subtle and extreme at the same time making them so fun. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
