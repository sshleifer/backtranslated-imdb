Just looked at this movie on DVD and thought the play was very good, but it all over the story left much to be desired. This film has the same structure and look of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that people can live this type of lifestyle; on the genital area of ​​society where their overall existence is based on hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or something, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is excellent in his role as "burnt out" former porn star John Holmes. The support molding is just as good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing and depressing movie. The murder was brutal, but also the daily life of these people was brutal. Unless you're interested in these murders or were a fan of John Holmes, it's really not a movie to watch. If you want to see a docu drama on murder, Truman Capote's 1960s in Cold Blood with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are much better.
