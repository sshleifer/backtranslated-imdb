When I saw the Exterminators in the year 3000 the first time, I had no expectations for that movie. Although it wasn't as bad as I thought. It's a kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with cast that is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story are Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of the Zombie Meat Eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see the child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the Living Dead AKA Gates of Hell) as John Robbins and in Cannibal Apocalypse as the role of Maria's brother. Completely entertaining movie, with some boring parts.
