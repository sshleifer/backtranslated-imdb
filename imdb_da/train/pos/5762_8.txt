I must admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them, I see them all. Fear especially. My friends and I gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy ties, order a pizza and have a blast. This one had a large box so I expected less than normal. The story is about a housing project built over a nuclear plant that has had the above layers bulldozed, and the second underground layer is simply covered. The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered facility when some children fall into a hole in a hole. This awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point it is chunk-city. Good effects and action never stop until the final credits roll. Okay, it's not great art, but the one with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top cruel stuff was our favorite of the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party bands" I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. And you could tell it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild ride.
