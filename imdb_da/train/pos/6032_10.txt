Antonioni really showed some "cojones" when he made this movie. He went to America, working under a contract from the most lavish studio (MGM), and he made the most amazing portrait of the American community I have ever seen. Having seen LA first hand, this is the most accurate depiction of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial of the studio is understandable, after such a large investment and poor return. It's boring that people don't see this movie any more, because I think Antonioni has been proven right. Here he expects the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of the living space in the inhospitable (but beautiful) desert and beyond. How I would love to see the interest in this movie's resurgence and a sumptuous DVD release. I ask people to see Zabriskie Point with open mind and open heart. We have a really unique movie that comments on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
