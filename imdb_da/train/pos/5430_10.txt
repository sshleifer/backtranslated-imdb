Of all the British imperial films such as. Four Feathers, the Charge of Light Brigade, distinguishes this film as the crop of the crop. It reflects a time when "the sun never settled on the British Empire." Get over it. I will not go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that make this movie great. I have visited the Alabama Hills and have photographed the pass through which the British marched and it remains as it was, unchanged by the time and interference of men and vandals. And even though I know it's coming, your lying dead looks at a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, yours! Your! Your! <br /> <br /> You Lazarushian - Leather Swing Your! <br /> <br /> Although I have belted you and braided you, <br /> <br /> At the Gawd of Life that made you, <br /> <br /> You're a Better man than I am, Swing Your "<br /> <br /> I'm still 54 years old, getting misty eyed, and anyone who says they're not a liar. The range of emotions within it is the nature of a fantastic movie. Like the end of another great movie, Of Mouse and Men.
