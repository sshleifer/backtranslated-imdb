Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay in the '40s and years before. And I mean that in a positive way, since I'm certainly not a Bay hater. His films are simply high-quality entertainment, just as the Raoul Walsh films were in his days. "Gentleman Jim" is good quality entertainment. Besides a first-class instructor, it also has a first class cast, with Raoul Walsh's regular leader Errol Flynn in the body. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the boxing games were brought on the screen. They used some very dynamic cameras which also really made boxing matches uplifting and exciting to see, with the final championship match against John L. Sullivan as the ultimate highlight. Of course, the biopics of the '40s and earlier were still very different from the biographies that were made this present. Modern biographies often harden their majors and show his / her life from basically birth to death and everything, most emotional aspects. 'Old' biopics were just the same as movies that were not based on real people, which also meant that the filmmakers would often use a lot of creative freedom with the character of the main character and events that happened in his / her life. This film is also not just a biography of a boxing legend, but also represents a splendid depiction of the period during which illegal naked bone struggles entered the modern era of boxing. Errol Flynn does a great job depicting the real-life famous boxer James J. Corbett aka gentleman Jim. Not too many people knew, but Flynn did some really good plays in the 40s, of which this film is one. Physically, he also looks in top form. He also looks very different without noticing his little beard in this movie. The film also features some fine supporting actors and some fine actors throughout. <br /> <br /> An amazing and entertaining movie that still really keeps up really good today. <br/> <br /> 8/10
