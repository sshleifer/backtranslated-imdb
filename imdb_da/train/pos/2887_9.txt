Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films, one of the movies I think you appreciate, the more older you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic adventure. I consider the movie to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release. The characters became more dimensional than previous films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest figures Disney ever created. With her kindness and dash of dry humor, she is extremely sympathetic; But that is the inspiration she gives that makes her memorable. Like many people, she is an endless dream, and she holds on to her dreams and never gives up. Even in the most unfavorable situations, her dreams endure and she will not let anyone take it away from her. Her example should serve as an inspiration to everyone, and encouragement to never let go of your dreams.
