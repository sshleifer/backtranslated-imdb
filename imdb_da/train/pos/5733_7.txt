I'll tip the scales here a little and say I enjoyed it here. However, the comic will really only appeal to those who have very absurd tendencies. It is certainly something that most people will not get, just as absurdism is. <br /> <br /> The animation is horrible, but yes it is supposed to. The protagonist is scary, violent and stupid. no redeeming properties at all. His wife screams and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories lack any kind of point. <br /> <br /> But again, it is meant;) <br /> <br /> If not sequiters, foul language and complete and complete coincidence are your things you will love this. <br /> <br /> It's really short so I'd probably rent instead of buying.
