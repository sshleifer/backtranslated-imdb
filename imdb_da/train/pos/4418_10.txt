Saw it at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe that this is a first-time instructor and all kudos to Harvey Keitel again to take a risk and embark on a limb for a script he liked. <br /> <br /> Totally reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director about the revolution's turn in Cuba. But don't expect this to be a film about the revolution, it's political attitude is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the instructors obvious love of movie history (a great "hosting Thief" tribute) and some moody scenes that work without being pretentious. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
