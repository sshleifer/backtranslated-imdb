Although I generally don't like remakes to think that remakes are a waste of time; This movie is an exception. In fact, I didn't know that long before I read the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is only about the actual movie and not a comparison. The story and the way it is written is no question: it is Capote. There is no need for more words. Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts games are amazing. I've seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they are good actors, and in the case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is number 1 famous star and not her brother. This time, this security is raised to the facts, no doubt. His game, as well as Edwards player is clearly the top of their entire business. I recommend this movie to be on your top 50 movies to watch and keep on your DVD shelves.
