I desperately need it on a tape, not a DVD, and soon! I have a nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet triggered, even though he sat down to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved stepson in Ramadi Iraq on 9-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone. I have another nephew who enters the army as soon as he is educated from high school in the spring because, as his older brother, he has some idealized and romanticized ideas of what is serving in the military. My stepson died after just 10 days in the country and he never went on any missions so my nephews have no way to refer to any of the experiences shown in this sincere documentary from any kind of personal experience that could have been conveyed by my now deceased son. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do with those who are in or now gone, but I have one back who has not raised his hand and been sworn in YET. I desperately want him so informed that none of the others did. <br /> <br /> Pleasures help me with that. <br /> <br /> The film director Ground Truth is the best visual reference I've ever seen. I have to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he's getting into before it's too late. BUT: (don't laugh) I need my mother to see this first. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not just the idea of ​​them, but the truth about what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. Then she will have the emotional willingness to get my brother to look at this movie, and when he does, he can also make his son, my youngest nephew, see it. Then my nephew can start taking this seriously. <br /> <br /> ((Is there another time since this will be shown on TV? If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> But my problem is, my mother doesn't own a dvd player, she still uses video (is it correct? with tape?) so i need to find a way for her to watch this movie. Can I buy this from someone in that form? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from someone? Is there any legitimate link that I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so, who would I contact. I would like to pay for the privilege if it is a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> If you have other ideas, I will consider everything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I've lost a very precious loved one and already loved, I already know that my eldest nephew will never be the same when he returns, and I can also lose him . I can't lose three and the emotional toll for all those who make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. Please help me. I would like to call you, email me a number if it is the best way to get the necessary information. Thank you very much for any help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
