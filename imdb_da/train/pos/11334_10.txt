I would say that this film provides an insight into the trauma that a young mind can confront when a family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I would highly recommend this movie especially to parents or people planning to have a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters to be appealing and very sympathetic from a variety of dimensions. <br /> <br /> scary monster, though not scary for most adults, has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child facing unknown terrors can create. <br /> <br /> I found the movie to be great!
