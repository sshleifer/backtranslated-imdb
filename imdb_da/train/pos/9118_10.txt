I watched this movie with a special screening of Owen Alik Shahada's work. It's so interesting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the most important independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers I talk about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea of ​​something bears witness to the diversity and variety of African themes, with its film 500 years later it is an African problem. But the idea does not fit that mold. Shows the artistic diversity. The film is an African cast, but the subject is a human subject that most of us could relate to. I just love the gentle comedy in it. And the Kora of Tunde Hunted is just amazing, it's really an artificial gem.
