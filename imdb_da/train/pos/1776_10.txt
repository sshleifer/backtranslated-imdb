I hated the first episode of this show ('Protesting Hippies') so much in 1999 that I scolded the rest. But when it came to 'The Paramount Comedy Channel', I saw it fully and to my surprise found it fun (Motto: Never judge a comedy series in its first week)! <br /> <br /> Seen in 1969, 'Hippies' stars Simon Pegg as 'Ray Purbbs', editor of an 'Oz' like underground magazine called 'Mouth'. His friends are the feminist Jill, the reclining Alex, and the half man Hugo. Back in the late 60s, there was a sense of incredible optimism among the young that they could change the world through the printing of magazines that nobody read. Instead of sniffing on the hippies' naivety, 'Hippies' are loving to it. Arthur Mathews' scripts parody parody a series of era icons - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous' Oz 'obscenity test from the early 70s. Excellent performances from the cast; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' reminded me of the Richard O'Sullivan character from 'Man About The House'. It's a shame that there was never another series, possibly because of people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', try it. When you get past the deep opener, you're out for a treat!
