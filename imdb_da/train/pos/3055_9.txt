In his first visit as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell whips a needy yarn, which is all permeable, relational marriage issues with melancholy authenticity, and lacing it with an equally absorbing subplot of a dangerous hit man's business. The film is controlled astutely and consists of a wonderfully composed cast as well as a fast, family-conscious manuscript (also by Brommell) that brings life to an otherwise tired genre. As a bonus, "Panic" delivers subtle, accent humor - an unexpected, unimaginably charming and very welcome surprise through its bumbling, unsure of itself, low key star, whose still cool state enticing, especially given its line of work . The eternally great William H. Macy again captures our hearts as Alex, an unhappy, torn, medieval man and father who finds comfort in the most dubious of people: a young, attractive, 23-year-old, named Sarah (Neve Campbell ), which he meets in the waiting room of a psychologist's office awaiting therapy by Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss his growing zeal for completing the family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built. Alex, whose desire to lead a new life, is prevented by the fear of disappointing his dictating father, hitting an unwise fancy to Sarah, who ultimately leads him to understand the essence and undeniable responsibility of being a man for his wife and more important than he, a good father to his six-year-old son, Sammy (the game enthusiastically by the end-David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> Henry Brommell's brilliant 'Panic' is rarely seen in Hollywood, rarely seen (with the 2002 Road to Perdition exception) since its view in 2000? it weaves two conflicting genres (organized crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm hunk with movie show that is evenly strong in both directions ?? It is one that will maintain its unusual, rare caliber and shining sincerity in the years to come.
