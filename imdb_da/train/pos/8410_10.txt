In this truly fascinating dark film, a young poor student sells his soul to the devil for much money. On the other hand, the devil takes his mirror image (it is done brilliantly in the film and annoyed the presidency when Balduin, the student is formerly practicing the sword in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man of war with himself" expressing his near future . The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is not available (he has made a covenant with the devil, he is cut off forever from love and other wealth of the soul) you can have love, or you can exchange your soul for money, You can't have both. Balduin is haunted by his dual (intertitles express this beautifully, as does the action. Some of the scenes are incredible, the feeling of emotion, when the devil disappears with the mirror of Balduin, is amazing, just like the sense that his covenant has always cut him away from it human society (the scene where he runs away from his dual and ends in the "wilderness" at the edge of the city, no longer entirely human (he has lost his soul) he is like a hunting animal outside the human community There is So many other things to say about this incredible movie, Paul Wegener was a great actor and instructor, a cultural hero, who helps if you know a little about German history at the time this movie was made and about German doppelganger Tradition (not google it, get a proper book) Just remember it's a very early movie, it's a bit clumsy at times, but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale, it's one of the best enough lonely (yes it is!)
