This was one of the best shows ever made for television. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists. Compulsive display. I was lucky I saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode wrong, I can't remember, but it was at least on a regular basis every week. My boyfriend and I were hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is usually a big fan of American series normally. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We missed a few episodes and it made you sad and sad for a week missed them lol. Great casting, great play. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black became a great achievement for a child, and Paige Turco was also her best ever since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course like the Sheriff's long suffering sidekick. Yes, there were some confusing and confusing bits that I suppose would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. It made the end weak and you could tell they had killed it. Did we go, what? Why did they do it with one of the best shows ever? Shoot exec.
