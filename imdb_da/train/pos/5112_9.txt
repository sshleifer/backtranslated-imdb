This movie has everything, action, battle, dance, bullies, music, beautiful girls. This film is an authenic look at Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Lots of oil money, lots of women and lots of honky tonks. Too bad they are all gone now. The movie is basically just another boy meet girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no movie with better music like this movie and it includes American Graffiti. It's a movie I see over and over and never get tired of it. Every time I look at it, I'm young again and it's time to go out with honky tonking. The only reason I only gave it a 9 is because you can't judge a movie zero, I don't feel you should judge a 10.
