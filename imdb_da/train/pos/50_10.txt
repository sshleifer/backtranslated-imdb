My kids just stopped in this movie the other night, and when things started to play out, it became really interested in my interest. I had to go to the bowling league so I got them to register it for me on the DVR so I could see the rest later. Well, I just finished seeing it and the shape of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets. It was an excellent movie, though I could almost feel the pain and anxiety these girls experienced. And I would never have guessed the reason why Alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth for a million years. This was probably why my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. Also I wouldn't have searched for this movie, but I'm sure I saw it. Very moving, very moving. Perfect for those who love a good drama or tears.
