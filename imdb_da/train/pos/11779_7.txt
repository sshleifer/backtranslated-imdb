After reading Diamonds book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but overall it is quite informative. When reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'cultural warriors' are hard at work, seeing attacks on 'Western Civilization' under each rug. Is Diamond a little preaching? Of course. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'weapons, bacteria and steel' to seemingly any option in the series. We'll get it after the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series)? Of course. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly entertaining, condensing a very long, complicated story down to "cups, swords and horses" that wraps the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things have actually contributed (but not fully defined) the reasons for Spain's success against the established cultures. Is he preaching * against * Western civilization in any way? Nix. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a big role in determining which cultures were accelerated faster, * not * the luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you are looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that influence how societies succeed or fail, this series provides a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.
