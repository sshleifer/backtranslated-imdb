Brilliant movie, the second best movie for The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS, and I haven't seen this movie for 15 years, but still as good as it was then. The action was horrible, and the duplication was even worse, but it's the features that make this movie (and many other old-fashioned Chinese kung-fu movies) great. The choreography is amazing and the story is basic. I've never seen the 36th chamber of Shaolin, but know it's the same movie, but Gordon Liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr Back to 36. Chambers are played by a different character. It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.
