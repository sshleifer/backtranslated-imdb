My discovery of the cinema by Jan Svankmajer opened My eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. Hans Ruka is one of the finest, most technically impressive animated movies I've ever seen. A potter wakes and dangers his plant. Then he goes to make a pot. But in it comes the big hand that crashes the pot and requires the pot to make a statue by itself. He throws his hand out, but soon he returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he is forced to sculpt a stone hand. He sits down on it, fainting out exhaustion, but eventually ending the task. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful order of the metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet string, which keeps him cramped, and he escapes home. He closes in and is accidentally knocked down by his own beloved plant when it falls on its head. <br /> <br /> This movie does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic (why?). For example, the hand is clearly a person's hand in a glove. Everything else is laughing. Strings are visible and are part of the story, making it a precursor to the movie Strings. The atmosphere is scary: the hand that goes after the little potty managed to infuse more fear into me than many horror movies combined. <br /> <br /> The movie is obvious but it avoids being completely manipulative for its simplicity. It is a fate of artistic freedom and tyranny that cannot help win the heart and mind of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
