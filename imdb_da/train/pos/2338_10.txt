Many of these other viewers complain that history has already been tried. It may be that, but the addition of the narrator and Dr.Suess as a scenery makes this show a must watch. With adult insinuation throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is both reminiscent and refreshing. The investigative part of the show is not what draws viewers in. The twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this apparent paradise are what loyal viewers come back to for more. This is a success that ABC should never let go of. Bravo ABC. LOST was old, way to revive prime time. 9 episodes before the authors strike left the audience want more.
