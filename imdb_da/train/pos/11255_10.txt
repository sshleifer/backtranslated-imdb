This is undoubtedly my favorite Le Carre novel, and it has been transformed into the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for. I read a review on this site that seems to find the signs noisy, but I think it's missing out. All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories, and that is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. Treason is the key of all to the benefit of none. Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it fun to watch. Peter Egan is in his finest role and the late regretted Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are spot on. This cast is a Theater Impresario's Dream. The story should not be spoiled by poorly informed description, but it suffices to say that it concerns a young man's slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason. All my sympathies lie with Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love of poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - just as wonderful as ever. His only true friendship, but also by Definition, another in the long forgery. OUTSTANDING! Rent it, Buy it, love it.
