I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show manages to put a smile on my face with its amazing storytelling, witty dialogue and great acting. But that's not all: it also manages to stick to the end. The basic idea behind the show - Bringing people back to life with a single touch, ending with the undead status by one second - is interesting and could still be in later seasons. But the exciting murder cases, the unique appearance of the show and the talented narrator add to the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than it's parts. It has some charm that I really enjoy and I look forward to joining Ned and Chuck's world for another season.
