Despite the budget constraints, this is a great movie that ensures effort and imagination can overcome cash shortages. The opening, where hollow paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs survived at least in the age of mankind, is a lovely red herring. Then a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat, which in turn causes the decoration of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps showing the cave paintings instead of this not the first time, something has happened). When the prehistoric animal appears, it is a well-animated Plesiosaur, which soon causes disappearance in the local area. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still true entertainment for monster movie fans.
