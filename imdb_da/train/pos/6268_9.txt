Carter Wong plays a precious hero on a quest for a book of healing that leads him to find the ultimate revenge! Pacing is good in this movie, and there are many battle scenes to keep the movie going. The flying guillotines look evil, and the biggest villain has no trouble using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and finally draws you (which I felt might have had a successor). Campy and dark, it's lovely ol skool kung fu !!
