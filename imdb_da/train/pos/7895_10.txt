In the opening scene of this movie, a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights. This must have been very hep in 1936, but it was right out and had nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood didn't look as far as I could see. But Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", 87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped tormenting or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so-called bathing suit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase", '46. Daisey even suggested marriage to Johnny in a ferris wheel on his head and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a good couple, assuming to be very rich and the other a very bad reporter. Off stage, Davis and Brent had a really cunning love affair, which is a good reason why there were sparks as these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
