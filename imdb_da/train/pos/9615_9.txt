This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where Chaos Theory is summed up by telling about a butterfly's wings that cause a tornado across the planet. Well, Bug is about it (or at least something, don't worry, it's no spoiler) I'm certainly not a religious type and don't believe in predetermined things, fate, etc. But this movie certainly makes you wonder if chance really exists ... more, the actor and camera are also excellent, another shows that it is still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
