An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. I remember it very well from my childhood, it was fun and sad and very beautiful. Now it starts a little dark, a dog that escaped the pound, and is killed by an old friend, ending up in the sky and coming back. But it turns out sweet when he turns to an orphan who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary as opposed to other cartoons, like Charlie's dream sequence, but everything was okay and the songs were reasonable. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love that guy, dehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaw's Revenge, God must rest his soul, poor girl, she deserves not to die, but she is in heaven now, all good people go to heaven. All in all, this is a very good animated movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have the original video of this, you will find the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, should love that guy, dehehehe.
