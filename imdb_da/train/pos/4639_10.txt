I got this a couple of weeks ago and love it! It is modern, light but full of real complexities in life. It questions and answers, like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi & Jagger. These pictures are much more universal than just the bubbles we can live in. You don't have to be Jewish or gay to enjoy this - I'm not, but the movie goes straight to my top ten movies. First, it looks like pure entertainment, but it makes you think further. Relationships we must live with are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, you are called. You do not know what is coming, and you certainly do not know where this story is going while you are seeing it for the first time. It is worth seeing several times. Foxfilm includes big bonus material - here is a great music video and "production of" (including explanation of the title, interviewing Lior Ashknenazi, who plays in the movie and Arabs with doubts about the Israeli lifestyles).
