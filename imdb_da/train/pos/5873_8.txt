This would have been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost any other for John Abraham. This guy is a horrible actor. It's comedy, drama, tear pipes, etc. He stinks. It looked as if Priyadarshan at one point realized it too, and he had basically him as a monkey to make his solo scenes fun. He is the only noticeable drawback (there are a few more annoying time-bits) of a totally scary movie otherwise. Best comedy to get together in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy worn on the shoulders of a brilliant manuscript and of course Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. He is better at being a shoe for the best comedian on every price function. AK has always been good at comedy, but he takes it to another level here. Body language, facial expressions and the way he delivers each line. It is a genius achievement. The packed theater went on virtually the entire length of the movie, and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the US. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have a "lead" heroine. It stars 3 amazing HOT + beautiful girls, which I thought did a pretty good job. Almost sure they all make their debut. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine bears himself after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self (sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely worth the decho. I would say it is FUNNIER than No Entry, and that says a lot. Could have been even better if they had chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
