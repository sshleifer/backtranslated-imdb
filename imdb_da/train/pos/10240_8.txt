Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus. Main characters: Rex Tyrannosaurus Rex, Elsa Pterodactyl, Dweeb Parasarolophus, Ooo Triceratops, A boy named Louis, a girl called Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the Clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa), etc.? What happens: Four dinosaurs "brain grain cereal" and are now cozy, friendly dinosaurs that will be nice to children. They go into New York, with big plans ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated movie. The dinosaurs' animation, when they go seedy and friendly, is a little floppy and not so good, but they look pleasant in the same way. I like the dinosaurs when they are cozy and friendly, they are cozy, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characterized characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I also like the others. Overall, I like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People who like good children's animated movies, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think the circuses are not always what they think? Enjoy! :-)
