A surprisingly good comedy was the little British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". It marks the first mating of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon before the tiny film of uncontrollable passion of 19th-century English ants. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suitable for scrubbing comedies, it all flows fine together. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in the priggish divorce lawyer Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite using an unpleasant English mist prevention journey. She does everything to annoy him - but in the crazy way, the movies he falls for her. And she falls for him. But a serious case of erroneous identity arises when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all she leaves Oliver in a note) considered Olivier to be a married woman. To make matters worse and more entertaining, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, who wants divorce from his wife, whom dear Larry believes must be Oberon! There is a nice dialogue between gender issues and fun sexual exploration. You can see that Olivier is not too sure about the comedy, but in genuine Olivier he is a complete professional and delivers. And he handles the clamp and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. Oberon was not a big shake as an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite their reputable screen model, she was fine with Olivier. This was filmed in the early Technicolor, which looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the print should clear up.
