"Citizen X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov", nickname for a fierce and perverted Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea), who at times pursued the killer against all odds in the light of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self-service and practical denial. An HBO product for t.v., gives the film a solid cast, good performances, saves the audience much of the pig's details, but plays like a docudrama that sees the style of similar Hollywood ticket. An even and even dramatization of a serious and relatively little known story more interesting than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
