A good picture is worth all the words. This movie has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of people with Down syndrome. And I won't spoil it by telling you. You want to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is a great actor. I didn't have to understand a single word he said to understand his opinion. <br /> <br /> The movie has a magic of its own. Having seen it, I understood better that we put too much value on performance and not enough on the people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
