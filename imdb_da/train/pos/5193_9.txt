The sword fight was out of this world, fighting scenes spectacular without flying on a wire technique (until the end) that is far too common today. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the movie. The signs of the attack on the evil houses were clich√©, but the movie is comfortable with it. An injection of humor from Woo. The plot with its twists was unpredictable and exciting, and you could not tell who was good or bad or which side people were on. <br /> <br /> A good sense of excitement and well-defined surprises. The depth of the story is quite intense for a fleeting movie of this genre and reaches you in ways that most kung-fu flicks do not.
