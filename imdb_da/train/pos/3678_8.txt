It's a very nice movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. but there are 2 minus points: - The story level has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very nice and some are just boring. - many stories are not self-contained (if you compare with coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or you will call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are amazing and overall it is one of the best movies this year for sure! <br /> <br /> annoyingly, I have to fill 10 lines in minimum, I have no more to say and I don't want to start analyzing the individual sequences ... well, I think that's it!
