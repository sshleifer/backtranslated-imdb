I was blown away by the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears in more than one occasion. A hardened sci-fi fan, I like to believe I can choose the good stuff from BS and that was good stuff. <br /> <br /> As such, when I first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago, I got a sick feeling in my gut. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be recycled in Caprica, which would not work at all. BSG's story, of a sadly ragged band of survivors, captured aboard dilapidated starships and ruled by prophetic vision and a series of pseudomiracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica depicts the civilization of the cold and decadent flourishing time. The overall mood I got from Caprica resembled the minority report minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In true BSG form, during the first few hours of programming, Caprica has already addressed the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul. The casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientists facing, to his restless and intentional daughter, each actor and actor throws himself into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music so widely used in BSG also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mended duvets served it pretty well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound that gives the show its own, completely different from its predecessor. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely its own show that only draws from the Battlestar franchise as much as it needs. I'm looking forward to the whole series.
