This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment. It sometimes becomes quite hysterical fun, but if you haven't spent some time on the 'side' of the tracks, you'll miss the comedy when it goes out. <br /> <br /> Throwing characters is well signed up and completely credible in their roles. How Grace handles meeting her dead true girlfriend was well played. She is a true lady. And my favorite is Grace's white pimp suit, which she wears. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh aloud, who cheers for underdog or just wants to see something different.
