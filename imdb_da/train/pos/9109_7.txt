Basically, it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the competition, but regular directors from a historical fact start talking about something else, or they also show the period before or after this fact, everything happens during the days when the revolution works. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two people and shows as normal they were, not as ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from humans. Although it was made by the military army from the title, one can understand that they were only "capitals" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and lights throughout the film, excellent work for the director to be her first movie, she does not fall into the banal way. Well-shown feelings and passion for people and crowds. The character of Maia (main one) is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, who can show Maia's boundaries, this is not a hero.
