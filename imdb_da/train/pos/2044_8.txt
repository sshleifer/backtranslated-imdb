This is a good little shocker; not perfect by any kind of imagination, but tight, competent and disruptive. An excellent example of a simple idea evolved into a compelling 90 minute script. <br /> <br /> The setup requires no bells and whistles, no elongated exhibit or proper back story; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German businesswoman living in London, runs off while waiting for the last tube train. She awakens to find the place deserted, but quickly comes in to realize that she is far from alone. Someone or something is down there with her, and the intention is utterly vicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, she encounters several other signs in her quest to survive, including a lecherous colleague, a homeless couple, and a cage wastewater work, all of which add pace and substance to the plot. There is a little awkward shift somewhere in the middle of the movie, when the thriller mutates to the gore party, but nothing so clumsy to slow down the hectic pace. For those of you with weak dispositions, it is likely to be a needy trip; For those of you who enjoy a little well done carnival chaos, this should tap all the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie may be less successful than the movie's main body, but it is drawn with a good moment of unexpected social commentary that gives a satisfactory conclusion. Some may feel a bit cheated by a clear explanation of the exact nature and history of the threat Kate and her confused encounter, but for me that was not the case. A horror movie writer does not have to feel compelled to dot every one and cross every t, just as a writer of political thrillers could be expected to. There are enough tracks here to give you a very clear idea of ​​what caused this evil, making a detailed and crucial solution superfluous. The preservation of some sense of mystery is to be welcomed and remind us that in this movie the trip was always more important than the exact destination. My understanding is that the budget for this movie was at least minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror should be harder, for no time has the impression that the corners are being cut or the effects do not deliver. <br /> <br /> If it sounds like your kind of movie then it's for sure. Buy a ticket and climb aboard.
