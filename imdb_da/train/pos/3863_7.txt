This is an interesting series that takes real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes a part of their real story with a continuing cartoon character taking part in that story. Railroad Detective "Matt Clark" - plays a role in tracking famous criminals from the Old West in stories that are at least partially based on true accounts. In that sense, it is almost an anthology series, and as another pointed out, this odd structure constitutes a timeline conflicting with the real events, but it is a fun series of lots of actions to satisfy a wildly hungry 1950s audience - and It still holds just over 55 years later. Clark cuts a strong figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of the bad guys in history. And his girl sidekick Frankie is right dish. If you are a western fan, be sure to check it out if you have a chance.
