I have always believed that David and Bathsba were a movie originally intended for Tyrone Power by 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck gives a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> A lot of Biblical topics are covered by this movie, infidelity, redemption, sin, punishment, and generally what God expects of his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, just king prophesied in a biblical prophecy of kingdom, you certainly have many perogatives who are not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including a real vicious one in Jayne Meadows, who was David's predecessor daughter of Saul. But his eyes look Bathsheba in her garden one evening. Turns out she is so unhappy married to the uria hetit as david is for a few women. Uriah is one of David's captains. David sends to Bathsba, and he's the wife, she's coming a race because she's also watching him. <br /> <br /> What happens, an affair, a pregnancy, and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in a fight. But all seeing and knowing deity has captured all this and not just punishing David and Bathsba, but the whole of Israel is punished by drought, sickness and plague. The sexist law of the day invites Bathsheba to have a stoning death. David shows weakness in his earlier actions, but here he climbs up to the record and asks for the whole matter to be put on him. He even puts hands on the covenant sheet, which was an instant death as seen in the film. My interpretation of it is that God admires gut, even if you're wrong, and he makes up for David and forgives both of them. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon, and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they both conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is a fetching Bathsba caught in a loveless marriage with uria played by kieron moore The only thing that makes Moore awake is a good blow. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and pretty stupid horse behind. <br /> <br /> No one can lay down the law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan prophet is consistent with the John Brown character he played in two films, the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So when His own law called to death, why did God eat Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Perhaps the fact that he just wouldn't train a third guy was for the job. He had already replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I think the Christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the New Testament that emerges that one can sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitent. I leave it to the Biblical scholars to submit interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you can come up with a whole new theory.
