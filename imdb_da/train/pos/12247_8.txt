I really loved this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was great as Emma and Mark were very good as knightly. The only complaint I had was at Mr. Woodhouse. I can't believe a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life. She was, however, a smart girl at last. As always, I love the places where these Jane Austin movies were shot. the settings are so spectacular. it makes me visit England as much as Ireland and Scotland) I think the actors elected for this movie were also a good choice and all the other stories line up with Emma's most outstanding! I'm glad I must see this too.
