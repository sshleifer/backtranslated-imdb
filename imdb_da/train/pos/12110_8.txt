For those of you who believe anime is just about giant reptiles raping school girls, think again. There is a very different side to the Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a sweet-hearted tale of a young boy with the gift of making delicious bread. His universe is about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European bread. The view is as crazy as they come, and I'm sure non-Japanese viewers will miss many jokes. But it's still very nice to see because of the show's complete innocent vibe. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! It is not uncommon for people to appear to have just had orgasm after eating bread. The bread hallucinates and can provide the consumer with a wide variety of superpowers, from time driving to swimming as a fish. The weird aspect makes it one of the least predictable and fun shows I've seen for a while.
