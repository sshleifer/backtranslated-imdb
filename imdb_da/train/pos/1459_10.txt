Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a non-preachy documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This movie has zero storytelling and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China who live in a factory connection. They play with toys, jumping ropes and dancing. Nevertheless, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the images of their work are luminous and fascinating to see. The owner of the factory in China is incredibly open, so much that he hits home the effects of globalization while he "punishes" the workers. Astutely following the Mardi Gras pearls from China to Carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting, compelling recordings of both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cross-cultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers to each other through images. Here comes the movie full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never sermon, is not guilty and gives everyone's point of view. Finally, the viewers - our own conclusions about the film's complexity and globalization.
