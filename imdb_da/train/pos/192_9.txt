Prior to seeing Show People, my impression of silent comedy was largely slapstick and only slapstick. I couldn't imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on speech words or numerous talc. But this masterful movie showed me wrong. Davies was, in my opinion, probably the greatest comic actress to come together before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy primarily because Davies' way and facial expressions reminded me of the point that I wonder if Davies was not one of Ball's primary influences. It comes from a 21-year-old who had never before seen silent comedy, and I have to say that no matter how much of the periodic references you actually get (I don't seem to seem), you won't be bored with this movie. You will probably even laugh more than you would talk at most. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easy among my ten favorite comedies from time to time.
