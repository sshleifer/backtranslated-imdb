After several extremely good reviews for SUPERB, I was extremely pleased with the movie. The film was dark, moving, anger, the pain, blame and a very extremely convincing demon. I had originally expected to see many special effects, and as a lover's caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and accuracy of it. Brian, I am again blown away with your artistry with the story of the story and your care for the special effects. You want to go far, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> The best actress Eric Etebari was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez looks like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, the play, the storyline, the high-quality movie and the amazing effects were amazing. I just wished it was longer. I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
