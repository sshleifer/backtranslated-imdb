This story was never among my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if it was a little exaggerated, the bones of history are there, even though more emphasis is placed on the crime in the past. The students were all pretty much as I imagined them, even though it was a pity that they were not a more cosmopolitan pile - perhaps the attitude of the revised thirties was not allowed for it! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the movie; Perhaps it is because I haven't read the book for a long time, but it seemed to me quite obvious who the killer was of their appearance in some revealing shots quite early. Humor was much more prevalent in these early poirotes. Sometimes it works, but I found much of it rather heavily delivered in this episode (though I smiled at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line). All in all, however, a solid entry into the series, but not one of the best.
