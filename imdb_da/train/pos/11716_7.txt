Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a television host for late-night horror movies, and when the sign appeared unexpectedly popular, she found everything from beer advertising to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She reached the top of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result. <br /> <br /> The reason is flight weight. Television horror movie host Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her big aunt dies, she travels to New England hoping that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; She is disappointed to find that she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that the city is puritanical all over the description, and she provokes fair indignation wherever she goes. It also happens that her great uncle in secret is a vicious warlock and very appropriate to put hands on "the old book". Throw a few teenagers, a stud muffin and a hateful woman with fakes and wherever you go. No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it occasionally draws. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy and blends lowbrow humor with flashing sharp comedy, she dances through the movie as a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-sucking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft madness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. It's a huge amount of fun, and the movie's conclusion even manages to generate considerable excitement. Will Elvira be the best evil uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you're having fun finding out. <br /> <br /> DVD quality is okay and there is little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something stupid, it's safe to respond to the craving. And if you've never seen chirping twirling, you're in for a treat. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
