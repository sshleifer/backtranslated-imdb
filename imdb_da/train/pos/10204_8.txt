Although it's not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I've had Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read the comic book and saw it in the video store and decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> The animation was ok, I got the feel of the 80's anime from it, which is what it is for me. Why everyone else hates outside me. <br /> <br /> Character development was fine. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around. Of course, for those who do not like it, they were not aware. Lucifer tells you how it happens and she used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a lovely mentor / soldier for her. his dark bridal style was perfect for this kind of movie. I think everyone here who has bashed this must take a fresh look at it and reconsider. Because all people have bashed this can be said of everyones favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
