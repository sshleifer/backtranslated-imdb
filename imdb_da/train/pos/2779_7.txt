That "Bend It Like Beckham" can't mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer) but to English sports fans, it corresponds to "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan". Every young footballer dreams of bending a football about a player and into the net for a goal, like the great Indian, David Beckham, does like the young Indian girl Jess (Parminder Nagra) in the movie Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up football games, the kind prohibited by her traditional mother. But while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her game and invites her to try a journey, all girls football teams. After fulfilling the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows the mother wouldn't approve. The film is not about non-obedient parents, but rather a girl does what she wants to do, even if it goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown through the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The movie goes to something of a clich√© moment, as the big football game is the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it doesn't come out of a cheesy but pretty fun and light. The football action looks great so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of football will inspire some in the audience. Bend it like Beckham is not just about football, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please the parents at the same time, something that turns out to be quite difficult.
