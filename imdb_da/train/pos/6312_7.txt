Before George Clooney instructed Sam Rockwell in his direct debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they stared together in this movie. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer along with Steven Soderbergh, who shows that they really believed in this project. In the potential, this also seems like a nice and entertaining project that is in the same line with movie remakes like "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this movie is only halved successfully, or at least It is not as good as it could have been. <br /> <br /> The movie's characters are all played by some well-known actors, but it is a shame that the characters don't really get enough space to evolve. Although in their potential they could have turned into fun and fun characters, they are now only mildly entertaining characters, mostly by some of the more skewed sequences in the movie. The fact that they are being played does not change much about this, even though they prevent their signs of being completely drilled or perhaps even annoying or anything at all. Of course, it is because of the writing that the characters are not used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this film does. The film relies too much on its simple history and predictable way of telling. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is simply still a lot of fun to watch, perhaps because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless little hijacker's movie, where you simply shouldn't worry much about the story. In this respect, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works and works simply well. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you won't regret when you finish it, but it's also a movie you can really do without seeing it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
