This should be one of the best movies about serial killers I've ever seen, and it comes from a person who absolutely loved the silence of the lamb. HBO has hit the jackpot here. This movie is convincing from the first moment to the last. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many underlying themes, it's hard to tell exactly what it's about. It chronicles the decade-long search for Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives an excellently-booked performance as the inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the study, and Donald Sutherland gives an even more involved achievement as his cynical superior, and the only one in the Russian government is willing to help him. Both of their performances are subtle masterpieces --- Rea begins naively and unwillingly to compromise while Sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation. At the end, Rea becomes more world-famous and beaten by the system, while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic. In any other movie I would have said that Sutherland's performance stands out above the rest, but here it is even rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann, a serial killer. DuMann brilliantly creates a sign here that inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find --- he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we get the idea that he is just as crazy about what he does as we are. He becomes tortured, ashamed, but also malicious. <br /> <br /> If you can take that incredibly dark subject (and it's * very * disturbing) then watch this movie.
