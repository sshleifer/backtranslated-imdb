Personally, I discard the Jerry Springer Show, but I found "Ringmaster" to be the funniest movie I've seen this year. The endless satire of Jerry Springer "guests" starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing the whole movie. Despite a short scene where Jerry Springer makes a weak attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for pure entertainment value.
