Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just finished seeing it again. I couldn't help getting emotional in her last scene. She didn't get Oscar. Therefore, do not put too much faith in Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-D, deficient person. Jean Peters was great as the streetwise, hard girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; Why else would I have hated him so. Yes, it was heavily entrusted to patriotism; But without that, you don't have much of a movie. See their faces! The three best stars didn't really need much script. I would like to see them make this movie without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief," you may know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No. 66. That was when I knew Hollywood couldn't trust. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I don't give much of the story because I hate it when I know what's going on before I see it for myself. If you have seen it, it is not necessary to clarify it. Just maybe someone reading these comments hasn't seen "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; just don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City.
