This is one of three 80s movies that I can think of that were unfortunately overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a movie terribly overlooked by Salva's legal / sexual problems. Another would be Cameron's Closet, which hits me as something undervalued - not big but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is worth your time, and I think it's one of the very quiet movies that just sticks to your brain for much longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after I have seen it, and I still give it a break, while something that I may have seen 6 months ago has entered the ether.
