This movie is amazing. A new Blade Runner - future noir on it is most gritty. The vision of Paris is fantastic, both recognizable and visionary, with sweeping views, grungy sets and futuristic virtual reality. The storyline is pretty simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the movie. It is a visual treatment. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and rendered in black and white (no grays!) with only a short color, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many "arty" camera shots - close-ups and odd views - but it just adds to the temperament of the movie. All in all, you get the impression of a graphic novel in recording form. <br /> <br /> I was initially under the impression that the movie had become rotoscoped, so was the animation level and high definition in the character's facial expressions. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly" - suffering from (or actually improving) inconsistent character definition (just see how some of the hair changes shape!) - the Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. When the character is in close-up, additional details and texture can be added, but when left in the middle of shot or farther, but not to the detriment of character definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only bottom of the movie is that in a comment we are told that this is a one-time project. Such shame as I would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir story and especially in this exciting graphic style. Oh, and the English dub is also great. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie and highly recommended.
