A cute little movie that would not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to be cut off by the same cloth as half a dozen other British comedies over the past two years ... underdog faces adversity, finds the force to challenge and learn about themselves in the process. <br /> <br /> Widow and thus broke, Grace is a master gardener, and is attracted to helping his friend / employee Matthew grow his pot plant. He's done it wrong so Grace helps him out. They realize she is the perfect person to harvest pot that they can both benefit from. He enjoys smoking, she needs to raise funds to pay off her mortgage. <br /> <br /> The highlight is Grace, who travels to London to handle some of her items, dressed in what looks like the white suit John Travolta had in "Saturday Night Fever" and therefore stuck out like a tender thumb . <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always reliable and you can't tell it about many people .. yes I can't do that anyway. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, whom I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply moving or insightful, but immensely entertaining, and in a lively 90 minutes it feels like a trip with friends. 8.10.
