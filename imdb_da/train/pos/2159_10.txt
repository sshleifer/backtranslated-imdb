First, there is no way that remake can be so good because Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a big role in this movie as explained in the opening story. It adds both humor and warmth to this movie. There are many different supporting characters / personalities. Each participates in making this movie wonderful. This movie is filled with comedy that is not vulgar in anyway as most of today's "widespread comedies". But it can still make you laugh aloud. The reality is, in fact, you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with ... etc. This movie really emphasizes it and shows that the natural good in humans can overcome petty differences. Not to mention, it provides a great deal of plot and a lot of humor. This is a story of dance that actually has a story and a good one. There are a few back stories that are not out of place but actually support the main story. Really a well-written movie. The dance is also great. I happen to be a fan of any movie with any kind of dance for that aspect. But this film goes beyond everyone else with dance, in the fact that it is a story first and just happens to be written about dance in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
