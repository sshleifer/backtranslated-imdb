Well, I wasn't sure how the movie was going to be as I only saw a small clip, but I thought it would be good and I was right, I saw it twice in the day, I got it and that is my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played part of Beth really well. She is such a gigantic actress, and the author must have gone into a lot of research to find out if bulimia, even if it ends when in hospital, has 2 Horus observations after meals, because iv has been told that 1 house is ok and that hospitals do not help bulimik who iv have been told, which is probably why i am still at home even though my sister and mother would like to get me hospitalized when i have bulimia but that is a free movie, I recommend it to anyone with or without an eating disorder or to people who know one with eating disorders, as it can let them into the life of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over everyone a grate movie and Recommend it to anyone and any type of person
