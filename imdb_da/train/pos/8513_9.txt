I have always had the philosophy that each and every person has different tastes, I found this movie to be great, and I think any college student out there can agree with me. Despite this, not a "movie with a plot" is about real guys and some of the "problems" they face. I found the movie fun (especially the parts they played the practical jokes on each other). In short, if you are in the same "wavelength" as these people, you will find this movie amazing. I don't think this will win any Golden Globes or Oscars, or that the people in this movie will be future Hollywood stars, but it is a kind of "cult classic" among young people who could relate to their experience. For me, the guy who stands out most is Hans: the Scandinavian guy who, according to him, "is not a looking", but gets all (or some) of the chickens. The "little ones" also play a major role in the movie, especially when they are full. If I continue, I can give a spoiler, and I won't do it, just go get the movie and you won't regret it. I give it an 8/10
