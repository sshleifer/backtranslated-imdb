Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I highly recommend this movie. Her performance was, in my opinion, Academy Award material! The only real sad fact here is that Universal hasn't seen that this movie was ever available in any video format, whether it was tape or DVD. They ignore a very good movie. But Universal has little regard for its library on DVD, which is sad. If you get the chance to see this somewhere (not sure why it rarely even runs on cable), watch it! I don't want to go into history because I think most people would rather have an opinion about the movie and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> and 10!
