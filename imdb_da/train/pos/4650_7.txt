As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I have had the nice Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flying scenes in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert Rb 75 (Maverick) missile painted black with the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. Real jammer pods certainly do not look, at least not the ones I have seen. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very funny ending (last minute). Anyone interested in watching different Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, on film, should see this. <br /> <br />
