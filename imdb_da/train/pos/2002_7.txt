To some extent, I really liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRES. I found that movie to be rather misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I am accustomed to women in danger being a staple of the genre. But they just hit Sheryl Lee around too much. In this movie Natasha Wagner is a more fully realized character and the most important evil guy is crazy! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very World War II and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, no good actress, but he does well. At least he doesn't start singing. Catch it on cable if you can. It's on Encore Action this month.
