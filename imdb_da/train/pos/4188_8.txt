Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, primarily because he had a very inconsistent policy in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the war graves, "Merrill's Marauders" painted war as needed hell and "Pickup on South Street" is about the dangers by communist spies. All his films make it very entertaining to watch, and although he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker, Fuller was as good as any of the great studio entrepreneurs. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film-making style is remarkable ahead of its time. It is also a very fast pace, tight and occasionally brutal movie noir. The play across the board is fantastic. Richard Widmark makes a great anti hero, and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl working for her communist spy girlfriend. Show stealer is Thlema Ritter however in a very nice performance as a police chair. The Fuller Angles are large, making the working sequences more exciting and brutal (it is very violent for its time). The camera is constantly moving around, as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great action-paced noir thriller. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but it is a very close second. (8/10)
