The silent film, Pride of the Clan with Mary Pickford, was supposed to be in a fictitious island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the exterior shots were filmed in Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky seaside geographical areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My original interest in the movie was due to two factors: 1) Marblehead movie placement in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a stand-in for Mary Pickford while recording multiple scenes, including the "cut scene". Both women were small (5 ') and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand-in with her back to the camera for the rock play as part of the Chiefton movie. I just wanted to relate this story to future movie historians and buffs. The movie itself (my DVD copy is somewhat bad) is very well done with lots of action and expressive plays, including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong women's characterization. I enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it, even though I am unsure whether one exists as I have seen on various movie sites that residual copies are dark due to deterioration. A very nice movie of the quiet genre with lots of action!
