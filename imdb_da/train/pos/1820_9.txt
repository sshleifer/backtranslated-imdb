I remember this movie from when I was a young child, I loved it, and I do it now. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was happy because I had found it so hard to find it earlier, and it had only been rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is filled with fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker for me, but I think if I hadn't seen the movie when I was little, then I wouldn't find it as brilliant and fascinating as I did, though I still think I still want to liked it because I am really into animated movies.
