One word can describe this movie, and it's weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Yes it was, the film is about a young boy who raises the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you're a fan of animation / science-fiction, you might want to check this out.
