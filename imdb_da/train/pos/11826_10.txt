I never attended the midnight show of a movie before "Dick Tracy" came out. <br /> <br /> I still have the "t-shirt ticket" I had to carry to be admitted to show around here somewhere and, Like that kind of shirt, "Dick Tracy" has since been stuck. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie, the sharp images, bright primary colors, and strong characters have no doubt been etched in your brain. It is wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> As director / star / co-author / producer, at Beatty what works in a movie and shows it here, takes a well-known American icon and recreates him for a whole New era. Tracy still has a kind of timeless quality that every good movie does. I've wasted how many times I've seen "Tracy" and I still catch something new every time I do. <br /> <br /> The others are top notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can make comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is relevant to the real thing environment, she can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> However, such themes are still concerned as the family's necessity, faith in oneself, good at evil, even Machiavellian themes are explored. Odd for a comic film, but hey, it works. All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic to himself. Compared to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It's a good, strong movie that doesn't depend on blood, violence, misery or nudity to make its point. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to learn here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
