Although I have not seen this mini-series for over twenty years, I can still remember how the balance between character, plot and tale of amazing adventures succeeded. The use of special effects was prevented from making a more poetic rather than literal story about the story. The two versions I've seen were dubbed (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their own language, not just Italian, so there's a synchronization problem. It does not destroy the story of history. Among the cast Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable to the North Americans. Recommended to all supporters of Odysseus' ever back.
