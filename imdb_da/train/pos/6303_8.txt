After hearing quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer I had to watch this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present, it had to be good. And it delivered. Overall, the movie is not crack-up-up fun, but there is a scene that really stands out and is in my eyes a classic. SPOILER At the end, when they break through the wall to get to safety and we see Rockwell and Washington staring at Jeter, it's just amazing. This is as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski, where The Dude uses a chair to barricade his door, but forgets that the door is facing out! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you won't be disappointed.
