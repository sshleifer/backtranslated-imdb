For me, a matter of life and death is just that - simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end it pours class. It is stimulating, thought-provoking, a mirror for the post-war world and the relationship between people. <br /> <br /> Kinematics is simply amazing, and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolor to accent the different worlds seems smooth. The character and plot development is almost perfect, and attention to detail promotes a thoroughly credible imagination. No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I've seen it a lot - it never fails me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It's as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I was allowed only one movie to watch again. A question of life and death would be that movie.
