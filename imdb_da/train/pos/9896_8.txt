I've been seeing this flick for the last couple of months. I was actually surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The reason is about a group of high school students who bully a boy named Marty. They are constantly bothering him until one of them makes a terrible mistake, leaving Marty terribly burnt. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the group of reckless teens is invited back to their own high school, now abandoned to a party. Although not one of the ruthless teenagers has organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later through the movie, teens begin to die in the most cruel ways. I can definitely tell you that they are gory too. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you find that it was all a dream and none of it happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not happen, the burners and pranks appeared apparently. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, but that's fine. I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). Bullies get what comes to them in the end, and you end up feeling satisfied with the victim getting their sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend anyone download this if you're looking for 80's slashers. <Br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheesy slasher!
