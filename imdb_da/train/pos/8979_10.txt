I loved this movie, first the smooth graphics seemed strange with the grainy recording, but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of recordings and I really admire the work of cutting it down. If you are easily shocking with drugs or violence, it may not be the movie for you, but there are some good figures here, (and some real tossers). Technically, I also liked it, they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe it was just that the shots looked so dark, but I was not annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video for movie uploads. (Open water drove me nuts, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now, and I see no excuse not to protect for one if you are going to the movie screen). Sorry, it's my own little rant. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever been involved in the music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most of it is hilarious, I can be accused of laughing at someone else's accident, but it's a classic piece.
