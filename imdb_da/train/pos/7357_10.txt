OK where do I start? ... This movie changed my life! The reason was seamless. James Cahill has made himself out. Originally after a first impression, I was disappointed that I hadn't seen it on the silver screen. But this was before exploring the many features of the DVD !!!! Oh, my god Jakes Cahill's comment on the movie was almost as flawless as his acting. He told about the industry secrets used in the movie, which you only get with experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the other actors. The scene where the security guard speaks to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I am determined with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without successor. I'm still blown away with every display of the martial arts skills involved, only matched with the sign indicating the location of the school library ... and possibly the guy playing a retard! All in all, a timeless classic and the best movie coming out of Europe this year! where my oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
