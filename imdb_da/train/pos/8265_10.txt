The name of this movie alone made me want to see what it was all about so I taped this movie in the early hours of AM. If you ever see what miners were going through in the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles on the men. This film will clearly show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after WW I, and how the Germans came to the help of French miners much to the disbelief of French citizens. The actors were all excellent, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy working in the mine. There is an old old retired miner who needs to walk down the mine at the ladder when the elevator breaks down. If you're a real movie bird, it's a movie you don't want to miss.
