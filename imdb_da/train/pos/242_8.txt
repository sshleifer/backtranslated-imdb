I thought this movie was very well made, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and trustworthy. How true that is, what really happened, I have no idea, but it portrayed why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps in authority they have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that over 30,000 signed a request to Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this movie than at first thought? In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical movie. All in all, I strongly recommend this movie, and I'm a little confused why it didn't do better in the movie theaters.
