A sweet and quite charming movie, should we dance? made me laugh and cry. At first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing - an excited salary, apparently devoted to his family, but too easily imprisoned by a face in a window. The obsession with his obsession is distant and cold. But at the end of the movie I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all dance instructors and dance students. This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that I would like to see again.
