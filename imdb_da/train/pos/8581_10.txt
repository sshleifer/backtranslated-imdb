This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute are not intelligent enough to understand all the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and "fictional" actions can produce a winning combination. Also as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see everything as good as Donald Sutherland sings a song like "They'll find your anus on a mountain on Mars."
