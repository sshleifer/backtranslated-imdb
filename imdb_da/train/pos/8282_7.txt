** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Most of the movie that doesn't work is Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind it. The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo form is interesting and can be duly threatening when properly recorded - when the floating killer sees Wendigo in a snap in his rearview mirror, for example - and the wooden shape was actually very good. But as a monster character, it never really comes to life. We don't get much of an explanation for its behavior, and what we see from it doesn't slip with the story told in the movie itself, or any Wendigo lore I've ever read. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why the monster fails is that it's not enough to do in the movie. When you cook this movie down to the bones, you have an exciting thriller with a little supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster. The camera is good, though it is a little cheap; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting and time of day to convey mood and mood quite well. Otis character comes across as really dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the movie. It might have been more effective to explain his behavior when he was obsessed with Wendigo's hungry spirit, which would also be a more precise representation of the real legend. <br /> <br /> I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason why Wendigo doesn't do much is that when the monster dress was built, it wrapped it so heavily and uncomfortably (to imitate the attitude of The thing that stood on clover hooves, the practitioner had to walk on his toes), that it was almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise perform it. Thus, the many flashes of the creature stand still, and the obvious sped-up recordings of it run. I emphasize that these reports are unconfirmed.
