I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. The director? I don't do too many things about him ... and I don 't be sure. In a few words, I have to say about this movie, which is weird, strange, even dark, but it's good. I saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then. I want to see it again and again. I know I won't get sick of seeing it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is good. The movie should have lasted longer. I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for part 2 for this movie. Wrong it has happened. Jason Patric: You're the man! very good movie. end. :-)
