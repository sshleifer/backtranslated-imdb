A real dark noir movie and a very graphic movie, a wonderful story by a man pursuing redemption who might just have left it too late. Visually, there are some really beautiful scenes that are amazingly amazing what can be done with a minimal budget. Full marks to Gareth Maxwell Roberts and team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although hopefully more UK players would be great. Lisa Ray looked lovely not seen her before and hopes to see her again in the future. Subject all interesting sex, drugs and violence. Came with it. I would definitely say renting this one and checking it out if you are in the mood for a semi moody noir.
