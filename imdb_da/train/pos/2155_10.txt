Auditor Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) feels sorry for his routine life, confined to hard work and staying home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his teenage daughter. One night while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) in a dance school's balcony, and a few days later he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every Wednesday night. However, he is ashamed to tell his family his family. Meanwhile, Masako feels the changes in her happy husband's behavior and hires a private eye to see if Shohei has an affair. <br /> <br /> I just finished seeing "Shall We Dansu?" and I really loved it. What a lovely and lovely movie! The story is incredibly good with drama, comedy and romance. The molding is excellent and I was particularly impressed by the cold beauty and graciousness of the king to director Masayuki Suo and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6, I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time and I found it a great entertainment. But now I can say that this is another unnecessary remake and I recommend this original movie instead. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
