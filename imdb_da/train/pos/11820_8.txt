Hi, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-year-old comics-customized films rated 5.9, would you call me crazy? It's just to catch your attention. Every day I meet people who complain that there are no good movies that seem to know only the recent blockbusters. It is never a bad thing to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who is not easily outdated in terms of technology. The negative reviews complained mainly about DT's "messed up" story. But it seems to me that history is quite clear, and I had no problem following it. I didn't see the comics, but I'm not a big American cartoon fan, but I appreciate the best filmmaking and performances. Perhaps most people's expectations were too high about the story, it would tell. But if you see a movie encountering Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect. I had some scratches on my head and can't help wondering, did we really see the same movie? The title role, though not as competent as it sounds, was still able to pull him up and charm the audience. Madonna was more expressive than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was fun and wonderful to himself. Apparently, he is bold enough to go sarcastic on his formerly successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro by beating our abdominal pain to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups. <br /> <br /> For me it is not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me.
