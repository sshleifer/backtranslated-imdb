This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that for many people, they do not want to see movies that are not down with missing arms and legs, free violence, and enough explanations to fill out the New York phone book. This movie is neither of them. It's clich√©, it's formal, but it's fun too. It doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't require you to accept the movie as a reality. It simply does what a good movie should do that is willing to suspend infidelity for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The molding is good but not excellent. As another commenter pointed out the John Williams sound score was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that much of the movie was shot in Huntsville in the real space camp made it even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the movie was delayed for some months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a major role in the original theatrical opening, but the movie has finally contributed to focus many young people's dreams back into space and the possibilities that lie in it. Then sit back with your children and prepare to enjoy.
