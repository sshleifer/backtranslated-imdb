It's a pity that this movie is so hard to get in the US. I found it through a rare video dealer and it was definitely worth it. It is undoubtedly the best film made in the precoded era and the finest movie from the 1930s. First-class instructor Frank Borzage made great films about depression, and with MAN'S CASTLE he created an adventure in the midst of the era. Honor Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them and they help make this movie a wonderful romance. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy's Bill is gruff and closed. The dynamics of the character creates one of the most difficult, but eventually rewarding relationships on film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most soft-focus pre-code movie I've ever seen. Borzage uses the lazy and dreamy technique to turn the village village where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The depression of the depression is never ignored, in fact they are integrated into the film. But when Borzage handles the film as a soft focus adventure, the love between the characters creates the situation less hard. It makes the film warm and loving. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the fighting achievement of the precoded era. If only more people could see it.
