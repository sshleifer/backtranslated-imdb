In the process of trying to establish the public's empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), filmmakers are decaying North and Jayhawkers. Missouri never pulled from the Union, and the Union Army was not an invading force. The South Isles fought for state rights: the right to own slaves, choose skewed legislators and judges, and use a political spoiler system. There is nothing noble about it. The Missourians could easily have traveled east and joined the Confederate army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that history has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, it is not because he saw errors in his way, he certainly does not indulge in the cause of the abolition.
