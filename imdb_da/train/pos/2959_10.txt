It was a Saturday night, and a movie called BASEketball was on TV. I had always wanted to see it, but never came to it when it was in the cinema. Boy was I wrong. Words cannot describe how much fun this movie is, with the main roles of South Parks creators sharing a natural screen chemistry when they are fun. I lost the play the next day and exactly one week after seeing it for the first time, I've seen it 7 times !!. I'm obsessed with that, and I know everyone who appreciates trey and matt's work will appreciate this movie. One must see, this is my # 1 comedy all the time
