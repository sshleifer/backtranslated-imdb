Those who love the book Jane Eyre as I do (it's my all-time favorite and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a bit too nice to be Mr. Rochester, but apart from that, he does a wonderful job depicting Thornfield's overwhelming master. Zelah Clarke may have been a little too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I see this movie, I am not thinking about the age of the characters. The dialogue from the film is taken almost properly from the book, which was very smart. Of course, this movie may seem a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that contains part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I want the people who made this movie to have been involved in the newer Zeferelli version, as it would have helped the mess in a movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized last time I saw this video that Judy Cornwell is playing "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile that I do not recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping Up Appearances and also played Ms. Musgrove in 1995's Persuasion (another wonderful adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Got the DVD this week and it's wonderful to see the original unedited version. There is much more in the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lowood.) And in the end they have restored many things (I always wondered why St. John had a piece of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the American VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in it ... she was completely carved by VHS. As far as I could tell, they hadn't edited any of Timothy Dalton's parts, so there's nothing new there, but it's great to see the entire miniseries in their entirety after all these years enjoying VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... with maybe some interviews with the stars ... or an exhibition)
