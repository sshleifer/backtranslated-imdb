"California" is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The movie has a great cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A river runs through it and The Legends of the Fall) like Early Greyce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Murder : Life on the street and escape from LA) like Carrie Loughlin, Brian's boyfriend and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear, and what does Gilbert Grape eat) as Adele Corners, Early's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a liberal writer ready to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend decide to move Carrie to California, so Brian puts a college ad for some who want to go to California to share expenses on the trip. Early Grayce is an ex-con and sociopath on parole who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town, is in debt, owes his landlord money. Her parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job. Going to college and seeing the ad, he later tells Adele, his girlfriend about going to California. Earl and Adele meet with Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town. Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord. For a while Brian and Carrie thought about Early and Adele differently, but taught them to become friends, Carrie and Adele became really good friends. Their journey is a great learner. Although Brain and Carrie do not know early, a killer is later in the movie. The question Brian asks in this movie about the difference between murderers and us is a very good question. Owner Grayce is a sociopat who does not see the error of his ways down the hill later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up. I love the songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look Up To The Sky" by the Indians.
