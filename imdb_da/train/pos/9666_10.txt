Bette Medler is again divine! Raunchily humorous. Am in love with burlesque. Can bring you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or just with old songs with more power and strokes than ever. All in all, new ballads, stream-singing the good old / perennials like "The Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Wind under my wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been libe - as this is the second best, it is highly recommended to anyone with a blend of adult burnt enchantment and appreciation and a child's evil desire to push all boundaries!
