This movie could have been a silent movie; It certainly has the feeling of one. I was extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this movie. Ecstasy is a "symphony of love" and transcends all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems perfectly suited to this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr lights up on the screen, in this movie, which in a way is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic. Technical qualities may have been a little raw; but it does not detract from the magic magic this film exudes. Many lovers of the early cinema will absolutely love this movie.
