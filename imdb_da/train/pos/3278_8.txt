This is a wonderfully written and well-behaved psychological drama. It's not really a horror flick, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this movie was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil Psychobab or New Age Revisionism. Instead of speeding up an agenda, the filmmakers just said the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dream collections are reminiscent of Wyeth's paintings and are incredibly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good movie on a small budget without major studies, star performers, big-name directors (this was much better than many of Hitchcock's movies), special effects or "clever" plot twists.
