Exciting. Exciting. Dramatically. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the top of the iceberg compared to the great story that is lost to being told. <br /> <br /> From the play down to the rare visual effects, LOST is the major show on television for science-fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and masses and many mysteries. <br /> <br /> Each cast member is so well-chosen and so good in their roles that you either love them or hate them or even want them dead. <br /> <br /> The visual effects when used (which is rare) are actually quite well-finished considering the usual production of shows. Whether it's history, nothing can be compared to the great complexity that this show has made viewers to endure. Beginning ends, continuity is almost perfect, characters evolve, and the ever-evolving story slowly gives the answers to its questions as many desires. In general, almost no errors are lost. It makes for dramatic / sci-fi TV what Arrested Development did for comedy: it has set the bar. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and love every moment of the trip, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> See this show.
