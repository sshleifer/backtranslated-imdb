This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for years, especially for a war-based (short) movie. Basically, it is a story based in two worlds, one of course real, the other fictional, but the filmmakers say at first that it is only random if it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was to collide in a plane he spoke to June (Apes' Kim Hunter Planet) before he bailed out and said he loved her. He had to die by jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and loves June in the flesh. This other place, like a sky, is unhappy because he survived and was supposed to come to their world to send French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but of course he is in love. Peter suggests him to appeal to keep his life to the right of the other world, he gets it. Clearly, love prevails when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, June even offers to take a seat! Also with Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as an angel, a short (so unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as an English pilot and Abraham Sofaer as judge / surgeon. David Niven was number 36 on the 50 largest British actors, the movie was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 47 at The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 46 on the 50 largest British films and it was number 59 on the 100 largest films. Excellent!
