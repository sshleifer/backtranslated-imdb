I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just looked at it recently, and it's still fun. I don't know if you should understand hip hop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 90s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal disputes in the groups and members when their separate ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). Also there were wanna b's, available rappers who start making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from the C&C Music Factory, etc.). This movie makes it fun of all that in a way that seems like an actual documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The group's members are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Nerds Revenge and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an upcoming rap group whose policy makes them controversial. What's good about this movie is that it is so sour in its depiction of the hip hop industry in the 80s, and the way it pokes fun. But if you rap at the 80s / 90s, you know how much of these things are true. Your own hand without hip hop knowledge, it's still a fun funny movie, and for all those who ask, Spinal Tap comes first, but Spinal Tap is also not the first ghost film, which, in my opinion, is just as fun and in some ways better than Spinal Tap.As Spinal Tap is for heavy metal, fear of a black planet is rapping, and the songs are also of the hook.The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos by NWH as a group and as solo artists. Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
