I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip hop movies Ive seen as Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc. ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among the others. When I ask other people what is their fave, it seems that the BEAT STREET jumps out the most. But still the lowest is ranked by all. 4.3 is only a stroke "under the belt" (if that is said, 5 points is the belt). I love music performances, breakdancing makes me spin, RAMO makes me throw a piece ... c'mon, it's a classic !!!
