I can't believe we didn't have the 70's show anymore. I have all 8 seasons of the 70's show !! I absolutely love it !! I lie in bed every night and see more episodes before going to bed. At the end of a long busy day, it's great to kick back and have a good laugh before going to bed. I was so sorry they took the show out ... at least we still have re-runs !! I hope and pray they will come back with at least one reunion ... As maybe when Donna finished college and we finally see her and Eric gets married !!!! Wouldn't be great !!! It would be even better if they would continue for several years !!
