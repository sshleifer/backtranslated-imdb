This film is, in my opinion, despite its flaws (which I maintain are * few *), a whole masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art. What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create a completely beautiful movie and has shown his immense talent and versatility as an animated film director. He does not receive 1 / 100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving animation art for an adult audience. If it wasn't for Mr. Bakshi, I don't think animation would have survived the Disney attack. What's more with the Lord of the Rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated movie, but he has created a whole new art form - unfortunately one that never completely made it off the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the movie (the use of live action images used as background images and often animated by various techniques from what seems to be small quantities of staining for full blown animation). But I feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form that is beyond the norm. No, it's not Disney animation. No, it's not live action. No, it is not "cheating" - what it is, is a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic story as "The Lord of the Rings". Bakshi's groundbreaking use of this technique brings the subtlety of the Middle Ages to life, is a very dark and mysterious way, especially the darker of Tolkien's creatures, especially Nazgul, is realized in a way that traditional animation or live action has not been able to accomplish. <br /> <br /> Peter S. Beagle's manuscript (based very little on what I understand at an early draft by Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien's works. If possible, he uses dialogue directly out of the novel, and it feels at home in the world that Bakshi has created. There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 in a single 2-hour 15-minute movie, but there are very few changes in history. There are a few holes that it would have been nice to have filled: Narsil's reforging, Galadriel's gifts, Huorn's in Hornburg's battle, but again with the time constraints he had (already the longest animated feature in history), these are certainly understandable (though it makes one wonder how they might have been explained in a sequel). There is also the lovely (one of my favorites) scores of Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score clearly based on his LotR work)). It's bombastic and bold and dare I say perfect. It stands on its own as an orchestral stripe, but when combined with the film's images, it enters a whole new world with symphonic perfection. So far from the typical Hollywoodland ticket, it gets many people away. <br /> <br /> The voters are wonderful. Of particular note is John Hurt as Aragorn, who just oozes the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character design is also wonderfully unique, but not often for everyone's taste. But remember that it is the duty of the director to adapt to show you what he / she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so the Aragorn is realized with a distinctive native feel, and Boromir appears in the Viking-inspired rug. It may not be what you imagined, but I can only thank Mr Bakshi for showing us what he saw. "It may also be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in the development of distinctive movie for the movie. <br /> <br /> A longer word - the flight to the Ford sequence is, in my opinion, one of the most subtly beautiful scenes ever to be captured on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his mastery is clearly demonstrated by the incredible excitement that is capable of building. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's incredible work melts in that order into a brilliant top that is not yet identical. <br /> <br /> The latest DVD release (2001) by Warner Brothers lacks much, while we can offer our everlasting thanks that the movie is finally available in widescreen format, the package is vastly lacking in extras, how brilliant it would have been to have a director's comment , known e see the 20 minute extra footage that was removed for the theatrical release. Another nice addition could have been the live action footage that was later animated. Also present in the DVD release is the completely horrible voiceover at the end of the movie, which is a departure from the simple voiceover that occurred in the movie's final frame. This version is plastered and poorly reproduced just above the musical highlight of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy of all is that the successor was never made. We will never see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, Doom's crackers, Eowyn's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him. We will never be adorned with Bakshi's image of Denethor or Palatir or the dead roads. It's a shame for all the shame that we finally have to accept Peter Jackson's glitz and glitter Hollywood, action movie version of these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but it is even believed that it is better than having any movie version at all. <br /> <br /> David
