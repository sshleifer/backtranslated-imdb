This funny Bugs Bunny cartoon sees the return of the still-named Marvin the Martian and his sidekick K-9 the green dog. This time, instead of trying to destroy the earth, Marvin is on a mission to land, capture a land creature and take it back to March. Of course, the creature he chooses is Bugs Bunny. Initially, Bugs thinks that Marvin and K-9 are trick or treatment, but realize it can't be right when Marvin drastically magnifies Bug's rabbit hole with a jet gun. Bugs are trying to get rid of the situation in a few ways, including persuading Marvin that K-9 is planning a mutiny. Eventually, he is caught using an Acme sock jacket that emits bazooka. Amazingly, for an Acme product it seems as advertised, and Bug is forced to use his wits to get K-9 to release him, the tables are turning soon and the two dissatisfied Martians get trussed up and Bugs are trying to fly their plate back to earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, though the end is a little weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed a little here, and he becomes visibly emotional when angry, but it didn't make me like he or he did anything less.
