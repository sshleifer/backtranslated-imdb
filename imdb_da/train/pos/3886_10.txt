Eddie Izzard is a genius with his non-stop humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of the discovery (like Heimlich Maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard catches the heart of what we believe. I don't know when I laughed so hard at everyone's off-beat mind.
