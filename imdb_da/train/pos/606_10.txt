I have seen many Saura movies and have always found great how to collect music, dance, drama and great cinema in his films. Ib√©ria shows an even better Saura that deals with multimedia concepts and a more modern concept of dance and music. Another thing that called my attention is that in this movie dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: the camera shows different aspects of music interpretation and not only explores technical problems, but also emotional experiences of playing. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is yet another ingredient in making this film perhaps the most aesthetically exciting among its other works. Therefore, I strongly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, good art.
