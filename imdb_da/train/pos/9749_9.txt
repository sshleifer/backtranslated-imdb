I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I was certainly not least interested in opera at that time, but he changed my views. I've had this movie a lot and have really enjoyed the opera since then. I even bought several of his CDs. Who cares about what his acting abilities were, he just played himself, who was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sorry that so many criticize him so hard. It was so straightforward, did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed !!!
