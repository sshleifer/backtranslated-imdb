I collect from reading the previous comments that this movie went directly to cable. Well, I paid to see it in a theater, and I'm happy about it because it was visually a striking movie. Most of the settings seem to be made in the early 60s (with the exception of the shrink office, which was dated in another way), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences, the whole movie has a washed out early 60 ' ers atmosphere. And the use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For a first-time instructor whose background I believe is written, he has a good eye. Within the first ten minutes, I felt the plot lack of plausibility, so I just willingly suspended my disbelief and joined the trip. In terms of acting and portrayal of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationship, the movie was spot-on. William H. Macy, a pleasure to see, seems to fill the void of the late Tony Perkins if this and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was completely moving for me. It was a three-dimensional depiction of a character that is often seen by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable depictions. The performance of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me indirectly about Vincent Gallos BUFFALO '66, even though it was a bit dimmed! I would definitely pay money to watch another movie from this director. He has the self-discipline of a 50-year-old b-crime director (something P.T.Anderson will never have!), But he has a visual style and a way of acting actors.
