"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical story, heroic history and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a fantastic job of publishing a motivational, closely-related hero Steve Biko, but he is delivering a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his greatest "influencer", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But the ultimate success in his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to convey the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot to its audience. It is because of amazing movies like this that the public can be educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who tried to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this, "Cry Freedom" is a great movie that should be seen by everyone.
