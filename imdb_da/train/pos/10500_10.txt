Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with this very replay value are few and far between. Plus, this game has so much variation. There are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not detract from the game at all. Once you have turned it on, you will delete your game and start again. And it is just as much fun the second time, or the third or two hundred times. One must own for any Nintendo 64 owner and it is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64.
