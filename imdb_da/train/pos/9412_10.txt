When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I would also be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a friend together to see it another time. I don't think she was as impressed as I was! This movie was comical yet serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were quite new. Lessons from this film could be applied to problems related to GM experimentation today.
