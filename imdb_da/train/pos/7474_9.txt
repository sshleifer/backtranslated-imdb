This is one of the movies that is difficult to review without forfeiting the plot. Suffice it to say that there are weird things and unexpected phrases going beyond the original superficial "Tom Cruise screws around with more women" plots. <br /> <br /> The quality shock raises this movie over the norm, and all the casting is suitable for their parts: Cruises like the annoyingly slick playboy that has it all - and then loses it all, Diaz as the attractive but little distorted trembling lover, Cruz as the exotic new girl on stage and Russell as the paternal psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder mystery, excitement and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip. <br /> <br /> I should add that photography is also uniformly excellent and the deployment of various visual metaphors is beautiful when you are aware of what is going on. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy well-behaved movies with twists and turns, and are ready to accept a slightly amazing Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must-see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
