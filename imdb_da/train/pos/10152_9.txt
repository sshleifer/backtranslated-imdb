I was looking forward to seeing this since I first saw it in the list in his work. Finally, it found it yesterday 2/13/02 on the Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments that it was a "cute fun story of 2 people crossing paths" was dead. Authors may not get a bonus, everybody else SRO to make the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie MUST SEE IT. <br /> <br /> Natasha's screen presence is so hot and her smile so electric, not to say anything about her beauty, that all she is yesterday on my favorite list. Her TV and print interviews, which I have seen, are equally refreshing and worth looking for. God Bless her, her family, and future endeavors. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't seem to be available in DVD or video yet, but I'd be the first to buy it and I also think others would.
