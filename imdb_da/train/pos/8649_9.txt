I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to see it last night. I like Juliette Lewis, though I don't care about Brad Pitt. After this show I have to admit that he is a perfectly fine actor - his character was completely credible, and I didn't even think of Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for David Duchovny. I'm a fan of X-Files, and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as I thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny, but found his character a little two-dimensional here, except where he makes voice-overs. That part was strong, seemed in character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I continued to think "Agent Mulder", which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why haven't I noticed her before? (I will look up to see what other roles she has done and see them so little). I'm a little worried about the stereotypes Lewis, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a firm favorite). Interesting to see a contrast of characters - in NBK, she is a willing accomplice while giving the violence and trying not to recognize Early's dark side until it is pressed in her face. I enjoyed this movie almost unreservedly. Except for Duchovyne's character, which doesn't seem to be fully formed (and perhaps "leached out" some of Pitt's), it was perfect. I was also happy with the end - happy that the innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you like this movie and vice versa.
