Creepy and rather entertaining sleeping on two very different brothers, who are not only so-called "fire starters" (think Stephen King's snugest on a book of the same name), but also forever in conflict with each other over a woman who has a pretty scary habit of being a pyromaniac! Good special effects (especially in the end), bizarre performances by a rather talented trio of actors and topped by a truly interesting and oddly-sounding soundtrack, make "Wilder Napalm" a unique treat with movies to watch ... if you can find that is it! On a personal note, I was fortunate enough to speak it (in other words) from the two-dollar bin at my local video rental store. (*** out of *****)
