Bend it as Beckham is filled with exciting scenes, but has a total predictable stroy line. It's about a girl named Jess who tries to achieve her lifelong dream of becoming a famous football player and finally gets the chance when offered a position at a local team. There are so many borders and borders that she faces, which keeps her back, but she is still determined and striving. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a nice light film and wants to be inspired by what people can achieve. The song selections are really good, 'hush my child, just move up ... to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.' Anyway hope it was helpful for your needs in a review. Bend it like the Beckham big flick
