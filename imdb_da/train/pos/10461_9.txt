A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel with the same title, which was just as good, but different from the movie. Really made you think about how you would react if you were in the shoes of the characters. Recommended to anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, ALL! <br /> <br /> Although production is not completely Hollywood quality - no great special effects - still, the values ​​and ideals depicted more than make up for it. And the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the destruction that occurs when one of them becomes ill. <br /> <br /> You will not miss this!
