I picked this movie up at my local library. After meeting the director at a film festival last year, I was curious to "check out" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a fresh look at familiar topics, love, adultery, friendships, jealousy. It can be a bit talky at times, but never as much as completely sinking the movie. I enjoyed seeing a love story with signs that clearly belong together and seeing them make conscious decisions rather than coincidentally "falling" into something as important as love. The contrast between this movie and the average low-budget shoot-em 'black film is completely different. Check it out. If you are lucky, your copy comes with a copy of the soundtrack that mine did. Good stuff!
