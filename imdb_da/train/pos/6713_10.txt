I liked this TV show because it was its own thing, a girl on her sixteenth birthday find out that she is a witch and her, she lives with her aunts in the house, and they are both Witches too. Well it took her a couple of weeks to get used to. When she used her power for the first time, it was so fun because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to come back and repeat one day. This series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series, but it was thin when she moved out of her house and into an apartment with her colleagues, and then it became boring and I stopped seeing. I loved her aunts, they were so funny and the other was really ditzy. I loved Valerie, and I hated Sabrina's enemy Libby, she was ugly.
