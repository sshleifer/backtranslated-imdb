I liked this movie kind of reminded me of my marriage. It's very clean, you can see it with the family. Very nicely finished. Songs are also okay. I think the author's director is great. The film shows how marriages progress through time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their lives portray the picture beautifully a few steps in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogues are pretty good. The film depicts complex human emotions very nicely with over dramatization. Also showing perfectly is after all not so perfect. Showing very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
