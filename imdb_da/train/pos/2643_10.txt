I really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said. I haven't seen the movie in 25 years, and recall it has never left me. I've searched for it anywhere. I have just searched for it in the past, but came up empty. Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who was in it, but I was only about 10 or 12 when I last saw it, and I wasn't even sure if I had the right movie name, so I decided to do another search and I finally found this view. I was right. If anyone knows where to get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com I really appreciate it. And for anyone who hasn't seen this movie and has the chance of it, it's worth it.
