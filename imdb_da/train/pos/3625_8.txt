This is the best picture about baseball as Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths turn on the screen with a great story and a throw that worked properly enough to pull you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Laced with dreams - in fact, the American dream reckons after 9.11 with a true story of Devil Ray's midlife rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native West Texan better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection ?? cast as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It is true. Screen chemistry works. If you like baseball heart-warmers, you'll love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in there. My popcorn became "a la mode". <br /> <br /> Hey: buy the CD! The music cuts and carries the story splendidly! Synchronization of words and music pushes the story forward exactly as it should, an area that disappoint me more often than not. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would have given the baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us all about ?? character and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never found their place in history to open and close around them. A little long. Worth every minute of last analysis. 8/10. <br /> <br />
