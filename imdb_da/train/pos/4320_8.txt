This highly underrated movie is (for me) what good writing in a movie should be about. The canteen takes the search for meaning in our lives and puts it to everyone to see and wonder. The film is about the parts that people create to isolate themselves from everyday violence and hatred and bigotry. <br /> <br /> Along the way, we are asked questions about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself: "Should I make a violent movie (and in addition to our enjoyment of it) that causes the violence in society?" Claire asks, "What kind of world does something throw as valuable as a human life?" Mack is not immune when he asks: "Is it possible to go beyond the boundaries of race and (an even harder step) of funding? These are of course not quoted from the film but generalities. Others also ask their questions and honestly they are raising more than it answers. <br /> <br /> But it is the nature of life, and we strive to find answers to questions that we never fully answer, and in some cases we have to answer our own needs and desires. As human beings, we thrive on questions we can't answer. Some answers are real. Claire and Mack argue that while they could take the easy way and let the state take the child, their found the responsibility for her life in their Some answers are not. Davis `sees the light 'and decides not to make violent movies, but the next day turns around and rejects his epiphany as subordinate to his art. <br /> <br /> We all seek answers This movie doesn't respond to them, it reminds you to watch me d the answers. <br /> <br />
