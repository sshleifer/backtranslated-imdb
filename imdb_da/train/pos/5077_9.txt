Indian film characterizes the police of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the evil ones. The honest guys are always shouting at the top of their voice and fighting for the system, while the bad police are enjoying it most, but are suffering at the end. <br /> <br /> At least this movie breaks this usual formula and provides a refreshing view of the police and their lives. The direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious policeman, who. The music is interesting, and editing is a trend set as far as Indian film goes. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow at times, and the dilemma Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is played at times. But I still want to give this 9/10 simply because it has many leads to its credit.
