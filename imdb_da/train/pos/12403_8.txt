You would be forgiven that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at managing an American horror movie (especially a hero in an American prison) - see this to prove yourself wrong! It was nevertheless produced in the 80s and the film was made on a budget more appropriate for a modern DIY TV commercial (something I think someone would really notice today, with almost everyone accustomed to $ 100m + budgets for action movies, unfortunately dominate the industry's minds!) Is Mr Harlin's first major production and it - at least what would today be considered a cast. I still believe that most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with Stellan Stargaard's screen performance (without mentioning the thoughtful Mr. Bergman's direct action) - at least for all female viewers - but this flick really shows that there is a good film talent outside the United States and Hollywood to make us see a movie in excitement. Try to watch this movie, even if you're not a horror puff, IMO it's definitely worth it!
