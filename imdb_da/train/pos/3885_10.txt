I was first introduced to "Eddie" by friends from "across the lady" who know I like intelligent humor. I prefer comedians who can be provocative while entertaining like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress to kill', Eddie gives the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the time, which causes your page to split at the same time. There are a wide variety of topics in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece about how to decide Englebert's stage name will leave you in masks! <br /> <br /> Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
