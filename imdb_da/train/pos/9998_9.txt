Seeing as the voice average was pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "just ok" did not have many expectations when I rented this movie. <br /> <br /> However, unlike the above, I enjoyed it very much. This is a charming movie. It didn't have to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the start. Mel Brooks gives a good performance as a protagonist, I think a little different from his usual persona in his film. There are not many knockout jokes or anything, but there are some pretty fun scenes, and generally this is a very entertaining and very easy to see movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
