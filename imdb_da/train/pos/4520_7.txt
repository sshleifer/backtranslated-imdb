Something too long and going over the top towards the end, this comedy is a totally wonderful, never discouraging or ridiculous look at the problems of a "power man" who likes to wear women's clothing on nite. <br /> <Julie Walters is lovely as always, but Adrian Pasdar is completely credible and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely beautiful in high heels and silk stockings.
