The moment I started to see this, I realized I was looking at a quality production, so I wasn't surprised to find that the manuscript was written by Andrew Davis and produced by Sue Birtwhistle, both brought us the excellent 1995 production by Pride and Prejudice! So my only gripe is that Emma did not drive to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The action was amazing, with I think Prunella scales were excellent as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as much. The language is a pleasure to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having the right to go on someone without pronouncing a sword word? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith in reality casting was the place of much as it was with pride and prejudice. I liked it so much that I saw it twice in two days !! So once again thank you to the BBC for another quality piece of television. I've seen the Paltrow version, and that's okay, but I think the BBC version is much better. An excellent production, which I am very happy to own on DVD !!!
