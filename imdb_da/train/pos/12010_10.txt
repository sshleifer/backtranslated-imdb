Warning: mild spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands out as a fantastic - actually moving episode in American history and the world's religious history. This film depicts events in Joseph Smith's life as Mormons reckon as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. So far I've seen the movie twice in its first month with public viewing. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is first and foremost the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who needed an operation at a very young age. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the connection between the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayers, leading to what Mormons call the first vision, were interestingly portrayed. Jesus' face is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands. The rejection from religious leaders and many in his little New York community is sweet at least a little by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This movie does not obscure the events of Mormon Church history, but just jump from scene to scene. This is not a criticism - just a note about the style. The practice of tearing and removal is shown, and it is particularly dramatic and moving when Joseph preaches the Savior's love with an honorary face. from being attacked. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the film demonstrates the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church, while the ever-deeper resistance spreads into the heights of local governments. The film shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments depicting his relationship with Emma. An attempt to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his hard love for his wife, his endless love of children, his joke, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and his compassion. <br /> <br /> When Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage, never to come home alive, most of the characters from the entire movie, whose life had been touched by Joseph, appear and help strengthen what was already seen but creating the last scene to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joseph's and Hyrum's martyrdom is depicted, and filmmakers are back to consider the events they have just experienced. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie I adopted, it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that's the case, even though I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and exacerbates the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how outsiders will see the movie - whether they just want to see it as propagandic, an epic story of an American religious man or something else. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully shot, family-friendly, moving and hopefully something good for everyone. The fact that the events depicted actually happened in these United States is interesting to consider in the light of the many aspects of our culture - including the freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) of the law - we moderators take for granted.
