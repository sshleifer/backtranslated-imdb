The only word that sums up this movie is quirky. It is a light hearted body through an existential concept. jump (more than one) and a little nutty. I wouldn't even call it a big and unforgettable movie theater, and it doesn't seem to be as memorable as the director's first movie "cube" but it's a good pit fluff to watch on a Sunday morning. The play jumps from respectable to annoying at times, but I think that's how it should be written. Made as a serious movie, it might have been good or perhaps very well entered into a state of pretension. Little as the "Matrix" meets the "head" meets "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
