Good sequel to Mord in a small town. In this one, Cash and his police Lt. mate solve a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch and a family of screws and their helpers. As in the original, the viewer is treated to a lovely little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds from pre-war America. Go see it.
