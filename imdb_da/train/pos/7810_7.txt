What is "Cry Freedom" as? It is simply amazing and unique experience in the production of South Africa and how black people in the country were oppressed by white people. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles where he critically speaks of views on Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon, Woods meets Biko and he changes his views on him, and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing for black people in South Africa (right from the top, even from the chief of police). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides to write a book about him and whatever he has to publish. But Woods must escape from his country to get the book published, and he must also put his family in second place so that the world can find out the truth. Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with the main message that black and white are the same because we are all human beings. History leads us to South Africa, and this (movie) is a great way for the whole world to learn what happened in this country and I am disappointed that only 3,200 people have rated this film. This is a movie from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story could not be presented in a shorter way because the instructor wanted to show us how hard it was for Woods to get the book published after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko was also good, as were the families of the two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes victims must be made (Biko's death) so that the truth could be revealed (Wood's book).
