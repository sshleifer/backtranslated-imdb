Don't waste time reading my review. Go and see this amazingly good episode, which may well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murdered her son-in-law to avenge her murder on her daughter. Columbo is his usual spaceship, befuddled and far wiser-than-he-thinks himself, and this particular episode has fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this is not written by Shepherd's creators Levinson or Link may be the closest, most thoroughly original and twist-laden Columbo plot ever. Completely satisfactory in almost all departments and crowded with toll and witty dialogue and thinking. Really unexpected and inventive climax tops all. 10/10 ... search this on Netflix!
