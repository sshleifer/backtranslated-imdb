I rarely see a movie that I am completely confused about; this was one of them. It had good plays, dialogue, plot, and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed loudly, many times, especially the stage that deals with the kitchen ramp. The slapstick comedy performed by lunkhead hired hand had me a floor, but I admit I'm a sucker for slapstick. The story dealt with a group of people in their 30-year-old who came back to a summer camp that they had attended for 20 years earlier. It was a farewell week with camping as the place was closed permanently at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looked different, and they felt different about it and each other. I recommend this fun, live movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
