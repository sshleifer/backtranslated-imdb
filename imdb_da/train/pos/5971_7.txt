Skippy from Family Ties goes from pure-cut to metal kid in this rather cheesy movie. The movie seems to be made in response to all the disturbed parents who claimed metal music, turned their children to evil or cause them to kill themselves - except here is a dead satanic metal star trying to get back from the grave (by help from Skippy to help). And while the plot is corny and cliche, the grain (for example, an evil green mist takes out a girl's clothing) and the soundtrack is what makes the movie so much fun (and great). And of course, there is nothing that Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher asking what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to have a few friends over for a good laugh. And while you are in it, it makes a dual function with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there is a "bad rocker" (as indicated on the video box) teasing murderer in black leather with fringe. One should watch for cheesy movie fans.
