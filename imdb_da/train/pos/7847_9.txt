Believe it or not, in 12 minutes this movie (for 1912) is a full-length movie. Very, very few movies were longer than that then, but it certainly is not what sets this odd little movie apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (with the exception of a seed) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This simple, little domestic comedy could have resembled many productions with the main characters Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead use this Russian production bugs (or I think models that looked like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were not yet to be discovered, and I assume that Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought incredibly well - and a lot more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Mr. Beetle sneaks off for a good time. He goes to a weak club while his wife is supposedly waiting at home. But unfortunately for Mr Beetle he is caught on camera by a local film bird. Plus, he does not know, but Mrs Beetle also continues with a bohemian jump hall. Of course, there is much more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is aged and very entertaining for both adults and children. <br /> <br /> Nice but also great and tough.
