People claim to be edited fun, but they had to cut it down significantly in post production. I have harry as a professor right now on ucsd, and honestly it is one of the best classes i have had, it is quite fun to here about what happened in making the movie because harry is so animated. I originally saw "the joy of life" for another class, where Harry made a voice over in the movie, and began to watch this movie after I started the class. Harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you, especially when you need to edit things until you hit that moment, but that's something you see in this movie.
