A wonderful movie by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as genuine and what is genuine, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from each other. Beautifully shot and acted, though David Niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old as his character claims to be. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think while I saw it and afterwards.
