This criminal thriller is like a film noir, but changes the post-war context to the Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", policemen are good guys, criminals are real guys, and the only enemies are "The Commies" who are ultimately differentiated from the good people because they are emotionally personable and driven by a real care for worth their own, as evidenced by the constant recorded close-ups that speckle the film. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around characters. The personalities of this movie are rather unique and detailed: Skip the pocket that is able to stare at any danger and sometimes as they go through their personal belongings; Moe informs who is just trying to rescue a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and audiences); Candy, the insignificant innocent girl who only thinks she is doing government work and does not fully understand the conspiracy she is involved in; and Joey, ex-boyfriend evil Commie baddie, trying to hide everything from everyone and ironically is the worst person to do it. Throw in a lot of very colorful entertaining characters (like the chopsticks and policemen) and "Pickup on South Street" treat you to a splendor of personalities as they chase down the mysterious and unintentionally stolen microfilm frames. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
