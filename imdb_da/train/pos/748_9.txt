This is 2009, and this undervalued gem has not lost any of the power it had 31 years ago. It connects a fairly wide range of different characters and stories without being cluttered. Clothing and music may have changed over time, but in the end it is a story that will never lose its way to -dateness. And especially this movie does the job pretty well. Of course, it is sometimes fun, but also very touching. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster's performance is striking, and it shows that she is truly a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier films. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one.
