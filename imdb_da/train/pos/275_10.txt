This movie starts with a family who all went in different directions, and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne) who suddenly enters her daughter and Zack makes out and then all sorts of problems seem to surface. Jill Dunne has a man who always travels or gets away from home quite often. There are also major issues that arise when the family decides to go on a camping trip that their daughter Olivia does not like and just cannot adjust to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out of all bugs. In many ways, Olivia has an excellent performance as a teenager and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) provides a great support role as a hotel owner. This movie will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a movie full of horror and terror. Enjoy
