When DEATHTRAP was first released, the poster featured on the front of this DVD offered a graphic related to a Rubik's Cube. It is an appropriate picture: Originally written for the scene by Ira Levin, who wrote such memorable works as Rosemary's Baby and The STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters, and under Sidney Lumet's direction translates to the screen very good . <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of the movies that it is very difficult to discuss in order to do so in some detail, giving away the plot itself as it is known. But the opening principle is extremely wise: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery games, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends a script for a game he has written. It's called "Deathtrap", and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Just the kind of blow that would revive his career ... actually a hit to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the game, events suddenly start to twist in the most unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer is as exciting as SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is truly a story more at home on stage than the screen - To achieve full power, it has the immediacy of a live performance. Still, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it is a more than respectable display on the screen. Much of this is due to the casting, which is remarkably fine. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is fun and endearing as Sidney's relentlessly eager wife, and Christopher Reeve provides what can be the best single in his unlucky short-acting career. If you can't see it in a first-class theatrical production, this will more than do until one comes together. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
