Although certainly not the best movie I've ever seen, it was definitely worth $ 8 (which can't be said for many movies these days.) This was a pleasant account of a true story, although many of the details of the real story was twisted for the film, ie. Billy Sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) Of course, Robert DeNiro was good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. , was also impressive.
