Only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot for the movie, yet Moonwalker for this day is a fun party with music, dance and entertainment. Starting with the montage of videos from Jackson's long career, it reminds the viewer why he is often considered 'The King of Pop'. From its hit 'I want you back' to 'We are the World', the award-winning charity for Africa. Then, a short film of the kind, even though it is missing in an Oscar-winning script, provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. Ends with a perfect (sexy!) Rendition of 'Get Together'. Something the whole family can see and enjoy.
