When I first started to see this anime, I never thought anything about making bread could actually be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started to see it, anime just went into the world of bread, I was hooked. The biggest advantage of this anime is the humor that is very intelligent and very fun with some recurring gags. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these disadvantages are not seen so much in the first episodes, because of the great work on this anime, it really begins to show in the last 20 episodes when the reactions and recurring gags just become old and not as fun as before. <br /> <br /> As for me, if this anime had ended with episode 52, I would have given it a 9, but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste that unfortunately cannot be washed away by the amazing 50 episodes . <br /> <br /> 7/10
