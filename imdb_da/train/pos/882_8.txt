I picked this up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised. Lots of tight, expressionist camera work, an equally tight script and two amazing actors all to make a very fine piece of film. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather the true aficionado of cinema. If Hollywood ever gets its ugly hands on it, I'm sure it will ruin it. A choice treats all around. Other posters here have more than amply sung their roses, so I don't have to bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice and mine and do not miss this gem. Call it what you like; I call it two hours of entertainment well spent. Read my lips: Don't miss it.
