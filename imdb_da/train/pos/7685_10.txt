Another Norman Lear hit the problems African Americans had to undergo in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> With Esther Rolle and husband together with 3 children living in a Chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood, the show showed which black people went through with a landlord (black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as prices and the daily problems that just existed. <br /> <br /> The three children described how people seem to face their problems differently - from the comic JJ to the militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter, who also hoped to succeed. This show was a perfect description of African-American life.
