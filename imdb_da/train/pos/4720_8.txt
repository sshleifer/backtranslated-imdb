A beautiful movie, especially if you like horses, World War II movies and the tight Hungarian plateau. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. The horse race is spectacular as well as the protagonist's horse in his own training. I want to buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. And good '' Family Nite '' movie. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of a certain death from a Nazi who had his own personal reasons to hunt down Brady. A scary beautiful movie.
