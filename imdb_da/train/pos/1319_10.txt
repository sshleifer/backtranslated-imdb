This movie is very fun. I recommend that you see it yourself and then see it again with your friends. I did last night and it was fascinating how well Norma Khouri could pull everyone into her world! I felt a little strange seeing my friends go through the same roller coaster as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a good movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talks about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a woman almost up to Norma Khourio's level, but not how close to the same size ring. He fooledtons of very happy and rich people at my old Berkeley CA A.A. group where everyone trusts everyone else. He wanted to "sponsor" only people who seemed very good to do. Who knew he would have stolen over 100k (in 1987 when it was real money) after being in town for only 1 month. His victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week to be sober. He was wicked with a big laugh and a good smile on his face. The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did for her old neighbor. But I don't want to give anything away. <br /> <br /> I just found this one night on a movie channel, "Showtim", I think. This is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally fooled into seeing something and getting your mind blown. Just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them anything. It's a very entertaining movie, it moves fast and never gets bored. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic at all times. I think all big movies eventually rise to the top. The time will be very good for this movie. I'm just sorry that no one has heard of it yet, in some ways the surprises make even better. <br /> <br /> The manager and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie!
