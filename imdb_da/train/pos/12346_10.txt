This is a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Magnificent music score. I've been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The camera's movement is fantastic, as well as the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and friendly and it is very well brought on screen here. The director plays great with light a color and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once you've seen this movie, you'd like to see more from the same director. It's a really good movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
