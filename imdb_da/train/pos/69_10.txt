I was upstairs with lowered cable channels one night and ran into this movie from approx. 10 minutes into the beginning - every time I thought I was going to bed, something about telling me to continue seeing it, even though it was far past my bedtime. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun movie, but instead chose to investigate the aftermath of the shootings. And even better, the movie continues with real life - just when you think they have to take the easy and of course built-up path, get a twist together and change the whole view of the movie. This movie not only follows the formula, it shows how other events often lead to and / or affect what happens afterwards. <br /> <br /> I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues of anti-depressant drugs more - the Columnbine kids who made the sliders were on them for years, and it was scary to see how Deanna showed them every time started. Until recently, they were dispensing the things like sweets and only now do they begin to understand the long-term effects the substances have. It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given a lot of movies, if one had a relative suffering from a mental illness, I can say that the film was deadly in all aspects of mental illness. Bravo to the director and author, who of course did their homework on these issues. And for those who think some things couldn't happen in a hospital (I don't want to tell you anything), you're also badly wrong - I've been there. The script was so right, it was great. <br /> <br /> Go buy this movie and show it to your teenage children before it's too late. Today they want to thank them.
