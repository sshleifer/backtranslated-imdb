I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was completely connected. The story of a group of surfers running the big waves, waves that are huge, waves that would make any rational person away in terror, is one that manages to be spectacular and makes you understand why people are using theirs. life and hunting waves. There is nothing special about the film, except that it brings together some very interesting people who are in love with what they do and let them talk. Sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. Here is a bunch of guys who are so excited about what they do that it crosses over to the people who see. Halfway into this movie you would like to go and learn to surf as well. Few documentaries have ever managed to unite the passion that these people have, and it is the film's ability to make us feel what makes this a good movie. See it.
