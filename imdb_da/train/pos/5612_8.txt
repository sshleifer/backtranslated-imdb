In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom, where the former tenant, the Egyptian scientist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange) committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the hard landlord Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) establishes strict behavioral requirements and Trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone in the hospital and turns to his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that his landlord and neighbors are planning a scheme to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The weird "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and eerie tale of paranoia and delusion. The story and process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky develops slowly in a nightmare atmosphere in the cruel location of his apartment, and what happens is completely unpredictable. The performance is amazing and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The Tenant")
