I knew about but had never seen Gray Gardens before I saw Broadway musically with the same name. Friends warned me that if I hadn't seen the movie, the music wouldn't make sense. It did, but it also asked me to rent the movie. At first I thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, screaming signs, and it was very hard to see. But being able to stop it, digest it and go back to it made me realize why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable, and their complete lack of self-awareness is worth witnessing. Both have remained beautiful in spite of their break-in age. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and no doubt some men) and make you examine your own relationship with your mother. At a time when reality television and cinema are commonplace, it is fascinating to see the Mayles' work three decades ago, and realize what impact the movie must have had. <br /> <br /> I echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such a shadow of their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s escape the reality in such a complete way? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend seeing this with the commentary track, which gave me further insight into the film.
