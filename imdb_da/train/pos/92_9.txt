This is no art-house movie, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lots of beautiful people, t & a, and action. I found it very entertaining. It shouldn't be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also fun, which is just gravy. Definitely worth the rent. So in summary, I recommend checking it out for a little Friday evening entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to watch other girls get it!) <br /> <br /> The bad guys are also good. Vinnie, Corey Large, the hateful guy from Heroes. Very unpleasant villains.
