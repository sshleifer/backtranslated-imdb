<br /> <br /> There is STAR TREK canon - lots of it. From canon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, locations, initial contacts with new creatures, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE largely ignores the ST canon. An unfortunate fact for a long time serious fans. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first episodes of TOS and retro back from there - but no. <br /> <br /> Like the technology, the phase guns look much more modern than found in TOS. An old style Starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect - that's what I expected to see. I also didn't expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to TNG, but far apart from TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the earliest view of the TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect - a little old raft. With ENTERPRISE we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is more military code in the STAR BLAZERS comic book than in ENTERPRISE. It's good that Captain Archer is uncertain about the needs of the universe (quite unlike Kirk, who never lacked confidence in his use of human justice), but within ENTERPRISE everyone looks like an equal. Unprofessional, uncertain, more distant from the formula to formal military service than found in any ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> The casual country music opening theme song pays tribute to the travels of a family rather than the adventures of a major military vessel. ENTERPRISE seems to show us a most fun, warm-soft exploration of human relations rather than taking on a historical, brave, greedy, loud-seated exploration of space. <br /> <br /> I would have chosen Adrian Paul to play the captain and an elderly man to be the doctor. Still, I liked the actors most of the time. Linda Park, an excellent ballroom dancer from Boston College, is sure to develop nicely. People who make up the crew seem to be carefully set up. ENTERPRISE is starting to run stronger than the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
