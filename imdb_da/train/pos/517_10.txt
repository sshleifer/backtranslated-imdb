Pressburger and Powell's biggest movie. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but gets another chance in life when the sky discovers he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The scene where the young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, arriving in heaven to be treated for eternal life, is unbearably gripping. Also watch out for Roger Livesey, a deeply understated actor, and Kim Hunter as the interest of love (later of course Zira in the Apes Plane). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg cast the actress, who played the main angel (Kathleen Byron) as the older wife of the solitary private in the Saving Private Ryan half a century later, an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic skills.
