While the story of a restless child turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management is nothing new, the story has given a new twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems in school. She just can't stay away from fighting. At home, she's always fathering her down. Her brother coaches boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up, she decides that she will also train. It would be easy to call this movie a "Rocky with Girls" I guess. But that is not at all what this is about. The story actually goes much out of the main character, who is a girl rather than a boy. This way, you can handle multiple problems at once. First, the problem with her is not accepted because she is not a girl and then when she comes to boxing gymnastics because she is at all a girl. It is also a story of how a purpose can change the life of life. How positive things can make you grow. I don't want this to sound pretentious, because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all, but what I say is true. Michelle Rodriguez is also very good at the lead. It's really a shame that she's stuck in the "hard girl" style now, because it's really not what her part in "Girlfight" is about. Of course she is a female boxer, but it is the more sensitive moments that really make her shiny. So maybe it's basically your average underdog story with a twist, but it's lifted far above the amount of Rodriguez's performance. I rate this 7/10.
