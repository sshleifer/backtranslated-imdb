Tom Hanks as if you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Death of Angel". He is a hitman for his surrogate father John Rooney (Paul Newman) an older Irish mob. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) testifies to what his father is living and both are soon on their way for seven weeks, robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of images of dead mobsters. Filmed beautifully to capture the drama of life in the 30s. Sometimes the pace of the bog goes, but then an outbreak of graphic violence keeps the story back. Director Sam Mendes leads this powerful drama on loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bonding of a secret man and his young son. Other notable cast members are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks turns out to be excellent in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
