This is a moral comedy, so it happens in some cases a gentle bitterness, but a lightness softens all sarcasm and irony flows for a moment for a moment to stop your heart and change everything. <br /> <br /> This film, wonderfully written and directed, is a gem that shines perfectly, with beautiful plays by everyone. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual, and Romy Schneider is a gem, perfect and glowing, one should not miss. A truly wonderful movie !!
