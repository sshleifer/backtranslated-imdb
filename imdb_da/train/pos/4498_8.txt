Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well run by everyone. Another couple of 'grinning' moments interfered with some very serious observations about fidelity, aging and parental aging / Alzheimer's problems. <br /> <br /> Quirky guitar music added the story as well. </ br /> <br /> While I have been a fan of Mrs Annis since the "Lillie" (in the 70s) and Mr. Kitchen since 'The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I have only recently discovered Mr. Green ('Me and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), which causes me to question - why had I not seen 'reckless' until recently? !! Admittedly more of a 'chick flick' than anything a man will sit through, it's perfect for a rainy afternoon lazy view.
