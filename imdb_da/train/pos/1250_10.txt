Sometimes I get angry with the apparent apathy of a small number of (oddly very high) Americans, but I have to remember that many people here in the United States were not raised or raised to worry about anything outside their comfort zone. God help us for what we have done. after the relative ease we did for the Native Americans, and the indifference to the horrors of slaving on a race, you would think we would have grown hearts and souls in the late 60s and early 70s 's. But now I see that it is OK as long as our ends are only entitled to us. So how can we look at any other dictator and terrible government and think we somehow make it good to impose our will? We are contradictory and hypocritical, and I am ashamed of this. I feel sad for the people concerned. They deserve justice and their home back.
