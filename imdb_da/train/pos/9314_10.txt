Only saw this show a couple of times, but will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It's very frustrating that it's so hard to find this anywhere to buy and yet there seem to be endless repetitions of things like friends! Especially even harder to get to be in England I think ..? <br /> <br /> They say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from Bakersfield PD itself? Maybe it was just too wise for some people? <br /> <br /> In any case, just about the one comedy I would love to see again, but it's almost impossible to find. I hear it's been or has been repeated on another network? But unfortunately not in here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Ingenious.
