This movie moved me beyond understanding it is and will remain my favorite movie all the time, mainly because it almost all emotions are rolled into its 157 minutes. What is the most difficult part for me to take is that when I want to hear the great music and songs from the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player so I wonder if anyone knows who is singing the songs in the movie And where they can be found, as I have seen everywhere, I can think sporadically over the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie is when in court says the lawyer "But your own words ask for direct confrontation, isn't it a direct call to violence?" Biko answers "Well you and I are in confrontation now, but I see no violence !!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
