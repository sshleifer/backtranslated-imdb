I caught this movie on T.V. last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a great actor in the movie and it was great to see him in something other than the 70's show. The movie is not rated, but in my suggestion I would rate it (R) just because of nudity and lots of adult content. But all in all I loved it, I thought the wisecracks of the dirt were pretty funny. It's just about a guy who doesn't have a job, girlfriend or money and finally gets a job as a private investigator (more of a messenger really.) He gets hit by the murder of a rock star and the rock star boyfriend is one of those people who really need to help him out. I give it ... *** 3 Stars.
