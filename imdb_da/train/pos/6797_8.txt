Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why, but treat it as a low budget serial killer movie and you might get more of it than most. I thought this worked out in a way because I felt the subsequent dirt and wanted to take a long shower so it's a certain degree of success isn't it? <br /> <br /> I would say that there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin, even though the play may be a bit uneven. David Hess is only in this brielfy so don't get your hopes up too much if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> Other than that - worth seeing.
