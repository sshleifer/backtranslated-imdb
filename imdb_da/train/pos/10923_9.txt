This movie is really good. The reason that works as a puzzle strengthens the viewer to think and guess what will happen next time. Such a trick gives many surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solving a riddle. Fighting situations are very good. There are many different fighting styles (though one of the styles was a little unreal to me, but it's just my opinion) to see and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be annoying is the appearance of the actors. A little too little (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies, especially in the 70s and 80s, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) is a good choice.
