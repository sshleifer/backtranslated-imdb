I have recently seen Caprica again and thought I might as well come and write a review! I saw the first thing right after I saw the show's final of Battlestar Galactica (being a great cooling fan boy in the show, getting me to cling to everything I could in the universe), so I didn't know what to expect. ... but I came out with a smile, though I have to admit ... The story starts dramatically on Caprica's planet and we are introduced with a number of interesting characters ... I don't want to give away too much, but there is a dramatic event, who dictates the course of history, but I suggest you see this. <br /> <br /> Must say ... Esai Morales is a hell of an actor, he pulled out a young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral Father's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his action and I think he is the father of William Adama from BSG ... Also Eric Stoltz is exactly in line with his role. ..! Special note it was good to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Don't sit down and watch Caprica expecting it to be like Battlestar Galactica, because the story is pretty straight forward and anyone can see it ... without having to see BSG !. <br /> <br /> This show is a well-written drama for those who like drama with a little sci-fi kick!
