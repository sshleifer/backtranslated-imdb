If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general this is a must-see. Directed by the republic's ace team by William Witney and John English, and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not drill you with the plot (who cares? Less to talk, more struggle); What really matters here is Hadley's excellent interpretation of the character / s and the stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNNING SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence this movie had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro gets caught in the original version of Star Wars trash compactor in a chapter trapped on a rope bridge a'la Temple of Doom in another, moving a Raider's horse-to-trainers and even floating through a tunnel, while the evil ones hit a large water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as Mola Ram does to Indy in Doom's Temple. In addition to all this, the whipping effect is great as Zorro disarms crooks, turns to safety, etc. with its credible lash. Most of the sword work is reasonable to paralyze, except for Chapter 1, which has a stunning sword in a canteen choreographed by sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner, who makes a rare screen like the evil Rodriguez. This was the first series I have ever seen at Matin√©e at Bijou when I was a kid and I've been hooked on them since then. <br /> <br /> Zorros Fighting Legion delivers "Z" items!
