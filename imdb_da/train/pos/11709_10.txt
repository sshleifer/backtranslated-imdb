Now, for all the filmographic buffers out there, this movie might not be high on your list of things to see. But if you know something about plot development, deep truth, and the intentions that this movie (series) had, you would understand my pov <br /> <br /> Permitted is the movie's specs renderings by the author, which cannot be expected to know What will happen in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and just "scares" viewers to think about what may be. I am a Christian, not because of this movie, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential that something resembling the relationships depicted therein can remarkably scare anyone into thinking about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather a means of getting your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I'm not left behind and thanks to movies like this, I can look beyond superficial entertainment, acting and movie budgeting to appreciate the depth that the movie has to offer. This is a movie you should not just watch but feel with your heart and soul.
