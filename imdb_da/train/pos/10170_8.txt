In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this movie was actually surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored with clich√©s, blatant jokes and assaults, all that the trailer had promised. <br /> <br /> But after 5 minutes I found myself laughing and enjoying the refreshing deal. With just one toilet humor gag, Over Her Dead Body actually comes up with realistic fun scenarios, and without destroying too much, some of the moments involving animals are fun. <br /> <br /> The short ingredients of a good movie are all there; script, instructor and actors and compared to other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands high. <br /> <br /> Of course, you won't learn anything or get a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind, you're more than likely to feel good!
