For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha men ever portrayed on the big screen. He is a decent enough young kid who leaves his parents' home and knocks off Dallass's big city, where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him working in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, boom and Texas began to be a growing place in the United States. <br/> <br /> Travolta does a great job of making the audience careful with their character when you get down to it, is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger, who is of the same background, but has some ideas that women should not be shadows by their husbands. And when she hits him in Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, a former judge, works at Gilleys and this movie was his breakout role. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets Travolta's goat with a look and he goes into Winger. Travolta once again takes his rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, to sleep on Gilleys. <br /> <br /> In spite of the signs, Urban Cowboy was really a gigantic advertisement for the self-proclaimed largest honky tonk in the world. Gilley is no longer there in the Texas local area of ​​Pasadena, but memories continue. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of country / western songs highlighted in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs were not specifically written for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason to think about why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. I especially liked Johnny Lee's Looking For Love, if it was specifically written for this movie, it is a disgrace that it was not nominated for Best Song. <br /> <br /> I liked Debra Winger's character best in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but she stands up to Travolta and does so in style. And this review is dedicated to it anyway as an unknown woman who will one day be the first female force in the Professional Bull Riders.
