Of course, I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10 when my uncle was the greatest scriptwriter of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenshots for over 50 years living in Italy. He was a great story counter and someone suggested that he put his stories to write. So Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check out his biography, you can see the number of films made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the most important actor in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city in 1968 to check out places for "A Girl in Australia" and made a great movie about a proxy bride after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently. STORE
