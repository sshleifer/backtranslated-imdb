Clara Bow (Hula Calhoun) is the daughter of plant owner Albert Gran (Bill Calhoun), who is primarily interested in playing cards and boozing with friends. She is interested in riding in the countryside until engineer Clive Brook (Anthony Haldane) shows up to build a dam. One of her father's friends, Arlette Marchal (Mrs. Bane) then competes for his attention. His wife Maude Truax (Margaret Haldane) turns to the rugged finale. <br /> <br /> Lots of 'pre-code' items like nude bathing. <br /> <br /> Wonderful location in Hawaii.
