Okay before we consider, I have to ask: Why is this not specified individually? It may have only been a TV issue in Italy, but for international Lamberto Bava fans, this is their own movie. In America, this movie is distributed on VHS and DVD as either "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "Demons" except for a cast member and crew. But yes, I was personally worried that it was so hard to find on this site, which is otherwise so helpful. Let's finally go through "The Ogre". I've seen the trailer this many times on YouTube and honestly found it quite scary. The movie itself (it's function length, therefore making it a movie) has many many powerful parts and can scare. I was dissatisfied with the last action, but I am not sorry that I bought the DVD before I saw it (available from the Shriek Show). I think the movie's origins of origin explain the last action. I won't give up any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The reason is a little familiar: An American horror writer, who on an old ghost castle with husband and son only finds it resembles the setting of her childhood nightmare. There are weak echoes of "The Shining", but this is another brand of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) is finding more and more evidence that this is the real life of her nightmare, but her husband will not believe in her. Great atmosphere and terror follows. <br /> <br /> The many nightmare sequences were pretty freaky. The ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a little uncle Frank Resurrection from the first "Hellraiser". There are also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene. I give them props that the movie never bowed to imitating American movies with similar concepts, "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "The Ogre" is an original. And the monster itself was a scary as it was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> On the Shriek Show DVD, there is a Lamberto Bava interview where he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic "Demons" series. He also gives a lot of credit to the real castle where the film was filmed. In fact, this setting contributes a lot to the movie. Simon Boswell music also helps. <br /> <br /> There are lots of good things here. "The Ogre" is not perfect, but it is very worth seeing. Take it is a smaller Lamberto Bava performance.
