'Presque rien' is a story of two young boys falling in love with the summer vacation by the sea. I don't want to tell the plot because it's not the most important thing in this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this movie is the cinematography. The visual side of the 'Presque rien' is so amazing, it deserves the highest note. It gives you charm with its beauty. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it is shown in an uneven, rather complicated way. There is no simple chronology or there are answers to all the questions the movie brings. But that's what makes the 'Presque rien' even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of movies is very important and they are not disappointed.
