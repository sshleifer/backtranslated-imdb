I'm not a big fan of camp kitsch and "so bad is the good" type of view. But I really like this movie for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is unlimited enthusiasm, but with some amazing actors and contemplated direction making most of the slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson on how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. You don't like this movie, you may not like this movie. Don't enjoy it, but if you get the chance to see it, save time because chances are you will stop the movie with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor for some great stars. Highly recommended.
