Just like the movie, and the scary thing was that the people who spoke under the movie sounded like the actors. The film had its moments, but also delayed and was pretty sick. It was all supposed to be a father, but when you see people's pathetic life in the movie, you think of yourself. "People like this are all around us." All attempts to make the audience's sympathy blink, as the actors do a stupid thing after another. On the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for video, but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not a beautiful sight!)
