This was of course the prototype of Mick Dundee, but 'Barry McKenzie's adventures are more fun. I was entertained all the time and laughed many times. Outstanding central achievement by Barry Crocker in the title role, an Australian who invades England to disrupt the pockets with his free-flowing creepy ways. Few Britons are disturbed by Barry's often gross observations on his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is stingy but friendly, and this is highlighted by the film's last line, delivered by a somewhat reluctant McKenzie, as he steers the plane home. "I was just starting to like pomsen."
