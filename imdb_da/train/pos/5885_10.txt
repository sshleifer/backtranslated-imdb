This movie was very surprised by me. I didn't have very high expectations, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda were very funny and well-written. They did not spend too much time rebuilding the past, so they did not rely on the success of the old TV show to carry the movie. All in all, it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My boyfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and I think I might agree with her.
