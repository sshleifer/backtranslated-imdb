Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening ... wealthy have done crazier things than this. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I see a comedy to be entertained, escaping from the world's presses for a brief moment, and not having to take anything too seriously. This movie fits perfectly to that purpose. I judge a movie on my own and am not comparing Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles. I saw completely dysfunctional people growing into caring, cozy individuals who could easily live under the streets of my home. It will remain on my list of "favorite ..... must look to the holiday season". If you just want a fun 90 minutes, see it here.
