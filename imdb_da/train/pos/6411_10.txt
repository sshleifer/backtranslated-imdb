This is one of the best military films ever made. And that's good because of its focus on values. It is a great human interest story that changes commitment to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are outstanding in the lead. It is great to see the headmaster's racism develop towards respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, driving and, indeed, honor. The title indicates the source of their bond. I have never noticed before this last time watching how brilliant Carl Lumbly's depiction of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it's a cornerstone of the movie because it's Carl's reminiscent of his father who helps carry him through hard times. <br /> <br /> I am selective about which movies I buy. This is one of the rare things I want on my shelf. It's seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
