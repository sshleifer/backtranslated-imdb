Okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get on the special effects way, but from the beginning Hidden Frontier has consistently provided good story lines and performances, and has always been willing to make mistakes. They advise people to see newer episodes first so they can see how well the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The cast has a great companionship and it appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors who put their mark on the show and with fans also attaches to the show as the story goes from strength to strength. The show has pushed barriers with its various stories - depression, drug abuse and mainstream homosexuality - and it may have rubbed a few people in the wrong way, but that's what Star Trek is about. It depicts these story lines in a smart and emotional way that deals with them subtly and smoothly. Yes, they have used some signs from the Trek story, but they have done them justice - characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, who were very underused in the show, had rebirth in the New Frontier books, but they lost their sizzle after a piece time when Peter David reaches out to wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi, and HF shows these signs in a completely different light that serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and get to know the people involved. They release bloopers for each episode, so fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people who do it in their spare time, with a commitment that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock! <br /> <br /> What this series, which now draws for nearly 7 years, has achieved such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together and inspiring others to do the same. HF will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.
