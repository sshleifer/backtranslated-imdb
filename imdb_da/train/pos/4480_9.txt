In the Citadel movie series The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical. I certainly can't do better than that. It's such an important movie in both career in Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do so well either. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn had the inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own songs and because of that cover the girl became a classic. So if Mayer did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak and allowed Kelly to perform artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dancing rival for the monarch of the cinema dance. The most important number that everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to make the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney didn't lend Mickey out to anyone. Mickey had to wait until who hit Roger Rabbit to make a movie outside. Don't worry because MGM had its own animated rodent half the team of Tom and Jerry. <br /> <br /> Kelly as a dancer has always strived to do something new and different on the screen, like Fred Astaire. For the next dozen years, they got two kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work, even though the films themselves were not up for snuff. It was like each one inspired the other for greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM, and any number of other studies. In Anchor Aweigh, Kelly Sinatra made a little dance. In fact, Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly to show him how musicals should be done when he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift, for their help in serving him is Oscar for from here to eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract purchased by RKO by MGM, he insisted on a little artistic creativity alone. He had become friends with the songwriting team Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In her autobiography, Sammy Cahn tells how Sinatra insisted that they write their songs for this movie. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really nice ballads to him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra songs comes from Anchors Aweigh, I come too fast in love. Frank sings it accompanying her on the piano in an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra's best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn really earned the title of having added more lyrics to Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. They were lifetime friends, and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career. On a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song only using a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchor's Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on all my sudden heartbeats. She also made some classic figures. <br /> <br /> In fact, song is the foundation of the plot. Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet with Kathryn Grayson and her orphan nephew Dean Stockwell. Kelly says he can make her an audition with Jose Iturbi, who is trying to straighten her up with Sinatra. They use the movie that tries to achieve it. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays Brooklyn's waitress, never got the number herself. She had received rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway, and that was what brought her to Hollywood. I suspect she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vault, it can still be. Anchors Aweigh is a good example of why musicals are no longer made. All the creative talent was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If you were to pay the market value for it, the cost could retire to some third world country's debt. <br /> <br /> But the movie results would be extraordinary.
