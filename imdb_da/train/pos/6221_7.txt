Had this movie been put together a bit better, it would be up there with the best of Astaire and Rogers. Like that, it's a great movie, but too long with a dull subplot, that is, Randolph Scott, who has praised Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (it's Ozzie Nelson's wife for you baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two marine men. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later after Ginger Rogers has asked her friend (a blonde but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to cheer her up. Meanwhile, Astaire is trying to pick up where he and his old dance partner relax. The result is some wonderful dance songs, with Astaire and Rogers as a team as well as separate: "I put all my eggs in a basket," "Let yourself go" and "I'd rather lead the band." Hilliard is cute but a little blunt as a regular Jane turned glamorous girl, though she sings her two songs well, "But where are you?" and "get behind me, satan" - a poster didn't care about that song, but I love the title. Rogers is lively, and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo. The highlight of the movie finally comes with "Let's See Music and Dance", one of the most painful beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Astaire. In it they embody the glamor and imagination of the 30s. It really is worth seeing and seeing again and again.
