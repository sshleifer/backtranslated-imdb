I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but he has never read a positive review of this unfortunately misunderstood drama about class sharing, love and sacrifice (three themes most amazing romantic stories or movies have in common). <br /> <br /> Here is the main theme of class sharing. Stella is a story from depression era America. That said, it was translated into the screen so in such a memorable way that this remake (if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two) is not exactly appreciated. Fans of the original never gave it a try. In addition, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, not even a time of great economic problems in America (like depression was). Now is the time to remove the rose-brown glasses in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see that this powerful story still rings true, is timely and relevant as always, in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, the class is the main theme here. Stella is among the poor, simple, with big dreams but a little hope of realizing these dreams. She works in a bar, doesn't have much money, lives in a crummy apartment. You get the operation. In the morning she will not really get out of bed. On her wall, pictures of film stars depict her. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dance at the bar. He is wealthy, educated, from one of the over-class families who have nothing in common with Stella's. His biggest concern is what ivy league college to attend, her is how to pay the rent, how to be 'happy'. They have an affair. They like each other. Stella ends up getting pregnant. Stella tells the guy the news. His answer? "What about an abortion?" She replies, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He delivers balloons and the suggestion, but she sees his heart not in it and has too much pride to accept. She sends him a pack. <br /> <br /> Her daughter has been torn between the two lifestyles â€” the love she has for her mother, and the benefits and happiness and love of her wealthy father. Stella, alone and unloved, and does not want her daughter to become as unhappy as her one day, makes the ultimate sacrifice. She gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to secure her daughter's happiness, and perhaps live with affection and hope, knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for. <br /> <br /> Now, to the movie. Everything is right about it. Beautiful score, artificial filmography, beautiful set design (contrast between the two lifestyles, the messy and decorated mansions), wonderful and inviting performances of the whole role, especially with the Oscar-worthy Bette Means. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is much more significant and well-crafted than you have made to believe.
