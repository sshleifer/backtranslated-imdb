This was just another wonderful movie from the Berlin Festival. But unlike "Yes", of Sally Potter, which I had seen a few days before, after leaving the cinema, I felt a strong desire to want to embrace the whole world and just be happy to be alive this time It went the other way: there was something dragging me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and difficult to breathe. It was as if suddenly there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken away to a dead end. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed to be gloomy and locked, but saw a wonderful day showing the kind of brightness that opens the horizon and making her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. There was no one at her side, but suddenly she found a companion, just outside of nothing, someone who could share the most hidden feelings in her life. That person was Toni, a vagabond girl who didn't seem to have any roots, like herself. <br /> <br /> But the movie's title is "Ghosts", and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to preserve them ?? Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself, hiding away from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is the victim of such ghosts. She once lost her baby daughter in Berlin, who apparently had been robbed by her in a supermarket for a moment with inattention. Now is the time, and Françoise is back in Berlin and is still looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina could be that child, after all, she has the same scar on her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades, which appears to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina adopts the idea she's in desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother. But in the end she is empty-handed, Toni has disappeared from a man, and she thought that mother turns out to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes Françoise's husband, and the statement could not be more disillusioning. Nina is just a "niña", a girl without a name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely life. Therefore, we finally see Nina all alone and go on the path opened to her for a future that seems happy and uncertain.
