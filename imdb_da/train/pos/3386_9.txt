Is it the future that awaits us? An overcrowded, unforgiving wilderness with a healed, unwanted existence? This film brings us in mind a problem that still troubles us, twice since the film was released in 1973. Let us hope that the world will not end as such ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie, I enjoyed a lot. It had sympathetic characters, a semi-apocalyptic attitude, a compelling and thought-provoking story, and macho-est macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant and dirty feeling. You are almost choked by the stench of the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is Thorn. The man created this role as a badass, but still a bad guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him does not listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the beloved Old Sun who has had enough of this unpleasant place. Everyone else is amazing, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment where she lives. <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing, even in 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers who get rid of people) were excellent. The contaminated air outside looks disgusting and very uncomfortable. The empty city streets filled with the vain and crooked people are very disturbing. One final note is the end, which still shocked me. It's cruel, but if you think about it, it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> An excellent 70's science fiction flip that makes you think and leave you feeling very uneasy
