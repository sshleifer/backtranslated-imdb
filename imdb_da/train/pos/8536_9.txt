I recently got the chance to see "The Waterdance" and liked it. I do not really understand why it is called because there is no dance going on, except perhaps for the dance at the strip club near the end. We are introduced to the protagonists of the entire movie, disabled in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you will not see movies here today. I'm not "stuck in a time chain", I'm not saying that everything in the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think the movie industry is getting worse and there's a lot we can do learning from old movies with old movies, i mean everything from 1920-1998.
