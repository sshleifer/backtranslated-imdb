The film begins with a bunch of children in the Reform School and focuses on a child named 'Gabe' who apparently worked hard to earn his parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to get a fresh start, and soon Gabe meets Dead End Kids. The children in this movie are small punks, but they are much smaller antisocial than they had been in other previous films and deep down, they are well meaning punks. But in this neighborhood, there are also some criminals who commit insurance fraud through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat - after all, he had been reforming the school, and no one would think he was innocent when he was framed. So when Gabe is being sent back to "The Big House," it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real villains. <br /> <br /> "Dead End Kids" appeared in several Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s, and the films were generally very good (especially angels with angular facets). But after the boys' contracts expired, they went on to Monogram Studios, and the films, to say the charity, were very weak and formal - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being virtually the whole show, and the group was renamed "The Bowery Boys ". Because ANGELS WASH had their phases, they had excellent writing and production values, and Hall and Gorcey didn't stand up for the camera, it's a pretty good movie - and earn almost a score of 7 (it's REAL close). In fact, while this is not a great movie aesthetically, it is probably very fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Sure, it was a bit hokey-especially at the end when the kids took the law in their own hands, and Reagan ignored the bill - but it was also quite entertaining. Dead End Kids make their best performances, and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support. Sure, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still fun and quite charming - so if you can suspend unbelievers, it works well.
