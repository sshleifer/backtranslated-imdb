The film really challenges your ideas of identity and the society we live in. It is well created and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and reveal the world that exists beyond the normative ideological perspective. I think it gives a good insight into a subculture that shakes the very ideas that the viewer has from society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. Some parts were difficult to see, as most realities are, but it's not over. It's good the first time you see it, but it gets even better the second or third time because you've had the chance to pack your mind around the topics they are discussing and challenging.
