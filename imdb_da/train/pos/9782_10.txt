Peaches are really a wonderful movie. I am writing this to reject a review from someone called 'Auscrit' shown on this site. First of all, the notion that either Monahan's first movie "The Interview" is somehow, TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been featured significantly throughout the world, which is simply one of the best Australian movies ever made. It fully deserves to win the best picture. Peaches are a brave, brave and courageous departure. For me, it works at all levels, and I have seen it twice now. Monahan is a film-maker that demonstrates great skill and incredible sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' to comment that it is another TV movie, etc., And that Hugo Weaving is not good, you simply do not get the 'film'. Or more don't want to get it. Frankly, this is the kind of comment you expect from another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from the industry either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average point I've found is just not commenting as such. I've noticed other comments on the website and reference to the movie Sommersault. You have to wonder what people think they are looking at. Unfortunately in Australia at the time the SS was released, the push, if you didn't like it, was something wrong with you, not the movie. This manipulation of the media is quite common. The reality is the only resemblance between the two films is that they have rights to passages. Unfortunately for me, SS is a movie about nothing, it could have been told about in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film about anxiety. Peaches in comparison is a masterpiece. Personally, I can't wait for what Monahan does next, as he is clearly ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win everyone at this year's AFI and IF prizes, then it's a rigged game. As for Auscrit, you can find something more constructive with your time
