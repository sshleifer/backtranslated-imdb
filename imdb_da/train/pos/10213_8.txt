This whimsical film had the accident released at the same time as the very popular "Amelie", both of whom have the wonderful Audrey Tautou who plays the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most entertaining films that have come out of France in recent memory. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with a chance that the English title indicates. The French title refers to how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic while flying, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something that should not be believed, just by looking at these colorful insects. From the start, the director interacts with all the characters you see in the movie and how each one is connected to each other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the context of the movie seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the movie. Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and continues to read from her paper. Irene, it seems to cross paths and will find her soulmate the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man next to the woman says he has the same birth date as Irene. It seems that they are destined for each other right from the start, but unfortunately they will not reconnect to the film's last frame. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Fodder who plays Younes does not have much to do at the end, but he shows that he is present and plays well. The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode, because he seems to be an instructor with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way people are connected.
