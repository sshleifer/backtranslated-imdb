"Now in India's sunny climb, where I spend my time as a soldier in the service of her Majesty the Queen ..." then the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal foundation on which the movie "Gunga Din" is based. If you are lucky enough to see this legendary Classic, you will enjoy movies that they use to make them; for the pure pleasure. It is a story of a humble Indian native called Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), acting as a "regimental beasty" during the British occupation of India in the 18th century, taken out of the manuscript of the incumbent writer and poet. His greatest desire is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a British Calvary who is threatened with the death of a notorious blood cult of Kali, called 'Thuggee'. Three special soldiers stand out in this company, known for their brave and companionship. First is beautiful and debonair, Cary Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Next is Victor McLaglen as brave Sgt. MacChesney and finally there is flamboyant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three and their fellow soldiers are surrounded by a shadow of mountaineers led by their fanatic leader called 'Guru' (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of the chaos of war is the brave water boy who hopes to earn a place in the army playing a bugle he found. A solid story for an old black and white movie that requires a little fanfare for anyone who wants to enjoy a classic. ****
