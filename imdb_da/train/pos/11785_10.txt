I don't quite know how to explain the "Darkend Room" because summarizing it wouldn't really do it justice. It is a quintessential Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more on the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian spectrum, as opposed to "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story." It's hidden on Lynch's website and it's worth searching for.
