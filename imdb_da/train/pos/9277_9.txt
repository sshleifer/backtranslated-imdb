"The cinema is dead, live the live cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive modern directors of last year's Romanian film festival Anonimul, who came to the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, the directional award went to Jafar Panahi's "Offside". I got to see it tonight in Bucharest on the festival's retrospective. The cinema is dead, but still very lively. Panahi's film convincingly tells how Iranian society looks. Digitally filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by a reality event that happened to Panahi's daughter: The problem and the risk took when you decided to join a football game. This is forbidden in Iran as we are informed. What Panahi manages to do is to do with few means, but probably with a lot of work, intelligence and humor, the cultural patterns of a society that places women at a separate level. The law's absurdity becomes comical. The movie has a happy end, after all because Iran's team goes to the World Cup. What I appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this movie. I would be very interested to see Panahi's other films, which were also banned in Iran. I guess he might be an activist director.
