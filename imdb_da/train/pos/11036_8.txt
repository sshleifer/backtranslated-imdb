A prison cell. Fewer prisoners - Carrere, a young business leader accused of fraud, 35-year-old transsexual in his conversion process, Daisy, a 20-year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who murdered his wife. Behind a stone slab in the cell, the mystery was unleashed, they discovered a book: Diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who recorded the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magic formulas that apparently enable prisoners to escape. "Malefique" is one of the most horrific and intelligent horror movies I've seen this year. The movie has a nasty, shady influence influenced by HP's works Lovecraft, which creates a very eerie and disturbing atmosphere. There are quite a few things involved in some imaginative and brutal death scenes, and the characters from four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed. It's a pity that Eric Valette made a really horrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his amazing debut.9 out of 10.
