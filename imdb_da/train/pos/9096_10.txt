Adorable! I saw domestic imports in Philly in October with my children. We all liked it so much that we saw the second time with my parents. I haven't heard them laugh this year! It was the first time I could remember watching a movie that my parents and children could enjoy. It's really cute, and we can't wait for it to come out on DVD. They have to make several films like Domestic Import. It is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be embarrassed by). I haven't seen a movie this sweet page with Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as the mother. She was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this, and he's fun. I can remember him from the WKRP.
