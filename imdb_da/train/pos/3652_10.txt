I started watching a replay of this television movie on a Sunday afternoon, and thought it was just another stupid airplane catastrophe flick. I was mistaken. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that far exceeds the quality of most television films. It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen. The game is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is convincing throughout. In fact, the final hour is so full of plot twists and excitement that you cannot leave your seat for a second. If you get a chance to watch this movie, invest the time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
