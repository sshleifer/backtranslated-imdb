Romantic comedies can really go in both ways, you know? You will see someone who is really juicy and you think you want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but it may be too boring to keep you interested. Or maybe you will see someone who does everything right but just fails to make you smile. Romantic comedies are hard movies. You enter into them with many expectations, and usually, if you like it, it's just a matter of whether the movie powers predict your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girl next to you and you're a guy like me, it's probably not so much about the movie being good, you have other things in mind. For you, I say, "Go her, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "Look, it's a Guy Thing." It is very fun. Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're entering this movie with expectations, so it doesn't pretend its "Guy will marry meet the woman in her dreams, and it's not his wife!" Plot will make everyone happy. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring right or you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ covers it. What _A Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting mold I've seen for a long time, so if you're not the main plotline, you still have something that can make you smile. <br /> <br /> If we're talking about the spicy veterans of big and small screen, like Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien Regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety) or new faces such as Shawn Hatosy (Faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we talk about a bunch very talented and talented actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the movie's inspired characterization, steal the show time after time and still hit the piece with an energy and a rare rarely seen in romantic comedies these days. And it is not to detract from the actual romantic review and the stars that carry it together because it is very sweet and terrible I am well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) Stirs like the young professional whose life can be out of control, and Selma Blair shows an underestimated brilliance by depicting the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who is actually. <br /> <br /> A great success with the movie, however, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl at the right place at the wrong time, and she's doing well. Not since, I don't know, when did I see an actress in a romantic comedy that made me fall in love with her so easily. It is, of course, all in the close-ups, the voice and the subtle smiles, but it is magical, and that is one of the great reasons why we first go to the cinema. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles A bit of scary sophistication would be lost if it were not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead in their classic simplicity. This is a movie that paints a devastated world of irreconcilable layers, causes them to fall over each other to make you laugh, and then come through with a big heart. A Guy Thing is a movie you've definitely seen before and the filmmakers knew it when they sat down to do it. We haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since Shakespeare; The relative success of this one or the one depends entirely on the performance of the classic story of the boy meeting girl. A Guy Thing embraces it with a bit of metacinematic edge, and often the scenes take in the absurdity to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play. <br /> <br /> For the album, it even manages to throw fun on the rather traditional structural notions of sex and sex that are at the heart of any romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there can get a kick out of it. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your boyfriend why the pharmacy and clothing store is among the coolest dudes in the cinema, I suggest you just say "It's a Guy Thing" and leave it by it.
