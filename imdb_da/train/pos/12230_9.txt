MELTING MAN ... a tragic victim of the space race, he died MELTING ... never understand that the race was far away ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand on kitchen stove. But instead of screaming something, a normal person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie you've popped into is not a normal movie. You've just taken your first step into THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous late-70s gorilla movie featuring Rick Baker's wonderful makeup effects. Baker was right on the verge of becoming a superstar and did so at the same time as his famous "cantina aliens" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name and it was not inappropriate. <br /> <br /> It may have something to do with the fact that this movie is just awfully horrible. From the opening credits ("Starring Alex Rebar as THE INCREDIBLE MEALING MAN" ... that's really what it says!), To the shabby nurse running through a glass door, to the fisherman's head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some stone, this film gives many, many moments of pure incomprehensibility. "Why did they ... but how does he ... why are they ...?" After a while you stop wondering why and see it as it is - a very entertaining piece of waste. <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to earth in a melting, radioactive state; he escapes, and his mind disintegrates as well as his body, begins a sour melting killing. The authorities quickly decide that the merchant should be stopped but will probably not "disturb" the panic, but will have him caught as clearly as possible. Then they send a guy with a geiger counter after him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Storywise is a bit under film. The melting guy wanders around killing people. A doctor is searching for him with a geiger counter. Various characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. Eventually, the doctor puts up the fighter, but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson." The melting man walks out and dissolves into a large sausage of goo. The end. <br /> <br /> It is so brainless that it somehow ends up being very fun, despite a pretty scary ending. Probably a widescreen DVD release is planned. A very special movie.
