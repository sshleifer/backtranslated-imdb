This movie made me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen lots of great movies, even more crap - them. But then the scene ended - Catharically at its core - I came to cry! And if you didn't - you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But that's right - because things have really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything they went through in the early 70s ... At one point it led me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never works really well. But this movie really reminded us of believing it all ... Because they are not trying to make it like a path full of brilliant concerts, current musicians who are superheroes, group girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, they do not harden drugs and alcohol, They promote rehabilitation and redemption, which even comes 20 years late ... Another good movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I was never so moved by a movie.
