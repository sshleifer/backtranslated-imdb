I think the movie was a little strange. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. He is not mentioned again. The special effects could also be better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. It's not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give it about a 5 out of 10 scale.
