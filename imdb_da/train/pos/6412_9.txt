I am certainly glad that a movie about Carl Brashear's amazing life story was made. Brashear became the inspiration for people from all minority groups who were not willing to settle an expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads as an example in the construction of the life he has chosen. Much like Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and made it stick to his character and behavior. As Brashear by Gooding, he doesn't want the life his father Carl Lumbly has, and Lumbly makes it really clear to get more out of life than he has got. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman integrated armed services after World War II, Navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a chef or an officer of the officer, the right fighting parts are denied him. It's not good enough for Gooding, who is looking to become a Navy Deep Sea Diver. <br /> <br /> Once at the Bayonne diving school, New Jersey, Gooding gets it all to him, mostly by Chief Chief Petty Officer, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some remaining prejudices, but he is nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if you can move on to the race difference. The best thing about Men Of Honor is chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, they both appear to be men of honor. Other good ideas are to mention Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy like Navy would want to retire for the reasons you want to see. <br /> <br /> Men of Honor is an inspirational story of people with the courage to save and the ability to change.
