Typically De Palma movies made with many styles and some scenes that bring you to the edge of your seat. Surely what makes this movie better than the average thriller is the style. It has some brilliantly edited scene and some scenes that are really nerve wraps that bring you to the edge of your seat. The best scene is from the movie; The museum scene and elevator murder. There are some mild erotic scenes, and the movie's pace may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. The story itself is also pretty good, but it really is the style that makes the movie work! It can only be for the fans, but also casual viewers should appreciate the well-built excitement of the movie. There are some fine characters portrayed by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice and Angie Dickinson seems as good as she looks good (not bad for a 49 year old!). The musical score of Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma likes and fits the movie very well, just like his score for the second De Palma movie, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant nerve wrecking thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
