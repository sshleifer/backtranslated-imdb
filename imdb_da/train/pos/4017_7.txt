This is a very memorable spaghetti western. It has a great story, interesting characters and some very good plays, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil scab in this movie is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when she is not speaking. Her performance is very credible. She manages to be quite fascinating without being over the top (not that there is anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this movie. <br /> <br /> The music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will play in the head constantly for days after watching the movie, whether you want it or not. There are a few parts that are very funny. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri is dressing in front of the parrot. There is also plenty of smooth gun play that is very well done. <br /> <br /> I'd probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first is a silly barrel fight that occurs about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculously beautiful games I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance figure from a poor musical than any kind of real fight. One might disregard this if it was a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but it is a more serious Western, and the brat really should be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma's fake Mexican sidekick. I suppose he should be comical relief or something, but the sign was simply stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> All that has been said, let me assure anyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the mistakes I have mentioned and all fans of the genre should watch this movie.
