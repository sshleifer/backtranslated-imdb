Trawl through the Sci Fi weeklies section of the local Video Rentals store I lost the hope of finding good movies I had not seen yet. Renting Cypher was like a grove on a possibly very limp horse. My son is so spoiled by the current "B" Science Fiction that he hasn't bothered to see this yet. It should be noted that I didn't see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Now it was a really pleasant surprise! This is also no B movie. It is not a "blockbuster" of the epic assortment and does not attempt to be - more of a silent movie to be seen several times in order for its plot to be fully savored. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerfully presented when used - my only complaint is super helo is a clue of course CGI at first view, but they get it right at the 2nd look and that aside everything else is top notch. In any case, the influence is secondary. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give anything away about the plot. The plot structure has a Russian doll aspect that resembles the basic instinct (though with very different content). <br /> <br /> Only I would say that choosing Jeremy Northam for the lead was a championship. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this movie hits the ear as a kind of extremely forced New England dialect, it's a tad off-key. See the final twist on the plot and you'll see why it's such a great choice! And Lucy Liu is also with her "she wants to kiss me - she'll shoot me" edge. <br /> <br /> I rarely see movies several times within days - this is one of them.
