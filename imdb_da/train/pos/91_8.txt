In general, it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the play was spectacular and the characters were not from their people. I especially liked the plot, even though you knew what would happen, it still gave the element of surprise throughout the movie. However, I find that it could be a little longer (perhaps extended) - for me it seemed like it was a bit rushed; as if the author was trying to remove bedding from the lines before the rain fell. For example - What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For everything we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who set up the whole thing ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a successor? Maybe? If there is .. I can't wait to see it.
