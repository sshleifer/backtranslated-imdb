Before you see, make sure you've seen the Night of the Living Dead ... It may be the best 7 minute parody I've ever seen! Absurd, crappy 'special effects' (felted, rope !!!) and maneating slices of bread ... What more do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Don't watch this movie while eating bread ... you can be scared!)
