I saw this movie the day it came out last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, now it's on video and I saw it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes stupid, but it makes it my third favorite movie all the time. The special effects are okay, but the witty dialogue will make you roll. I'm the kind of person who says I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other things, avoid it. But for everyone else, enjoy! The action is amazing. Hank Azaria is the best hand (neither is he a commander or a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (you can't correct me. It sings me) and then William H. Macy gives his best performance. Praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy. Two issues: The most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the Casanova parole hearing. Some scenes do not speed up the story, but they are a blast. Kinka and especially the authors tend to draw on a scene until all that hilarity is gone, but bam they change and you are ready for more. I swear to have seen this, you will be tired of the explosive climax (which I think was pretty cool) The camera is also cold and moving at a furious pace with the actors. Also, Tom Waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this kind of cool, evil hell jerk to him) and as someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanity to them. Captain Amazing is pretty funny (especially his talk to Casanova about his perfect plan - I rolled) and the rush is pretty cool like Casanova. A beef: The funniest comedian ever (Eddie Izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, a wonderful movie. I give it twenty stars and hope that someday everyone will see the brilliance of the movie's best parody, Six Million Dollar Man one. Laughter right now as I think about it. 10.20
