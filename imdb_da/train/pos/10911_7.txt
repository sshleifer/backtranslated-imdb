Enjoyed this 1936 movie with lots of veteran classical actors and especially William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts" who played the role of a doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane," and was divorced and they still managed to live with each other and also struggle all the time. Paula wanted her husband examine a murder and did everything she could to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a pretty nutty type and there are plenty of 1936 Comedy, and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a California Race Track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" gave a great role as a bookie along with James Gleason, a detective who needs Dr. Bradford's help to solve this very strange killing mystery. If you watch this movie, just remember that it was produced and corrected in 1936, and the folks in the audience on those days thought it was great entertainment and it was really these days!
