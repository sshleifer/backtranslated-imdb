I've seen virtually all Cynthia Rothrock's films, and for me it's the funniest. It reminds me of early Jackie Chan movies. Certainly, Mrs Rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good to see both as a martial artist and as a very sweet young lady. This movie, but probably not the best of all its films, was the most entertaining.
