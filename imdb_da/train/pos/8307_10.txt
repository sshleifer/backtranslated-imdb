Tressa's vocal performance was excellent !! Tressa played the female singer role while Richard was in the club. When she first came out on stage and began to riff and stiffen her stuff, it made my soul shake. Her voice is platinum. She has to make a CD. She has several fans, so she realizes. I loved her show, which stopped the performance in the five heartbeats that she also starred with Leon when she was younger. How can a little girl have a voice so big. She is really amazing. Good voice Good Good Good Good voice Voice voice Very good voice Great voice, back shaking, tears crying, uplifting, taking you back in today's voice. Tressa, if you read this commit, take my advice and start recording a CD. If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. I think you can really do it. Look at these other one hit single studio singers, lol.
