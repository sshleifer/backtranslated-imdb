Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of novela Xica! I know tons of people including myself who would like to buy novela Xica! It is a very entertaining novela set in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city, where the novela is, is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of that period. I wish Telemundo would televere it again, even though it was a 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend seeing Xica if it ever appears again at Telemundo. I have e-mailed Telemundo a million times already to show novela again, but my submissions have fallen on deaf ears. The only warning about Xica is that it occasionally contains some tough scenes, so I recommend that children under 14 do not look at Xica. Overall Xica deserves a 10 out of 10!
