Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been for Japanese men brought to Hawaii by the 19th century to work on the sugar cane. Most came back to their homeland, but few were ever able to do so. Similarly moving portrait is the fate of the Japanese women, some as young as fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as promised brides to men, they only knew through photographs that were often 10 or 15 years outdated or were by another younger man. They also worked long, hard hours on the fields while fighting for homework and to preserve their dignity. Director Hatta's portrayal of an image of the bride's courage and perseverance struggling to survive in a foreign country and foreign society under great physical doubts, is ultimately inspiring and uplifting - a story of moral and cultural survival. There is a greatness and grandeur of sweep of character and landscape in Picture Bride, which captures the astonishing beauty and fierce hardness of the colonial sea. This is a film that is emotionally, intellectually, and artistically rewarding.
