I admit that I had no idea what to expect before I look at this very stylized piece. It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the cold for everything I knew. It began with beautiful visuals, small extracts to grab your attention and make your imagination run wild. As it continued, I quickly learned through voice overs what happened. A lovely little neo noir story that I felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time. The small traces to the audience through pictures in the beginning give them a sense of achievement as they bind together the plot. Along with a nice twist at the end, it is a cool package together. The result, though not bad, gave the film almost a music video feel. It just felt a little dated and didn't add anything to advance the story. Some of the performances felt overly dramatic, but perfectly matched to the feel of the overall piece. I walk away from this very satisfied. I got a lot of information in a short time, but through great editing and voice-over work it didn't feel rushed or pushed. Good work!
