Okay, we have extreme Verhoeven violence (Although not as extreme as other Verhoeven flicks), we have lots of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh yes it lacks the intelligence that Paul Verhoeven is known to. for in his sci-fi movie. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself does not have enough humor to fall into the comedy genre. The overall play was above average compared to most slasher films. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, not the role or the characters, but the amazing special effects that would otherwise make a movie This is impossible. The crew has really made an invisible man without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano lines and other practical effects (effects done on sets). The most amazing effects scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, they are when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. The problem is that this invisible man's story deserves to be more imaginative. Here it takes place in a laboratory for the most part. I would have enjoyed seeing the invisible Kevin Bacon steal a bank and get away with it, or let's say stealing something from people's purses or something. But what appears is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie. Degree: B
