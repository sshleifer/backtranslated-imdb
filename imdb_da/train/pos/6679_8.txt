I'm just making an excuse for this movie: There are far, far, too many wide-angle close-ups, and if they annoy you without endurance, fair enough. They drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so. But then I made a kind of ceasefire with the horrible filmography; and long before the end of the film I had ceased to care. This is a rich comedy that needs to be destroyed so easily. It's funny, it's witty, the comic delivery of ALL of the castings is flawless, and how much Usher comrades on his characters through a cold fishing lanyard - he doesn't care much about them - he manages to present them with warmth. "Mystery Men" is actually not only more fun, not only more wise, but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being. The wit in the Austin Powers movies, for example, as well as being less fun than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The Satyr of `Mystery Men 'bites when there is something worth biting and gnaws gently when not. It doesn't just suck something old. Therefore, contrary to what some (I must consider them unnoticed) critics say, it never runs out of ideas. <br /> <br /> The "super" heroes are an attractive bunch. Sure they are second rate but they are not just the second rate. Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing but throws cutlery in people, and he is not so good at it. On the other hand, he is also not comical bad. He is better in his restricted area than most people, and he does diligently. He is not a puffer, making him a much more fun character than he was. If Superman is Christ in a cloak, Mystery But all the little demons from the foot of Mount Olympus are in capes. Much more fun; also much more endearing.
