I always look forward to this movie when on TV. Must download the DVD. The selection of different types of people is fantastic. It tells me that everyone can be dancers if they try hard enough. My favorite character should be Mr.Aoki. He is so quirky but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with wonderful dancing. Unfortunately, we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would provide the perfect sequel if they had. But I suppose it leaves it to your imagination what could happen. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He stays loyal to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I really don't like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere matches the original more than Lopez. I have a feeling that remake is not so simple and innocent.
