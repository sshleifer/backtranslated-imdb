"Cinderella" is one of the most loved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy tale that Charles Perrault told, the film follows Cinderella, a good girl who has been mistreated by her evil grandmother and equally unlikely place lists. When a king ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: The King wants to get the Prince married), Cinderella is left at home while her founder takes her horrible daughters with her. But there is a Fairy-godmother present ... The story of "Cinderella" alone would not be able to polish out a function, so while it generally remains true to the story otherwise rather random characters of the animals that fairy godmother uses To help get the title character to the ball becomes cinderella true sidekicks. The Jaq and Gus mice are the most important sidekicks, and their own nemesis is the founder's cat Lucifer. Their antics generally interfere with the most important fairy tales, and they are mostly wonderful. It is true that the film lowers a bit between the characters' main introduction and shortly before the actors leave for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really goes back and surprisingly (as "Cinderella" is the most run-down story presumably) ends as one The most involved Disney stories. <br /> <br /> The animation and art direction are lovely. All the legendary Nine Old Men animated this picture, and Mary Blair's coloring and conceptual art (she also made conceptual art and coloring for "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "The Three Caballeros" and many many others) manage to twist on screen. The colors and designs are lovely, especially in the Fairy Godmother and scenery, as well as in the most beautiful little moments here and there. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Cinderella" is one of the best Disney fairy tales and is recommended for young people and anyone who highlights the Disney philosophy that dreams can really come true.
