Great drama with all the areas covered, except for screenplay, which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes such as Pitts character, who interviewed the president, or Pitt gets murdered instead of just having it described to us. as they would have kept the audience awake. Removing some useless minutes could have created more space for more heart-breathing scenes like them. The training of the film kept this from all the time greatness, although seeing Pitt here makes the movie so worth seeing. Also big fans of fising, early 1900s styles and Montana really like this too ........
