Although there are no new episodes, it is rarely shown. I used to love the magical Sabrina and teenage witch. I never saw the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why should the aunts disappear out of the show for good? I'm sure the end went to being perfect. But there are many questions unanswered. And I will see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope she chooses Harvey! And I have to say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad it is too old for myself. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of beauty that she adds to the show, but there are many small "stupid" things for the show, like how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening, it's kind of stupid . Plus, the cat really starts to be paralyzed as the show continued, the jokes just started to be stupid, and the things the sounded "audience" would laugh at, I would think it was so boring. Don't make me wrong, in some parts it was fun, but I think the show just kind of lost its "magic" so to speak, as the show continued. I give kudos to all they threw to try though the Soleil Moon Frye girl had no taste and she was a horrid actress. I wonder what Melissa or any of the casts do now for that matter now that the show is over.
