It takes patience to get through David Lynch's eccentric, but - for a change - life-conscious chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick to it. While it is as slow as Straight's John Deere as he meets those strangers along his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the power of the family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth runs his career with this year's most accomplished achievement, sad and poetic, flinty and caring. And Sissy Spacek matches him as his "slow" daughter Rose, who torments his own private loss while he cares about father. Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about the family.
