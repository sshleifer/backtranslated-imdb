Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. Somehow the manufacturers turned around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuffs. It couldn't have been any other way, because the evolution of the characters is great, as it is depicted in this series, and any change in it could only ruin perfection. (You understand when you've seen all the episodes). <Br /> <br /> In spite of a relatively slow start (the producer took his time to present the characters), things quickly gain momentum, and soon after the middle series, the action becomes so intense to stick to your seat. <br /> <br /> The series topic focuses on the Holy War, which has taken place in Fukuky City for the past 50 years. The pilot actually begins with the end of the previous war and evolves from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started in the last battle and surrounded a large part of the city. He is unwillingly witnessing a battle between two servants, triggering his Reiju (sacred mark) to summon one of the strongest servants of the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned "Such immense beauty ... I was lost to words". <br /> <br /> Do not compare this series with anyone else to fully understand its plot. The FSN offers much more than some cool sword figures, good animation, spectacular light, great soundtrack, it gives excellent character and relationship development. It presents the changes that take place within character personalities such as the events precipitating. The action reveals credible dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of individuals (which do not resemble the linear type of other series), constantly designing their personalities to reveal, from under the full-mask mask, flawed characters. <br /> <br /> The Saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been modified to fit this series and should be accepted as such. You should not see the FSN thinking that it does not present the viewer with the historical fact, just remember that this is the adventure / fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy it as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected, and if there were twice as many episodes, I would have seen them in the same breath.
