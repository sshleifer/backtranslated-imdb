I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorites and one of the cutest actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of his movies but all of Jeremy Jordan's. What I don't like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" rats him out. Twisted Desire is my other favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
