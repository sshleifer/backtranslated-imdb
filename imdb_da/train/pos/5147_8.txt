The first week of May brings back the memory of the Holocaust every year, through films on television. Among many films, they showed that this was what I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilters life and how he came to power. It begins with his childhood and ends with keeping the supreme position of power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a television series and later transformed into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great gut, conviction and flare to give a true portrayal of this man. It is a good manuscript and narrative that educates the audience on the most important events that lead Hitler to power, and also tries to show the likely psychological composition of Hitler. The film is a biased viewpoint for director Christian Duguay ?? Who shows Hitler as a one-track, threatening, angry and shouting person? there had such a strong hold on the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not shown as a person who has charishma and attraction and lacks the movie to convince Hitler's portrayal. <br /> <br /> Although the venture was for television, all the ingredients in the production are first class and on par with any main stream movie. The value, set, costumes, etc. of the production were perfect. <br /> <br /> There is much criticism of this movie, in the authenticity of the historical events being presented. But still, the film is moving, each engaging and entertaining. Robert Carlyle overrides and dominates the screen as no one else does. He is incredibly good ?? brilliant! I would have liked a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think Hitler was able to bring up the Germans' sleeping feelings, and it is not just him who should be blamed for the Holocaust. As I have told several times, it ?? very unfortunately - our society loves to crisis or prosecute a person as a representative of the good or evil of society.
