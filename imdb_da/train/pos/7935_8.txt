Hood of Living Dead had a lot to live up to just before the opening began. First, any game on "the living dead" invokes his Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets a high standard that many movies can't afford to strive for. And secondly, my film actor doubted that any urban horror movie would surpass the usual Leprechaun in the Hood. Skeptical, we committed ourselves to see. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and kindhearted zombie movie. Oh, certainly the budget is low, and of course, the directors' amateurs are popular cast, but Hood of Living Dead loves the zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it's so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a laboratory during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. However, before this planned flight his brother is shot to death in a run. Ricky's eager scientific mind presents an opportunity superior to CPR or 911: Injections of his laboratory's experimental regenerative formula. Unfortunately, small bridge wakes up in an ambulance like a bloodthirsty Oakland zombie! Chaos and chaos! I think it's more economical to eat your enemies than to take revenge on a run, but again I'm a bad judge for the complexity of city life. (How bad a judge? In response to a gory scene involved four men, I opined "Ah-ha! White t-shirts at all so the blood shows up. Economically! I used the same technique in my own low-budget horror movie." Jordan replied, "No, it's a gang dress. White t-shirts were banned from New Orleans bars for a while." Oh, many of the movie is set in a person's living room, so there is a lot of hanging and waiting for the zombies . But the characters are sympathetic and the film is sincere - it surpasses its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Zombie explanation: When playing God, zombies arise! Or maybe: Follow the FDA-approved test rules before human experimentation! <br /> <br /> Contribute to the zombie cannon: This is the first zombie movie I've seen with a shooting shoot. As far as the actual zombies go, infection spreads with a bite as usual, but rather unusual headshots do not work - it is heart shot that kills. Zombies have pulses whose absence shows true death. And these zombies do pretty cool jaguar trench sounds. <br /> <br /> Gratuitous zombie movie in-joke: A mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite Zombie: Jaguar noise little brother zombie, of course!
