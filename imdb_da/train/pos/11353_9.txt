This movie was excellent. It describes the struggle between a committed detective against the corrupt communist regime's dedicated ignorance in Russia during the 80s. I give this movie high marks because it is unblocked to look at the birth and development of forensic examination in a globally isolated (thanks to the "Regime") community. This is a graphic movie. It presents an unseenised image of violence and it is tragic remains. Nothing is "candy-coated" with exaggerated blood or do to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I know enough about the true story of having a very deep understanding of how true they were. It's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this movie is a must-see.
