My friends and I just discussed how frustrated we are with the way film and especially romantic comedy is made. We feel insulted by the schlock that Hollywood is serving up these days as they work as everything is good. Well, everything is not good ... except for a few bright spots, like this movie. It doesn't have the big name actors, the big budget, I don't think it had a great release (I rented from Hollywood Video) it didn't really have anything that most big budget romantic comedies have. <br /> <br /> But most of them lacked. It had great chemistry between the interests of love, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not forced upon us as so many. The director took his time to get these characters to know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The support support not only added really funny comic moments, but also the depth of the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his staff in a mental hotline was very fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how great it feels to fall in love.
