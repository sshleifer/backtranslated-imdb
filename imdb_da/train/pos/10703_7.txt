This movie is definitely a strange love story. Although this movie may not be much to shout about, the Nicole Kidman carries the movie alone, the rest of the casting could easily be forgotten, though Ben Chaplin does a great job with Hertfordshire Life with pictures of St Albans & Hemel Hempstead town center that depicts the area's true essence. What starts out looking like a regular episode of the popular British television series "Heartbeat" soon becomes a gritty gangster getaway action flick. Nothing really unforgettable happens in this simple little movie and thus ends up as a decent weekend entertainment. A good one to see and if you like the hero John is lonely thirty something, you can find something to identify with in his character.
