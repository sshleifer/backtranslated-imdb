Julie Waters is excellent and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very hot, very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications of sex dysphoria and transvestism in a young leader's life. The core of this movie is the true truth that you have to accept yourself before you can hope that others will accept you.
