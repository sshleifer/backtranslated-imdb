[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Being a David Lynch movie, one could have the idea that it portrays the enigmatic mind of his as the majority of his feature films do. But this is a very straightforward story as the title can be suggested. Except to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehension that usually occurs after viewing, ie. Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's actually a good movie. It is both from an innovative and entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and therefore put together a movie that may seem very common and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, he can just make a movie like this just to justify his regular audience because he knows what they expect, but he doesn't give it to them. It would be sad. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow. I would almost say the mower speed ... Don't expect an action orgy, but the movie is really entertaining for those who go with the flow of the movie. Look carefully for the little details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment. Look for the big movie that makes this movie alive. And listen to the Badalamenti's score and main theme that really animates Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes that appear frequently. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this movie, making him one of the most sympathetic ol men ever pictured on film. He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness shines right through him, and his acting gave him an Oscar nomination. Should I say that his weak health in this movie was not acted upon? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot immediately after this film was finished. This knowledge puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above are a very nice movie that fits all kinds of people like a movie they should do. One can ask for homilies that are not so obvious and a little naive, but it does not destroy the overall picture, as it is a memorable movie picture. 10.9.
