Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I think it's not), it really shows the power of Media. The significance of this documentary is not to show how good a man Chavez is. It really is to demonstrate how the Bolivarians saw how it happened, Chavez's way of looking at it. While it may seem wrong and regrettable to support a movie, I believe that the viewpoint of the film is quite legitimate. The Venezuelan people via Venezuela's private media corporation saw only a side view of the coup, the neo-liberal side. This film shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it's a judgment from you.
