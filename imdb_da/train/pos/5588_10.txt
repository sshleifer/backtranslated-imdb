The first time I had the window with the opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980s, in one of our art houses as a revival. When I saw this fever dream of an exercise in the sexuality of the 1930s, I thought YOWZA! They got rid of murder in Europe back in the day. Unfortunately, this movie was heavily cut in the original American release of the blue-nosed Hayes Office (the magnificent government censorship, started by the Bible "sanctified than you", Will Hayes ... a former post office official if you can believe it), due to of the overall theme of human sexuality (the forbidden people of heaven actually had sex in the 1930s). The Ecstasy plot relates to a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man and later regrets it. She (Lamarr) encounters a beautiful young man and has an affair with him, resulting in a divorce from a former man (another no no in Hollywood movie again then --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the director's first time to work in the audio format (ie, the film seems to possess techniques that were mainly used in silent films --- that is, 1920's expressionism). It is still worth searching for a window for early European spoken images along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dryer's 'Vampyre' (1931). Not rated, but containing the infamous naked swim scene and some thin blurred sexual references that would cost slightly more than a PG-13 according to today's standards (but would have easily landed the dreaded 'X' back in the 30s if it existed thereafter )
