I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters, and the plot is not filled with twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But what does this movie have: An interesting study on how families' deal with grief. How when the language of healing and overcoming enormous loss leaves us dumb, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the protagonist (a young boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother during hunting) in the movie is more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), making it clear to him that it was an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but needed to hear these words from his parents and to receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved about this movie: the lack of dialogue. There was a great emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really see the reactions of the actors. Something we can't do much with today's movies. <br /> <br />
