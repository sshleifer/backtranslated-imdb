This is one of the few films released on a "what if" type of situation that made me think. It was great to hear them talk to each other and recall all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them. In fact, I think there is a very good chance that this happened as the movie entails, and they actually made peace with each other. It is good memories for every fan to hang on, and asking what actually happened between them would be selfish. What a fantastic movie this was. The comic aspects of the movie were wonderful. Thinking they were together to clear things up between them in such a way is a comforting thought to people who want them to have a chance to clear the air with someone they didn't get. To see John as such a care, withdrawal character was refreshing from hearing all the waste that was spoken about him ...
