I really loved this movie and so did the audience that I saw in Los Angeles. After the movie many people cried and said how much the movie had affected them. I can see why it was such a big hit in his home country, Sweden. The movie is masterfully directed, and each character is brilliantly drawn, so in the end you really know these people and care about them. The music is very natural and the most important song in the film is quite heartbreaking, but inspiring. Will definitely recommend this movie to anyone to watch - even people who don't normally go to subtitles. Absolutely deserved Oscar Nomination, because the film's deep themes are reflected without pretension in a small urban community with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. One must see!
