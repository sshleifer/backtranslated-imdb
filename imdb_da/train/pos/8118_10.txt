So it was not until 1975 on a German TV channel and was connected immediately, then I watched this movie about 12 times in cinemas, and today I have a videotape that I see at least once a year - this movie is excellent in all aspects (direction, acting, cutting, musical score ...). The sets are excellent and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating World War, starting in the late thirties, seems like a prophecy for a 1936 movie, the dictator of "Everytown" is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is just charming, trustworthy and ideally cast as "hero". The positive tone towards technology and advancement is quite refreshing at today's usually pessimistic standards - especially the finished scene, which always brings a tear or two in the eyes even after I've seen the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on TV but it was made for the big screen so if you have the opportunity to watch it in a movie theater. Please, it's overwhelming.
