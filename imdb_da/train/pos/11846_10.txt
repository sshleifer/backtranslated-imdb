I liked this movie a lot. The animation was well finished and the romance was sweet. I liked most Bryan Adams songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent. What many people do not know is how well it relates to the heart of dark / apocalypse Now themes (what happens when the so-called "civilization" invades another's home, what does it mean to be "civilized", etc.). The opening landscape and the music were very stirring. The film is a regret for an America that was once beautiful.
