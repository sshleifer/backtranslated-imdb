There are 21 comments when I add my to this list and there is hardly any criticism. This is because this movie is great entertainment and has a bit of everything. <br /> <br /> It may be a little scary for younger kids, but my 15-year-old son thought it was great in every way from action, to humor and even to the beautiful music score. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they are regularly watched, and now that this is finally available in the UK, I will definitely add it to my collection.
