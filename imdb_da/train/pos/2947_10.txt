If you haven't seen this, you don't know what you're missing. The first time you do, you will be in pain lying on the floor, throwing away from laughing so hard, and probably even wet yourself. It is fun. There has not been a single comic performance to this date that I have seen tops this or even come close. So many classic one liners, stories and segways .. The drunken uncle on the BBQ, Give Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, the ice cream man, you say some of these things to anyone who has seen this achievement and I bet you dollars for donuts, they will not be able to hold a straight face and will burst into laughter or recite the rest of the dialogue from the action. Pure classic !! Shame you can't get it on DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
