Hi, this little movie is interesting especially for an artist, film producer or music creator or an artist, for: <br /> <br /> You can feel and examine David's touch / style right out of a short piece of relatives simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic distance between shoots, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple movie, this creation is multilayer. For example, there are some sounds that drone all the time while others appear (though subtle), on some points to support certain shots. You can also see several types of pans: some go up and down in a mild return way. There is a diagonal pan. Zooms also go back and forth. <br /> <br /> The lightness and composition / disposition of elements in space is, as usual, and of course, a work of a pain / artist. This can be felt even in this crappy room. This means that you can create exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look and composing the scene. Then comes the forelines of the images: like the digonals, parallels, etc. The degradation of the light and the colors, but without much research on textures as in large productions, are also fine. This is an artist's sketch of some kind ... All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling, and this feeling gives David touch / feels like with any true artist.
