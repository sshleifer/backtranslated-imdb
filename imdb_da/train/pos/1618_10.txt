This movie is brilliant in every way. It affects the complexity of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The manuscript never rejects any character, not even the relentless Johnny. It is also the benefits of spot-on direction, production design, casting and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and is more unlike "Cher" than she has ever been, is a marvel to me. I see Moonstruck at least once a year, and I just saw it again on Christmas Eve with my 16 year old twin daughters, and they loved it too. It has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.
