Perhaps not the absolute greatest entry into the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the prize for the most inventive title episode! "The house that died" ?? I could shout out this title all day without ever getting tired of it! And besides the wonderful title, this short film also helps with a solid play and a handful of genuinely exciting moments. It may require an extra view before fully understanding the peculiar end twist, but it is definitely an original idea for a horror card. The story opens with pictures of an older couple drinking tea in their middle class. The man kills sadistically his wife and several years later the "damned" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and begin to restore it, but mysterious events arise and affect especially young Sophie. Her beloved cat is killed even though her birthday is ruined when one of the house's pipes suddenly splashes blood over the guests (a very chilling sequence, this one!). Is the old house really haunted? Or perhaps the seemingly useful neighbors cause the whole horror? The answers to these questions are in the original and rather unpredictable climax, and there is even room for a real shock at the end. The excitement is masterfully constructed, and the titular house is filled with creepy landscapes like the pair of rusty machetes used by the man to kill his wife. A little warning though, the sequence of the cat is hard to see when you are a wildlife. In conclusion, another winner for Hammer's short-running TV series!
