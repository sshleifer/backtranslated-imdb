So yes it's pretty nostalgic to see the first episode, because this is the only episode I definitely remembered. I enjoy watching the first season and yes to the action-packed shows we now have, this seems to be boring. But frankly, I like the "less violent" part of the show, and history has more substance than the new ones now. I thought it was interesting that Belisario's Airwolf and JAG have similar themes - the main actor (Hawke and Harm) are both seeking an MIA family (brother, father). wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' themes. <br /> <br /> Questions - have any pictures of Hawkes cottage. I love this cabin (a bit like a dream cabin) and that is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
