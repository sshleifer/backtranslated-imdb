Steven Spielberg paused from his escapist in the early 80s and instructed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Purple Purple" on the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching the Goldberg play Celie, it's amazing that this is the same woman who starred in movies as the "Sister Act". This is the kind of movie that could easily be - no, it means that it should be part of the curriculum in black studies and women's studies. There is a scene that can be the most magnificent editing job ever on the screen (you know it when you see it). I can't believe this doesn't win a single Oscar; It may be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (maybe even tied to it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
