This was excellent. Touching, action packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This film is the story of an outdated soldier who learns that there is more to life than soldiers, and people who learn that there is time to fight a need to defend. I cried, laughed and sat mostly in awe of this story. Good writing job for an action girl, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The end was not twisted, but it was still outstanding. If you like to escape from New York or rooting for underdog, this movie is for you. Not an unreasonable amount of doing or violence, it was not hard to see in that respect. Something for everyone.
