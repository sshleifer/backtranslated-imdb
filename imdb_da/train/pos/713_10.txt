This movie is amazing. kind of. The lecturer says a lot, or does a lot, but it is a great movie to watch because of how stupid it is. high school is taken over by evil m.togar, who hates the only thing that all students love, rock & roll. riff randle get all the tickets to the ramones show, and this movie tops with a take over school led my riff randle and ramones. this movie has everything, a bad script, dubious instruction, bad actors (ie clint howard & pj soles), a great soundtrack, extreme campyness, these elements and more come together to do this what it is, a classic. <br /> <br /> Note - during the live ramon set, note that the darby collision of the bacteria is in the front of the audience. on an island.
