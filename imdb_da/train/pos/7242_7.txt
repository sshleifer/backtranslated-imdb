1933 seemed to be a good year for satires (eg Duck Soup) and this fits in well, though it is about contracting with a contract bridge. The tone is, as a humorous piece from The New Yorker, appropriate since the movie begins with the page "Goings On About Town" in that magazine. The only thing that is strange is the molding. Made a few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. But after 1934, you wouldn't have had adultery handled in a sophisticated way, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some shifts and slender outfits or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge competition on the radio. Although you don't know anything about the bridge, you can still check out a rare example of Hollywood satire.
