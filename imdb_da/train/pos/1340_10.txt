This documentary was interesting, but it was also long (as long as it lasts a total of 225 minutes), like Ben-Hur long. But if your into it, it's for you. But only if you have a passion for movies that I do. Being Martin Scorsese, is my favorite instructor (live and maybe even ever), it's quite fascinating, especially if you know the style of Scorsese's works. Because then you can understand where he got inspiration for many of his films. Not the best documentary ever made, but it's a leap to Scorsese, which is always good to see. ONE
