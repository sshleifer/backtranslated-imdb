If you have any kind of appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of American cultural history, you will find very absorbent material in this film. It was probably originally a game, and that is why the dialogue is heavy, but I cannot stress how these icons, which we only have a low concept of, are made into truly complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than any college course to tell you how to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
