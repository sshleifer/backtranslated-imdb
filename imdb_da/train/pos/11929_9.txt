A piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family movie is a business. <br /> <br /> At that time in 1994, this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in movie history (and can continue to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - undoubtedly in honor of the original movie "Angels" that "haunted" Pittsburgh Pirates. In this recreation, they "spins" the Californian angels. <br /> Whatever happened, the premiere was held at the removed Three Rivers Stadium, home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers at that time (Pirates are now located in PNC Park and Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere was held on a movie screen, five stories in height at the stadium and held (and perhaps even continue to hold) the record for the biggest movie premiere in history, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd all attended thousands of sports fans.
