... Oxford, Mississippi, at least. Okay, Paris we get is Paris, Culver City except for the creation of the library footage of the real McCoy, but it is Paris in spirit than as nothing, nowhere is better. Okay, Kelly is not Astaire, but who is there, and Caron is no Hepburn, this one, but Alan Lerner is bright years ahead of the much-overstated Comden and Green, who wrote Kelly's other 'big' 50s musical Singin 'In The Rain (a curious replication of lyricists writes screenshots of songs by other poets and just to balance things, the Gershwin numbers are far superior to the Arthur Freed / Nacio Herb Brown numbers, so Alan Lerner did not have to feel pre-classified. The story doesn't have to hold us back more than the irregularities -Kelly hasn't changed a fight and is a painter, that is, bohemian, but he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit in a few hours when Foch invites him to dinner at her hotel; in the well-documented love is here to stay in order, the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers-by, other lovers and the bridge in the background is completely free of both pedestrian and vehicle traffic - it is an emotional musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case, it stands four square. Which feels good musicals is definitely in the top 10.
