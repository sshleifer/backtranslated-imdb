The movie is okay, it has the moment the music scenes are best of all! The sound track is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (appropriate for the start as it's a big party song and very up-tempo), Take me with you (a fun pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a cheerful ballad , probably the closest thing to R&B on this entire album), Computer Blue (a somewhat angry anthem against Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, it makes it very vague by Appolonia), when Doves Cry (Climax for this masterpiece), I would die 4 u, I'm a star, and of course purple rain (a true classic, a really good ending to this classic album) movies and albums are both very good. I highly recommend them!
