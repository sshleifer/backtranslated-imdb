"The Ladies Man" suffers from a common problem among movies based on "Saturday Night Live" sketches. And that means that a sketch that normally succeeds in five minutes does not go as well in ninety minutes. Although this movie has its laughs, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a sex lunatic right out of the 70s, and Will Ferrell as a wrestling man who was thrown by Leon. So this movie is fun enough, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
