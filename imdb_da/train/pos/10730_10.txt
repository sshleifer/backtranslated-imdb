Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at the same time as Challenger Explosion. That really puts a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should, bring it out. I'm glad they did. I first saw SpaceCamp on a drive-in movie. That really improved the view a lot. <br /> <br /> While I had heard of Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of the others in the movie. So it came as a big shock to me to find all the young people who acted and worked really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes where these kids were shown how to act as a team. The scenes on the children are prepared for a trip they could only hope for. Of course, the actual launch of a spacecraft is old news to us. But one was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most beloved movies. Escapist maybe, but it was great for a room like me. After enough to rent it for 30 - 40 times. I finally found it available in a particular store and bought it. Now, if it only comes out on DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
