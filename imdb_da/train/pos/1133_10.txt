This is a nice movie that is so over-top that my wife, daughter and I found it irresistible. The reason is just crazy, but "ringing true" to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous inaccuracies and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed Kevin Kline and Sally Fields performances. I can't help anyone better than Kline by playing THICKheaded. Field's character is really desperately in need of attention and affirmation - and her almost bipolar mood swings - played nicely on the back of Field's famous (infamous?) "You Like Me!" Oscar exclaim. People who can take care of such large grains of salt are far too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think it's the only movie I didn't find impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization; I thought she was "spot on" in every note she hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also top class. Just a great movie if you are in the mood to go together for the ride and LAV!
