The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got Osiric's comedy role, or it might be a little strange to see him in such a production. It is really good that Kenneth decided to use the full version of the text, it certainly does not happen too often ... Thanks to that, viewers can see the whole, not the chosen one - of the director's parts. Also - thank God that the movie is in classic form; NO to surreal fanfaberies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive anyway, but Hamlet is still another story, it is certainly my point of view.
