Yeah ... I go with 1-0 on this and here's why. For the past few years, I've seen a couple of comedies and only left with a few gentle laughs and a few video rental fees because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I stumble upon "Nothing". So interesting, didn't expect much though. I was mistaken. This was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the opportunity to see. Dave and Andrew make a good comic couple and humor was captivating enough to remember but not too complicated to the point where you lacked joke. I don't want to notice any of the actual scenes because I feel this is a movie worth watching for a while. With more and more senseless concepts coming in movies (you know like killed military rays and "fresh" remakes that destroy ancient classics), this movie will make you happy to say it's OK to laugh at "Nothing".
