I just watched "Valentine" and I have to say it was the best slasher movie I've seen this year. Contrary to the recent trend of the 90's horror flicks, this movie is more worried about being scary than it is to be self-supporting. For those who hated "Scream", there is no reference to the "horror rules" in this movie (although the old slasher movie rules apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect blend of the horror of the 80s and 90s. You get the style, filmography and good plays of the 90s movie and stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick. I assume that the year 2001 will finally give horror fans the kind of movies they longed for. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out as a fun character. You can tell that she liked her role and it makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
