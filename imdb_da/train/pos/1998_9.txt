In Cinema Retro Magazine # 2, it has been revealed that Mark Lester's voice was actually named by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all happy with his songwriter. The secret was revealed by a 2004 British documentary entitled "Oliver! After They Were Famous". Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and she had to accept to keep her participation secret, like Mark Lester. They kept their words and revealed only this fact as part of the TV show decades after the release of the movie. For the post, Mark Lester went back from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
