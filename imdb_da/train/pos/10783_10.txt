I enjoyed this movie. Have not seen Andy Griffith for years and felt he was perfectly suited to this role. I've linked him with comedy, but I'm happy to see that he's versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" might not have been the order of a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of whatever phobias and neuroses, and these can display a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive to extra-sensory forces that the local Indians understood, but not to any Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although this is taken to be a light "family movie", it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also, Hiram's twist came to the end as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the previous actions together in a bundle. It is fun to consider the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
