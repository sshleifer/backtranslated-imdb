A guy desperate for action trying to hit a beautiful girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs for someone who tries to steal her bag, they still come together. And there it begins - a relationship that is slightly contaminated by being a jealous and neurotic superhero. It cannot be a secret that things between them become problematic. In short, a story that could promise to grow into a cool movie. And IMO succeeds in being a good movie. It is not a masterpiece, but it had me in tears laughing more than an occasion - the two main characters spin about each other in a crazy loving party that is, even though superhero things are credible. <br /> <br /> So. Thin story, but prepared really fun and thus worthy of cinema time. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
