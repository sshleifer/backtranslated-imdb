I felt this movie - all the way through. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, such a typical Aussie blend of soft soft approach, a little self-intimidating, and very persistent. Really beloved movie and direction. The pace was just right, and the images from almost all characters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh, Russell's talent wasn't already in 1993! .. and I do not yet see gladiator.
