A number of factors make it easy for me to state that I still believe this is the most important science fiction movie ever made, despite some of the acting, outdated dialogue, etc. First there is the scale of imagination by describing Krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than Earth's humans (us) and their technology, especially the 8,000 cubic mile machine. <br /> <br /> Second, there are music and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. It creates a creepy, eerie feeling, as opposed to "2001" which had traditional classical music. <br /> <br /> Third, its "monster" is not only the most powerful and mortal ever foreseen, it is also based on real science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. Finally, and most importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and unbelievably manages to make an honest, intelligent and merciless logical statement on the boundaries or ceiling of human development (or any other biological entity) , no matter how long we survive as a species. In other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.
