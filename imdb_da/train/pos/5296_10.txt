Absolutely fun. John Waters tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little little with lots to look at and laugh at. It's like being knocked out in a kitsch kit! I haven't laughed so much in a theater since serial. I loved seeing old friends from Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' camera. Cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Uses the best elements of earlier Waters atrocities (especially the underrated Polyester) and lots of new surprises. Make me sick, in a wonderful way. Thank you
