SPOILERS USED FOR PREPARATION. <br /> <br /> Twenty years since 1984, this film speaks of Prince's future in the music industry. There is a scene that sums up Prince's musical output from the last 10 years perfectly, which is if you took the best two songs from his last 10 albums, you would have a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays like this. Prince runs out to his dressing room after playing a song, and the owner's owner enters the locker room to give Prince an earpluck about his fall from the grace of the 90s and release albums that only the most hardcore fans could tolerate and support his artistry. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You don't pack them as you used to. The only person digging your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! What about the musical underlining that makes Prince even more painful when he tastes Apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me chills that it was not the only scene women mistreated in this movie. I'm too comedy sparring between Morris Day and Jerome Benton when these two stole every scene they were in. But what was fun throwing a woman in a bin? It was clearly ugly! The other unpleasant bit was the lime plan of the prince's father on the floor who was gently delivered by the Minnieapolis police, which made Prince go even more luney !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining movie in general, as it is the soundtrack of Prince songs that increases that value by 110%. But then again the film gives us another theory of prince and his music, when the film tells us that the prince's greatest song of the film is written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes wife, who beats musical father! <br /> <br /> Is your prince and filmmaker trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets with written songs? Maybe that's why Prince began to run out of steam in the 90s because he ran out of his father's ideas ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
