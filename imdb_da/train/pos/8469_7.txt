I generally love these 1930s mystery / police Charlie Chan type movies, and that's no exception. But something does not work well with this movie. A delayed attempt to switch from cerebral Moto movies centered around the plot's contrivances to a salad bar spoiled by comedy relief relief relief like sore feet. A typecast buffoon emerges from nowhere that publishes a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters appear to be intricate in providing comedy help. The reason may seem strange or just an excuse for us today, but then the possibility of epocal archaeological discoveries was not only genuine but a common occurrence.
