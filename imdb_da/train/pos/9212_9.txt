Yesterday I went alone to the cinema, because here in Mexico, films from other countries are in most cases part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternative" (alternatively camera). But after I watched this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I've had so much this movie .. that at the end I was happy .. this movie is a little bit of hope these days. And the most important lesson for me is the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a great opportunity to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention the good music ... especially the movie's main song .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song! !!
