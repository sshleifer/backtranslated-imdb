The 74th oscars were a very good one. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very fun and desire. I personally loved her last feel, which gave some free reviews due to rough language and fun jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier made this an Oscar's telecast to remember. <br /> <br />
