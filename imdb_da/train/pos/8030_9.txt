This was another great Tom Berenger movie .. But some people are right, it was like another SGT CHILDREN'S character, but it was still awsome .. Tom Berenger played a big sniper in Panama's jungles! Billy Zane was a wuss at first like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but then he became a little more aggressive at last! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it .. I remind you that it wouldn't have as much action as a reg action flick .. I also have this on DVD and it's excellent!
