The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn a crime that makes a long sentence that breaks free from a chain band. He and his friends go to the Mexican border from prison and security. No, they don't, because Coburn has revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and killing his wife. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, now retired, and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was housed in a cabin and involved in a Waco as a stop. His Indian woman was killed in shots of shots shot. It's not something he is proud of, she was a security accident in a manhunt. <br /> <br /> Let's be sorry Coburn, he lets us know what an evil man he really is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the play in The Last Hard Men goes to James Coburn. He blows everyone else out of the screen when he is on. <br /> <br /> Coburn gets the bright idea to make sure Heston tracks him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston should do it personally then. <br /> <br /> Coburn's gangs include Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum with whom his son-in-law is. <br /> <br /> The last hard men are a nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen instructed it, and I think it could have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows much of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to highlight the violence. There are many of them. <br /> <br /> For a little Peckin Paugh, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
