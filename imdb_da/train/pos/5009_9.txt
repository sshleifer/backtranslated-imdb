As the first of the television offers offered on the elaborate box series, "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials" released last November, this disc is released separately for those who don't want to fork over dollars for everyone five specials. As an investment, this is actually the best of the pile if only because Streisand is her cleanest and most eager to impress. Being so brilliant is an important part of her legend. Signed for a long-term contract with CBS to produce hour-long exhibitions, an almost extinct format today, Streisand was all 22 in this CBS special first broadcast in April 1965. At the time of her career, her infidelity was limited to a handful of best-selling albums, a couple of dazzling TV shows on black and talk shows and her successful Broadway run in "Funny Girl". <br /> <br /> The sharp black and white film, the program is divided into three different parts. With the creative transitional use of "I'm Late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland", the first segment shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". Opening with a comic monologue on Pearl from Istanbul, the second part moves on the spot to Manhattan's chic Bergdorf Goodman, where she elegantly costs herself in a series of glamorous clothes while singing Depression-era songs like "I've got lots of Nuthin" and "The best things in life are free" with comic irony. Back to the basics, the third segment is a straight-ahead concert that opens with a torch version of "When the Sun Comes Out", features a "Funny Girl" medley and ends with its classic, melancholy recording "Happy Days Are Here Again" over the final credits. Also included is the short introduction she taped in 1986 when the thesis was first published on VHS. For those who only know Streisand for her expensive concert tickets and political fundraising, this is a real eye-opener in why she is so venerable now.
