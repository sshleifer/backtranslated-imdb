Delightful Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in good shape as a medievalist whose interest turns into witchcraft in World War II England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the movie, and she's just ideal for that. She is Jessica Fletcher again, but this time it benefits or children and for Mother England in a time of great danger. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the story of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor of witchcraft in trying to get some information about witchcraft. The 3 little darlings sent live with Price to escape the London bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting movie for all of us, regardless of age. Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe have so little to do in this imaginative movie. I was really thinking of the Ben Stiller movie "Night at the Museum" at the end of the movie, when the relics come to life to battle with the Nazi invasion of the little British coastal city.
