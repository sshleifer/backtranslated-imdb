Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac effortlessly explores the world of extremes with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is a deteriorating writer, killer, and addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and madness. Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck, Harry begins his killing. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins, part 1 of the wildest story will ever be filmed. The only other movie I've seen is similar to this would happen as the 2nd installment titled Schizophreniac Necromaniac <br /> <br /> This is a really low budget movie and won't be for everyone but if you're looking for something disruptive, different and horrible, so this will be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DON'T EXPECT WHEN MODERN DAY HORROR (Like Scream) <br /> <br /> Viewer's discretion is recommended
