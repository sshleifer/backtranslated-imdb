When I see most reviews, it's called 'a misfire for Eddie Murphy'. These critics will look at some of the things he is doing these days, and maybe soften their attitude in retrospect. "The Golden Child" is not high entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breathes new life into old clich√©s, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand the overwhelming lack of 'love' for its efforts at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the company was tired of knockabout, excitement-one-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; It is unfair to make this a scapegoat when it is perhaps its greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing that is necessarily wrong with trying to exploit trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, but even an occasional observer must understand that "ridiculous" is where Hollywood's mysterious idea begins and ends. What is more important than credibility with a story like this is that the audience has entertaining tour guides at hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill well for this capacity. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the tour.
