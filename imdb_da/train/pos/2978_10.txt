BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is an off-the-wall movie featuring star players, South Park Creator Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway that becomes a national sensation. Most gags are really fun, but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opponents. There is no rule on what is not allowed, so of course they make the craziest things possible. An error in this movie is that the pace is too fast, and after looking for about half an hour, I found myself asking "Wow this this over already?" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug are constantly harassing Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a comic classic with some very quoted lines, and it's very fun to watch!
