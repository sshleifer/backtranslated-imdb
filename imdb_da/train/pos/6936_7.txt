Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics to bring back the Western after World War II. Director Anthony Mann will get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their two evil characters involved in a high stakes poker game with the beloved Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories at the same time. Look for Rock Hudson's first appearance as Young Bull. God God, with in a few years we will begin to let Indians play themselves in Western movies. The movie is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I wouldn't put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but it does get an above-average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
