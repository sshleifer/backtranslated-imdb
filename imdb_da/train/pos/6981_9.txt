To all those hating out there: Condemning a television series with an episode is like judging a whole book after reading the first few pages. That said, I was a big fan of BSG, thought it was some of the best TV drama (not just sci-fi) on the air. But it was time to end and the story continued. I liked the BSG epilogue "The Plan" but it raised so many new questions as it replied, so I eagerly expected "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. I was hoping it would not be another BSG and I was happy that "Caprica" ​​is something different and I personally found the story interesting in a different way from the fiery spaceflash, explosions and sci-fi special effects (not wrong, I also like those things). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was just amazing. I can't wait until next week.
