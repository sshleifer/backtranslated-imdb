The groundbreaking Technicolor Cinematography (Winner of Special Technical Achievement Oscar) is truly enchanting. Add an endless array of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you have a pretty comfortable "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the well-grounded plot and overblown action seem a lot to be desired. Yet there have been no more breathtaking Technicolor movies before this (1936), and very few since then that can enhance this amazing visual experience of stunning colors. Biographies, who have had the wonderful color math in "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939), will not be disappointed with the amazing work done here. "The Garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color kinematics.
