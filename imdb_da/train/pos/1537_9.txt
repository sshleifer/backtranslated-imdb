The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here, Mia visits her parents for the father's birthday, one who occasionally always has some kind of tragedy, the question is just what it will be this year, and you will be surprised ... It is an extremely well composed movie with a story that has a perfect balance between humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You are happy, you get hurt, and basically everything in between. Finally, you can't help falling in love with Mia (if you're a boy I assume (the greatest actress)) She is an extremely well-chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
