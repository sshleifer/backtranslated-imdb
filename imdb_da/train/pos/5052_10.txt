This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian, who grew up with a rural lifestyle, it is very well known, winter, canoeing, catching, hunting and the like. It is easy to take the familiar for granted, but after watching this movie a few times it has grown on me. The story of Gray Owl is known for many Canadians' credit to director Attenborough and scriptwriter Nicholson to extend the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan does well with a complex man, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is lovely in her first big role. The rest of the casting is fixed.
