This is the only movie I've seen Prince in, but it doesn't matter. And I thought he was only good at singing a boy, I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is amazing. That's why it won Oscar in 1984 for the best music for a movie (or such). Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under his belt. Although the curse gets in the way of the movie (just make sure no young children or the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You really need to go out and get this movie, your collection is not complete unless you have this movie in it. What else could I say except to go get this movie now!
