This movie was released by Roger Corman so you know the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with. Although some viewers may miss the subtleties of this movie because of the very typical "obsessed with unique differences in this movie. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, played by the obviously talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character. People like these movies just because violence can seem random, but here is the form of past abuse (treated in a realistic but tasteful way), which forms AMANDA's psychosis. Surprisingly, Amanda finally redeems with a love art where most of these movies become the typical, all-out battle against death, and the evil character dies just as bad in the end as in the beginning. <br /> <br/> Some rough edges in this picture, but I'll give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thought-provoking and yes originality compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
