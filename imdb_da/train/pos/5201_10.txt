The Human Tornado is a campy 70's Blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedy Rudy Ray Moore in perhaps his most endless role to date. The movie tells the story of Dolemite, a bad ass pimpin hustler, coming on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife. The Dolemite almost escapes and travels to sunny California to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and wife of Dolemite's "ladies") called Queen Bee. However, it seems that a rival nightclubs with mob connections are trying to muscles on her racket so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore shows many different talents in this landmark film, including strong dramatic abilities, a mastery of Kung Fu, an impressive song voice (he gives two songs on the soundtrack), a touching, compassionate side of the ladies, and an overall convincing charisma and keen sense comic timing. This movie has it all, people: A deep plot, blistering action, ridiculous my comedy, beautiful women in need, a slam-bang ending ... What more can you ask from a movie?
