The best part of an American in Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end, where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several great painters. Kelly has previously been established as a porter in Paris, so the sequence is the logical end to a musical blast with life and energy, Gershwin melodies and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was the best here - it's a little different to Singin 'in the rain, and the effect of the whole movie as a topped with the ballet gives it a clear wow factor. No wonder the sequence ended 'That's Entertainment' after all other MGM musical highlights had gone!
