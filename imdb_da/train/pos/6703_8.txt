My kids recently started seeing reruns of this show - both the early episodes of N and those later on ABC Family - and they love it. (I didn't realize that the performance was even past the first or second season). I am curious about what was asked for all the thrown changes - I have seen them described as "high published" and another half an hour of searching the web has revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes. (Personally, I don't see a lot of difference - the scriptures and themes remain pretty much the same all the time - but they lose some good people along the way) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the country of special features and comments will shed light over all this. I also wish they had made self-meaning humor about the changes - as if "Boy Meets World" where they release the sister site for a whole season or so, and when another actor later turns out to play her, she asks her where she has been and she says "upstairs" or when the early series of token-geek "Minkus" turns out to high school, they ask him where he has been and he says "over there" pointing to that part of the classroom never shown by the camera before you say "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and running off screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left) Oh well - maybe there will be an E true Hollywood story about this or something? I was just happy to see Aunt Hilda show up to the finals - she was always one of my favorites - it was wrong it couldn't have been a more comprehensive cast reunion. (Zelda candle does not cut it for me)
