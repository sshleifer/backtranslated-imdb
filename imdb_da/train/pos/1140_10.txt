I've been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because Teri Hatchers moves into the foreground, I had to take the film from the shelf and see it. Why did people back in 1991 not see how wonderful this movie was beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are amazingly amazing. Although I have never seen in daytime, this movie turns me every time I see it. The action is something else for a comedy, and the writing is so smart. I strongly recommend that you see this if you don't already have it. You get to see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... all give amazing performances.
