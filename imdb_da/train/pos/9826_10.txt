This low budget erotic thriller has some good points but much more bad. The reason is about a female lawyer trying to clear her girlfriend who is accused of murdering her wife. Being a soft-core movie means that she goes undercover at a strip club and has sex with possible suspects. As plots go to this type of genre, not too bad. The script is okay, and the story gives enough meaning to a person at 2 o'clock at this time, not to see too many plot holes. But everything else in the film seems cheap. The main players are not that bad, but virtually all the supportive are incredibly bad (a girl seems like she is full and / or tall). The camera is brightly lit, with everything looked and ugly. The sound is so awful that you can hardly hear what people are saying. The worst thing about this movie is why you see it - sexy. The reason why people look at these things is for hot sex scenes with real hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes are not hot, they are relaxed, shot in the porn style, where everything is just a headshot of two people going on it. The woman also looks as if they are refugees from a pornographic shoot. I'm not trying to be rude or mean here, but they all have the breast implants and a burnt out / weathered look. Even the title "Deviant Obsession" sounds like a hardcore flick. Not that I don't mind porn - I actually love it. But I want my soft core and my core separated. What happened to actors like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could trade and who would totally wake you up? And what happened to erotic thrillers like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Sure, none of these were masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. Plus, they push the envelope that goes beyond Hollywood's relatively cautious attitude to sex, sexual obsessions, and perversions. Now they just make hard-core movies without the hard core.
