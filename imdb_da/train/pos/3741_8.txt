War drama taking place in Louisiana in 1971. It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland - a precise depiction of Vietnam on American soil before they are sent over. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends, and deal with a bad squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a borderline psycho (Shea Wingham). <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera for most of the movie and uses digital video for battle scenes. It seems very good - the film looks laughable (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers its Irish brogue and adopts a rather convincing southern accent. His performance is just amazing - he's a very talented young man. Unfortunately, Davis is not that good. He is tall, muscular, very nice - and very bland. The rest of the throw is just amazing. <br /> <br /> This movie was thrown away by its study. It had no stars in it, a familar story and was considered "just another war movie". It only played a week in Boston! It's worth catching on video or DVD. Farrell and Davis also have a long nude scene.
