When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday life, and it is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic perspective. <br /> <br /> When you know both the Turkish language and either the Danes or the German language, you must watch the movie in any case. Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, synchronized to German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, subtitle in Danish or German respectively. When I looked at it in Mannheim, Germany, the Turkish speaker's reaction showed that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which horribly escaped me, and was only incompletely reproduced in the subtitles. The film is still interesting, even if you lack Turkish knowledge. <br /> <br /> The movie plays a lot on the theme of speed and slowness. At first glance, there is plenty of bodily movement quick as lightning, making it a quick, agitated film. Especially, though this is a Kung Fu movie, beware of the running scenes that beautifully express a wealth of emotions. But there are also a few very slow, emotionally intense scenes too. And above all, the characters develop very slowly than you would expect in a drama of the coming age; There is still a movement in the characters: Look closely to the villain Omar, whose role and acting I liked a lot. <br /> <br /> Contrast of speed and silence nicely contributes to the depiction of human anger and dignity - displayed simultaneously with the same sign at the same time.
