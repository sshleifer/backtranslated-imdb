Writing something real and true is challenging. Knowing how to shoot it and put it together without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's movie is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I have been touched by "The Big Bad Swim" and from now on I will promote it as far as I can. It's just a shame that I can't get something to show to my friends (you know, for example, a DVD ???) because talking is good ... but giving something is better. Everyone can't go to festivals to discover gems like that and this movie is really worth getting out there! A big THANK YOU to the staff of this masterpiece and I am waiting for it to be distributed.
