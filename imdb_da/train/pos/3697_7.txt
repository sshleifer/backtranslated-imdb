I caught this movie on the Sundance Channel on a late afternoon cable. You might say "Who loves the sun" is a perfect casual pastime of a story why not. You are going to hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (returning after abruptly leaving many years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn she is very much part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (is he friend or enemy or fiance), at the scenic Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions equated to lively summer colors against sunshine and shadows. And supporting the trio are two other family members in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is mother Mary Bloom, and R. Thomson is father Arthur Bloom. Writer director Matt Bissonnette has delivered a brilliant unfolding of the story line and its various tentacles - don't worry, Haas may have a "noisy" face, but humor comes as Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends reunited, wry smile will break and know goodies touch. The dialogues can be bitch or even zero, but we will get the taste of what is cooking, confused or wondering. Yes, "Who loves the sun" may well be categorized as a sleeping gem. The chemistry between all five protagonists ensures gels and "burns", giving an energetic ensemble performance. After all, it is in the family, and the film is not really serious. <br /> <br /> It looks like the official site is still available on "wholovesthesun.com" and there is information about the soundtrack of Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar tunes and strings) where scored excerpts are played and behind scenes production notes , interview with author-director producer Bissonnette on how the film and concept came to, casting and more. Has always appreciated Molly Parker since her extra, still hanging performance in 1996 Lynne Stopkewich's 'Kissed', and she's married to Bissonnette, who "wrote the Maggie part to Molly."
