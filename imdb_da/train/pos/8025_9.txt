I love this movie. The songs and story lines are fun. and the song "says goodbye" always moves me. What a brilliant thing to do to bring dolls to life, in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever. great voices and great talent. Why were all the other muppet films that came after this so much less interesting, moving and funny? Is that the Mr. Mr. henson is just so much missed?
