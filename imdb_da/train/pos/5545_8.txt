**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a horror movie fan for many decades now. When I think I've seen all the big ones, someone else comes to surprise me. I had never seen this movie before. It was a treat also outside the beaten path ... not just the road to the swamp boat either. Here was a horror movie made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. The beautiful girl is horrible for a change and saves the men, including the man she loves, from the monster! How's that for a twist. This girl was the complete opposite of most women in film at that time, without screaming in her own shadow, no fainting from scare, no tripping over a leaf as she runs. This gal was not afraid to live alone in a secluded cabin far away from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a foggy swamp that was smoked to be haunted. Heck, she even takes tips on the marsh grass outdoors ... like a regular 1940 version of Ripley. No snake, streets or ghost strings would disturb this gal. Books on early feminist films should help to include this overlooked work. See this if you are a fan of the wonderfully atmospheric classic B / W horror movies they only made in their 30s and 40s. And be sure to wear your cast iron turtle for protection.
