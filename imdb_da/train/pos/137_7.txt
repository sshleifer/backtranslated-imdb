After some of the negative reviews I heard about this movie, I was doubtful about giving it a try, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my purse and thought id gamble on buying a budget movie and saw this and gave it since and i'm glad i did, i enjoyed it. Directed by the star's films such as Chain Reaction, Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox), I had to gamble with this even though it was bad, but it was nothing at all, I found something of humor quite funny, especially the Alfred Molina star in Spider -Man 2 Character Doc Ock. He was excellent the most comfortable part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name and it made me get it! and no his part is not big at all, it's very short at the end of the movie, it's not a big part that makes me believe why people hate the movie. I suggest you give it a ride. Some parts are a pit bad, polishing, acting and a little more action required. But it can be seen.
