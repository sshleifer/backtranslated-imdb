Comment? Like my comment is necessary? We are constantly talking about masterpiece, for all seasons and all generations. This is just the type of movie I still have patience to watch. In this, like in other Disney's movies, some kind of magic is. All characters are somehow "living" and "right", so it's easy to understand the message, even if you don't understand the language (which I didn't understand when I first watched movies because I was about six years old). Maybe my English is not that good, but I learned what I know most about this kind of movie, and it is another great dimension of this kind of movie that is currently rare. But there is a great shame. In my country it is now impossible to see this or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movie. So we will see this movie again "Once upon a dream" or ...?
