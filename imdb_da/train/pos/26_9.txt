When I was a kid, I saw it many times, and I remember flirting the "Happy Cat" song quite often. All the songs are large and indeed memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs just stuck without any real reason. The scenes and costumes are lavish, and the play is very well done, which is not surprising considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very catlike and does not need stupid makeup or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he is a cat that has been transformed into a human being. And Jason Connery is as sweet as the shy and awkward mill's son Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and bold princess Vera. This is a really fun, fun, feature-length movie where, unlike most adventures, the characters are given personalities. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss does Corin as if he's drowning; on the ball when everyone begins to dance a country dance, as it is "the whole rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dances on the table (he is also a lovely dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she used to do when she was young, like pretending to be a daughter of a mill child. I would recommend this movie to both children and parents who love magic and adventure. And it's actually a movie you can see together, as it doesn't drive adults up the wall.
