One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. And the next day we were in the supermarket on Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who came against us in the hallway! Barney Phillips, but no hatred - at least I don't think he was wearing a hat. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye, and he said something like he left it at home and everyone he met that day had asked him to do so. <br /> <br /> A friendly guy. We used to see all kinds of actors in LA these days. I was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the "three hands" of the second alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood Natives and Residents 1947 to 1963.
