First, it was a BRAVE movie. I've seen irreversible and can understand the comparisons. However, I cannot begin to understand the people who have destroyed this movie. I can see how the end might have been extreme, but I would lie if I didn't say I wanted any guy who ever forced a woman to sex, deserved exactly what Jared got. Conversely, it didn't solve anything or did anything better, and the fact that the film doesn't pretend is what made me appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The comment ahead of this called the movie pathetic and claimed no adult would stick to it. I made certain and cautious. I am 24 years old. The way the film draws made it realistic to me. People have become so accustomed to seeing sweets and fast pace on the screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on a brick in the foundation of a movie, not only lose the interest they break down what is built and call it rubbish. In reality, their lack of patience and understanding requires fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind like Talia Lugacy's. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson showed the numbness of self-destruction flawlessly. I think she portrayed Maya before and leaves attacks with great ease, and the transition between the two is an action I rarely ever look good. Often, like the films "targeting teenagers" mentioned in the previous comment, the effects of rape are either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, manages to carry out the Balancing Act, so many survivors fall into prey to: drone-like existence in the waking hours, working some dead-time jobs to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in loads to lose in the mist of drug abuse rather than to what innovation brings. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie told the truth, and I appreciated it to finally show people another side of rape. So many people let the end of this movie devour the middle and the beginning ... I think Maya's face during the action was the end ... not the act ... not the revenge or the meaning behind it ... just her face ... <br /> <br /> Thanks
