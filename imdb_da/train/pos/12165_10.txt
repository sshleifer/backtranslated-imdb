Frownland is one of the no embarrassing situations where you end up laughing at exactly the wrong time; and just as soon as you realize that you should not laugh, you have already reached the pinnacle of voices; And as you look around in the ghostly white faces with their open and open mouth and glassy eyes, you feel a piercing ache that begins in your stomach's pit and suddenly hurts your throat and ... well, you get that point. <br /> <br /> But for all his discomfort and shocks in the face, Frownland, it really is a remarkable piece of work that, after seeing the eerie mess on the protagonist and all his pathetic problems and mishaps, you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly upset by him. <br /> <br /> It would have been much easier for me to just go out of Ronald Bronstein's movie, but for some crazy reason I felt an unwavering determination to keep the course and experience all the grainy annoyance the movie has to offer. If someone puts you on fire, you will typically put it off: Stop! Drop! And Roll! But with this movie, you will see the flame slowly engulf your entire body. You endure the pain - perhaps unbelievable or an unknown masochistic curiosity, I can't even begin to try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the mainstream cinema will never allow this movie to come to a theater near you. But if you get the chance to catch it, prepare yourself: Take a dog bag.
