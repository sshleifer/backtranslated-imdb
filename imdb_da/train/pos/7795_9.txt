This will be another form of notification. I watched this movie twice on television and would like a copy because it tells about Panama City and the beach in winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I had seen by Ashley Judd and she was great, and I have enjoyed all the other things I have seen her in. written several films about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I haven't seen anything to compare it to. The reason speaks less to me than the surroundings. Well, I told you it would be another kind of review.
