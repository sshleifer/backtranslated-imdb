The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's fluttering spirits is probably just for enjoying this movie, but wait! There is more! This is a crackling good sending of daytime TV, movie stars going down, (and up) and the atrocities of love. Robert Downey Jr. shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is great. The dialogue is witty, and the physical humor is finished with complete skill. This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the art of acting, managing and writing.
