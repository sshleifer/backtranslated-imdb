The Odd Couple is a cartoon. A funniest script ever committed to celluloid - exceeded only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: Obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the start of the film, and after an interrupted suicide attempt, he enters into the poker comrade Oscar. Thats when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The whole script is brilliant and full of brilliant one-liners. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke, but it still works great because of Matthaus's comic timing. My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus at dinner and when the pigeon sisters are charmed by a very suave Matthau and Lemmon out of their element. This requires repeated views!
