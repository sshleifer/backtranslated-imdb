This fantastic Oscar winner (4 in total) and John Ford's first Academy Award winner is simply spellbinding with a pounding score of Max Steiner. Called an art movie because Ford had very little money to make this amazing story of guilt and retribution, and greed and stupidity. But what makes this movie a classic is the direction and astonishing photography and use of fog and lighting so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And Oscar's winning performance of Victor McLaglen as the drunk Gypo is simply incredible. Basically, the film is in Ireland, and Gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to English to collect 20 pounds to give his girlfriend. But with all that money, he begins to blow it all night full and give it away while the movement's leaders are trying to track the informant. The whole movie is a night in a dark and misty Ireland, and a cast of characters that are memorable, but all the time the whole world of Gypo closes on him, both psychologically. If I were to choose three leaders to have ALL their films on a desert island forever, and no one else, John Ford would surely be one of them. What a really remarkable movie ...
