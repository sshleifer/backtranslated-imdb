I enjoyed more and more crazy more than any movie I've seen this year. A successful band from the 70s decides to give it another try. They start playing some concerts in some seedy European venues with hilarious results. The music is amazing, the manuscript and the play are amazing. The characters are spot on, especially leading songs with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go see it, preferably in a movie theater with a good sound system :)
