Like most other reviewers, I first saw this movie (on TV, never on the big screen) when I was a teenager. My father has always watched this movie highly and recommended it to me so, and I have to say that he was not only right, but this movie has been with me forever for more than 2 decades since I first saw it. I've seen it two or three times since then (a few days ago I gave it another clock), and it hasn't lost any of its effect over time. It's still a good and worth watching movies! Man considers Peckinpa's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later Westerners who had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the almost unknown LAST HUNT is definitely the best movie and was even half a dozen years earlier . In fact, it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time, or maybe it's still ... Although I think hard and probably have seen the 100s of the Western (I like this genre), I can't remember any Western as gloomy and depressive like this. Two men tied together, partly by hatred, partly by not having other choices, surrounded by beautiful wife Padget, a crooked old man and a young inian who leads the buffalo's life until fate reaches one of them. <br /> <br /> No one who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget about its end and the last frame of this gem. When the camera moves and away from Mr Taylor, a white buffalo skin (on a tree) and echoes of the past, when all hatred began, are present again. Mr. Taylor has his buffalo, but eventually got buffalo. <br /> <br /> Apart from the best performances of all involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned that THE LAST HUNT is terrifically photographed, I have rarely seen a western good shot from those who is directed by Anthony Mann, who is also all excellently photographed), that all places are well-chosen and that even the soundtrack fits well with the picture. <br /> <br /> And BROOKS instructor is really a great storyteller. Master crafts! He has made a couple of really good movies and was successful in almost every genre imaginable, but even in such a great career like this, the last one still shines as one of his best if not his best. br /> <br /> Absolutely deserving a higher rating, compared to the 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY enjoys.
