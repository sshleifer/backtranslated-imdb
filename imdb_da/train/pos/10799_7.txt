Oh, the 1970s. A time when it was to be a swinger. To be honest, it is also a good time to be a swinger, but it just felt more daring then. Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft core movie. Actually, like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors, and these films had a plot and character development. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what you'd expect from a swinger's movie. Two couples with open relationships turn on the transformation of MILF from one of the women who have come to visit. Not much more to it. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles, it's another story. Not too many 40-somethings look as delicious as Mrs Welles. It's worth the price alone to see Ms Welles looking at herself in the mirror as if she were aphrodite. She's not "Stifler's Mom". She's the more sexy. <br /> <br /> I also dig Chris Jordanas Anna. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she could be "separated at birth", twin or even Elaine herself. Anna always eats, but must have incredible metabolism. Unlike the 1990's soft-grain porn, 70's softie porn kept the realism of the hardcore film (something that the 2000 soft core has brought back to the occasion instead of the 90s music and canvas orgasms) and that's here in full force. It's not right, but it feels right. <br /> <br /> For those who have had Quebec produced "Deux Femmes En Or", you will enjoy this. Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 CAN a month you can spend.
