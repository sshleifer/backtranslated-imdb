Nowadays, most do not see classic movies like this. Most of the friends only watch movies from the 90s present. It's pretty stingy. <br /> <br /> Most old films like this are masterpieces that are unique in their own way. Only because when these films were thought of and made, the ideas were fresh. Now, people are excited just to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. For true fans of classic horror. It's for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator investigating the disappearance of a film actor and stumbling upon three other strange events with former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say more, because I want to destroy the movie more than I already have. But it's a fantastic movie for as old as it is. And would never mind seeing it again!
