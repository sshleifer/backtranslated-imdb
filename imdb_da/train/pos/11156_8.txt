I typically don't like reality shows, especially those that exploit "American Idol" success. But this one I can live with. Comedians from all over the world perform a short routine for celebrity talent scouts, and if they like them, these guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience. Then, ten or twelve comics are chosen to live in a house together and make "Survivor" style competitions using comic tactics. Then one will be determined as "last cartoon standing". I like to stand up with comedy, so this is the only reality show that is interested in my interests. There are usually some beautiful fun comics selected through. It started the career of such talents as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. My negative criticism is that there is a possibility that many of these cartoons were selected for their contribution to reality. show drama. First, they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they've gone away, thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are many comedians I felt were chosen only because they are fun, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc., when other comics should clearly have knocked them out. But in general it is a well-behaved reality show, which is two expressions until now, I thought was an oxymoron.
