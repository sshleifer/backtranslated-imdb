GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize winning game, but did not live to see it produced (he had won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 game PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger mounted (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he had noticed British author Graham Greene making the adaptation and it was a solid choice. <br /> <br /> With a cue from Shaw's own play, Greene uses Epilogue scene material to create a framing unit to report the two actions of the game (one early and one late in Joan's story) to a single and most satisfactory whole. Where on stage the shift in tone has been buffed with a break, here it works just as well with a return to KING Charles Baloiss's bed chamber (where the man Joan put on the throne dreams of the events that led to his current situation), and more material from Shaws Epilogue - the introduction of the shadow of John Gielgud's Warwick. The biggest of the languages ​​is solid GBS and performances by stalwart shauvians (like Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) for relative novices (the movie established Jean Seberg's career) is the first rate. It can crush some, only acquainted with Richard Widmark's many movie chords, to see him play a weak and somewhat stupid Dauphin, but the notion - oddly top-picture - is professional, though undoubtedly overlooked. <br /> <br /> Symbols of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary for black and white filming all serve Shaw and the story well. Go in expecting quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
