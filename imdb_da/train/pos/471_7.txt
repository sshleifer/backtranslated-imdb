This movie star Emily Watson, from Breaking the Wave's fame. This film about a man's occupation takes place on a resort where a chess tournament is held. A chess master arrives and shortly after, falls in love (at first glance) with a woman played by Emily Watson. She falls for this oddball of a man obsessed with chess. It's all about her mother, who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a real gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy to the young woman, as she tends to take on odd animals and such. What follows is mostly a journey through a man's psyche. It tells the story of how his past is closely linked to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the protagonist. It's definitely slow, but it's worth seeing. The end was even satisfactory. :)
