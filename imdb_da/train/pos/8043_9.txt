I've heard people say that this movie is boring boring. I don't think they saw the real movie. This is not the prototypical action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about rookie and his mentor who just happens to kill people. In this way, it works extremely well with amazing performances from Berenger and Zane (who do not sleep through the movie he has in other roles - he actually looks like he's acting). I was disappointed with the action towards the end - much did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the structure of the rest of the film. But see Zane's face while he panic alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
