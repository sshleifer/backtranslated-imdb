Must be one of the best political satires I've seen to date, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well located and a very good unexpected twist at the end. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a big thumb up. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East, and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political opinion or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drunk humor . In places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was the boundary between fun and tragic.
