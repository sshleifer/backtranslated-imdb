I had the pleasure of participating in a screening of The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This movie had caught my attention a little back when I stumbled upon an article about it in Jalouse magazine. Seemed interesting at the time, but nothing too exciting. In any case, I saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless as the final credits started rolling. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I've seen for some time. The photograph, the art direction, the action and the special steering were seamless and impeccable. Nothing is spelled out for you in this movie and makes you think. Something like a large majority of movies today does the opposite. The dialogue is carefully designed, and although this script is not wall to wall chatting, the words words are very convincing and meaningful. It's definitely one of the movies that deserves another view, and the more you see it, the more things you notice. It is a very layered and intelligent movie. Not sure when or where it plays again, but a certain must look for movie enthusiasts.
