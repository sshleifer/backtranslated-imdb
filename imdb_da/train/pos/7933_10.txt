Good times work with Quiroz Brothers and all thrown on this project as "Guy on the Bench." I was amazed at how well they got to capture all the identifiable features of a true "B" horror movie. Hopefully, I will be able to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures teams again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and has been publicly recognized on several occasions since its release. Once was actually in the video store and the girl spoiled almost lost her mind. It was quite fun, and it was my first real autograph moment when I signed the receipt. One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster if the movie was rented frequently and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer. At that time, it rented more than Ring2, which was also a new release at that time ... The title really takes interest in the more urban markets. She also noted on many occasions that the film had not been returned by the customer, which led me to believe that the movie is just so good that people do not want to give it back .... Watch ZoMbIeS when they are in the attic because they get ya! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench 2005)
