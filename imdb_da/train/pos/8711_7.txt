It is beyond my understanding that so much dirt from Norway has been remastered for DVD publishing, and still gems like this do not get a shot at regaining their former glory. I give this a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few Scifi movies that are made for Norwegian television. This movie is nothing short of a movie-historical gem that in many ways obscures the first Alien movie. And my word, Blind Pass was first! Does Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini series? However, it is unlikely that the scene is very similar. Okay, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but in view of that, it is a really well done piece of work from the desolate age of Norwegian film production, which incidentally lasted until the 90s.
