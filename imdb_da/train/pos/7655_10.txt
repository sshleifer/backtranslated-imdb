Since I haven't seen this movie in 20 years, I'm still impressed by it's harsh effect and star play. Of course, a Mr. Mickey Rooney is truly AMAZING in his role as the ringing "Killer". (In connection with another review here-none other than Orson Welles called Mickey Rooney's name as the biggest movie actor too.) I also remember the jazzy-brassy score and the just black-and-white photograph. I love Mic's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning. (I think Stranglers raised it to a line in one of their songs. Get a grip on yourself.) This is a great movie and unfairly buried movie. Let's get it out! Page Note - A recent Film Review magazine gave a great writing on Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", made a few years before "Last Mile" and also with Mickey Rooney. Another rave of Mickey's intense and sympathetic performance. Perhaps it is the beginning of a reason to appreciate some truly outstanding cinematic performances.
