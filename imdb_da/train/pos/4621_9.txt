Considering all the teenage films like "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty In Pink" that are lionized. It is surprising that this one is so ignored. <br /> <br /> There is no gender in it, but sex is thought of, including the idea that it may matter what others think about it. The kids do not always come with their parents, but neither the parents nor the children are seen as always right or wrong, and the parents are not seen as monsters. It is about hero worship. How a girl does a dangerous thing that could have led to real dusters before she realized she was wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie is a little ahead of its time. A child asks another child what birth control she is using. She says she does nothing to need contraception. She answers (mistakenly) "oral sex".
