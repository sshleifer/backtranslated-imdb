I watched this movie while under limited edition, mainly for the news of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It starts almost like a thriller, but is constantly evolving into a fun job full of one-liners and great comic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, while I say this movie is a comedy, it does not forget that it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it should be. When I walked into the theater, I didn't know what to expect much more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Leaving the theater I felt very satisfied with the movie and plan to see it again in the release. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big mustache.
