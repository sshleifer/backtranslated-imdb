Nifty little episode played mostly for laughs, but with exciting spearheads. Somehow, a weird snuck aboard a worn out bus is heading for nowhere, but what a passenger it is (talk about your illegal immigrants!). Star-studded cast from wild eyed Jack Elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy Jean Willes (if she is Martian, then I say let's open the borders!) To cruel face John Hoyt (the most obvious suspicion) along with famous faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a good trip from Bill Kendis as a bus driver). Makes for a very entertaining half hour, although the action is limited to a single set.
