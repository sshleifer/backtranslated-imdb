I argue that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie is completely blundered. No one I know would watch this movie based on the previews, and anyone who actually saw it (as I know) loved it altogether ... The ad campaign is disgrace / disaster / blunder. <br /> <br /> Opened on # 4 bag ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I haven't seen, average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen, great movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (I deserve to say). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie I've seen, okay movie but 4th week out, averaged IMDb score of 8.1 (a little high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but it has been ours for 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> Whether it was bad planning or poor advertising, I think the powers behind this movie are up for grabs! This should have been announced as a great movie that happens to be a fantasy / adventure and not advertised as just another adventure ?? Too bad :( Anyway - Now that I have very pointless ranted on-and-on ... Awesome movie, watch it!
