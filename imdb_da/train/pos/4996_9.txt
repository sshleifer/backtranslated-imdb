I've seen lots of HK actioners and this one is right at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in an action movie. Kung Fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnic eye-popping, stunt-worked heartstopping. The editing is the perfect pace, the enhancement of the excitement and the compliments of the liquid camera work. This film is directed by the old pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is filled with some of the best genres, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If one thing is missing in this movie, it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male leader, comes closest to it. This movie is full of archetypes rather than characters - the sexy killer, the dumb thief, and his bitchy boyfriend, the jerking villains. That said, Shannon Lee has a fantastic screen presence; she is good with the fighting, the stunts and the weapons. When she is on the screen, it is difficult to take her eyes off. She's so good. Why is this woman not a big star?
