Eddie Murphy has really made me laugh my ass at this HBO stand up comedy show. I love his impression of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson too.The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also fun. I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard, I almost fell off my chair. I still think it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> When he was on Saturday Night Live, Eddie Murphy made me laugh so hard he is one of the best people to get out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best stand up performance next to "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.
