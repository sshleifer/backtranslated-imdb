This is just a great, fun, nice movie. It captures the true essence of the decade and the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Although this movie may only be in black and white, it does not count against it now in modern days. The main purpose of the movie is timeless. This film features amazing plays, beautiful song and dance tales, and great design work and movie footage. Follow the fleet is also comical, there are fun moments, moments that make you laugh, but other moments where the play just gets you so involved in the story. It's great, though, this movie can be tuned in a certain decade how it can affect them today. If you want to see something good, check it out here.
