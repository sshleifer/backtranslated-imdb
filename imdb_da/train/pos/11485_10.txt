Zero Day leads you to think, even think about why two boys / young men would do what they did - committing common suicide by slaughtering their classmates. It captures what needs to be beyond a bizarre way of being for two people who have decided to withdraw from common courtesy to define their own / reciprocal world through linked destruction. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie but given what the money / time movie maker and actors had - it's a remarkable product. With regard to explaining the motive and actions of the two young suicides / murderers, it is better than 'Elephant' - in terms of being a film that comes under our 'rationalist' skin, it is a far better movie than almost anything You are likely to see. <br /> <br /> Inadequate but honest with a terrible honesty.
