Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are in this action / thriller written and directed by the thrill of Wes Craven himself. The whole movie starts with some problems at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is all directed by Lisa Reisert, the head of the hotel. Then she goes to the airport and this is where all the problems begin. She meets Jackson Rippner, who doesn't like being called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they board the plane, and it is crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrorized, plagued and shaken by Rippner. I don't want to give anything away. Then we continue to where Jack chases Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay and crazy enough, Rippner is already there. There is almost twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout this scene. In total, there is about 25 minutes of intense action at the end. <br /> <br /> Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot for it. As I said, I will not give anything away because it is so shocking and exciting and somewhat disturbing / scary. And the play from every character in the movie, even those without any lines at all, was all perfect. It was incredible. Everything was amazing in this movie! The action, the music, the effects, the makeup, the director, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the Master of Suspense. Red-eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money on. You could see this movie again and again and again and it would never be boring. Red eyes I have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence and language <br / > <br /> My Canadian rating: 14A: violence, scary scenes, disruptive content
