If The Man in the White Suit had been made in America, could you not see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness Sidney Stratton's size? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the best Ealing Studios in the UK ever showed. It fits perfectly within the timeframe of the new Labor Government and the society it was trying to build. It is amazing how in times of crisis, capital and labor can agree. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness is this clever little schnook of a man obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that never need cleaning, which actually rejects all kinds of foreign matter the moment it touches the clothing. <br /> <br /> He is a persistent cuss and he succeeds. Of course, the implications have not really been thought about what kind of influence clothing it will have on society. In the end, everyone is chasing after him as if they'd fled, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is the character of a large comedy film that a potentially serious situation like the one described in some of the serious films I have mentioned can be played by laughs. Poor Guinness costume is not only white and stain resistant, but it sounds like a neon sign. Other than Guinness are the best performances by Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as her siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, Paramount borrowed the suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
