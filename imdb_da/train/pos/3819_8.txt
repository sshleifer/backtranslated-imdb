I've been waiting to watch this movie for a long time, and finally I could see it in the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I was expecting too much from this movie, and so I was a little disappointed. I wasn't the best movie from Korea, but it's still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The subject was great, and the film makes you watch without being bored even if it is a long time. But there are holes in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon's play is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early cinema history, and I think this movie would not be so nice if she wasn't leading.
