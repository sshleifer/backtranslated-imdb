This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-employed man (Jimmy Stewart) going up to Klondike for gold. Along the way, he gets the hassle of a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, who gives a wonderful viciousness), which he reproaches. McIntire threatens to become a dead man if he ever returns through his city, which unfortunately is the only way back to the states. The most important part of the story is that the peaceful Klondike city of Dawson is turned upside down by new residents of McIntire's city. Ruth Roman, for example, who has joined Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who play Stewart's best friend), build a salon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and try to drive the city's restaurant and hang-out place out of service. She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up as well. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and Director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre The Naked Spur. The remote country is just the smallest bit smaller, and it contains 99.9% of what made the movie so special without feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country has beautiful, on-site cinematography. The landscape is beautiful. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it could be considered clich√© as he starts a selfish lonely and learns how that kind of existence ultimately plays out. Still, Stewart plays it so wonderfully well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting notions are universally amazing. In addition to those I have mentioned, the lovely French actor Corinne Calvet is very good. And I should also appoint Walter Brennen. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, as he is initially the only person capable of producing any humanity in the cynical man. The play is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.
