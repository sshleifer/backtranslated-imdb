This movie is not about a cat and mouse fight, as the other comment shows. Its about a cat who has used up 8 of her 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing her last. The cat is jumping and scared to death all the time, hence the name 'scam'. Fraidy Cat's past life haunts him as ghosts who are from different era in time and are constantly trying to kill him, but he is most afraid of the ninth life represented as a cloud in the form of a number 9 and spitting out lighting bolts . very old now, but will still be fun for the kids if you get a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
