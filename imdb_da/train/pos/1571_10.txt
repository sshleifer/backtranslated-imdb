Not since Spongebob Squarepants I have seen a larger cartoon on television. The colors are great, the voices couldn't be better, the characters are so original, great looking comics. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. Hope the DVD season is coming soon! I love comics like this and I hope more people tune in to see this great cartoon. It's very hard to find the season DVD, so if anyone finds a store that sells it, let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available at Nick Shop is a good lookin shirt but very very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who doesn't? You will also love Catscratch too!
