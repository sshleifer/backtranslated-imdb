I've only seen this movie once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago, and after seeing it, I think it's even better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than just a horror. It had such a fantastic level of emotion and great characterization that runs through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It's such a shame that she didn't do anything else when she was an excellent actress altogether. Her depiction of emotions throughout the movie was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end, when she realized that although Marc was dead, she knew he would be okay. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror movies), especially the stage in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father chased her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke and crumbled into dust. All in all, an excellent and very moving film.
