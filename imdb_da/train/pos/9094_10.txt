I saw this independent movie when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so much fun was that it was based on a true story - fun! It also has some good character players in it. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also wonderful. I remember him from the head of the class. I'm tired of all the dark edgy movies still being made. This is fun and easy, and I can see it with my family and not be embarrassed. I'm watching to see when it comes out on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
