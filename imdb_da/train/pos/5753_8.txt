*** 1/2 out of ***** While I'm not worried that this is an English dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted as it seems to be in many Quebecois native hearts . But it was a movie like a child that I was an avid admirer of; considering that it was now made for children, I consider it relative. The story is about children on a winter holiday, building a huge snow factory and throwing back - to steer with weapons such as snowballs and other collisions, such as inactive hands and leisure the same winter holiday lessons. If I had children, it is definitely a movie I would try to get them interested in as the snow party wowed me when I was young and I think even children today would agree, though with Pixar and the whole computer animation, maybe I'm obsolete and don't understand it. In addition, the film's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive to it for both children (and adults).
