Another very good Mann flick thanks to the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the younger one takes the fork or bend. "You've been wrong Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he only cares for himself, but it is clear that he cannot leave Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as Skagway's law respecting the justice of justice over the reality of it. Another main theme is to help people and in turn be helped by people. Anyone can't do it and suffer for it. <br /> <br /> The caption above reflects Tatum's claim that he cannot live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction turns out to be fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now own the DVD.
