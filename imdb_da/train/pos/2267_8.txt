I haven't read the novel, or anything else by Kurt Vonnegut, but now I intend to start. This grabbed you from the very first frame and doesn't release until the final credits start rolling. If you take places you don't expect, the plot is interesting all the way through. The pacing is spot-on, nothing lasts too long, and it makes perfect work of balancing unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to treat what we have seen. It is well written and well thought out. I have never seen a movie that I feel I could specifically compare to this. It is intense and exciting, as well as fun and sad. The action is excellent, Nolte shines completely, Goodman again shows that he doesn't have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding. I could go on, really ... no role is dealt with to a less than star's performance. Editing and filmography are amazing, and all the imagery is great, with a couple of unforgettable and amazing. I have to go to other movies directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality, and very disturbing and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; It's not comfortable. 8.10
