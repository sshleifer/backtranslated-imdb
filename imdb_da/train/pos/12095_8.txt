When American author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar effort. Don't believe Poe's claim that all his macabre stories are based on the real experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can't spend a whole night at Blackwood's haunted castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone as he approaches various beautiful women and beautiful men and a physician of metaphysics - explaining that they are all lost souls cursed to reproduce the stories of theirs. death on the anniversary of their death! The first time I saw this lovely piece of classic horror, I was fascinated all the time. I found the movie really scary and at the same time carefree. Bab's Steele is unthinkable beautiful. The music scores the atmosphere twice as much as terror-inducing. The topless scene threw me for a loop that I didn't expect it to. It looks like Synapse did a good job of image enhancement because this movie looks wrong in its age, and it's the Uncut International version that starts. This is the film responsible for me starting a Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.
