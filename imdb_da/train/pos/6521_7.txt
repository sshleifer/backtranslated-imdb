Taken in conjunction with the time it was made, I found it a worthy movie. While the details can be 'dramatized', the overall story was a good primer. In addition, I found spotting actors, I knew a real pleasure. Who could imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? I'll let the rest of the star mock you. As for the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made at the end of the thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos for Andrew Jackson's right hand Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships and competent actions throughout, I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for the small camp, or an eye for a double-piece piece set at the beginning of America and made in A period where great names and top notch character actors were a great pleasure to enjoy.
