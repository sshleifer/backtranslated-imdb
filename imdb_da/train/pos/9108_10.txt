A true story of a true revolution, April 25; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years, which introduced a colonial war against the military, to preserve an empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verde, S. Tom√© and Principe, the first and last of the great colonial empire in Europe) in 600 years since it began in the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; a revolution of the army of the people and of a democratic Portugal; The most surprising fact in this revolution is that people were not killed in it (except those who died in the hand of PIDE, the state political police during a brutal shot at an unconscious crowd protesting in front of the headquarters of the Revolution Day, 25. April 1974, it has shown on the film). And having all the revolutions have it here after, one of them was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a return soldier from the war whose convictions with the rest of the army were that they fought (since 1961) a hopeless war and that a soldier sometimes must obey his country.
