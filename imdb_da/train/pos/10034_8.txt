I had problems with this movie and I have heard a lot of criticism saying it is long-standing and over-rated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it is going so fast. I don't think it's overstated at all, I think the IMDb rating is quite decent. The movie looks sumptuous with beautiful costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals all the scenes he is in. The story is very rich in detail, and warm on character development, evident with the love story that moves a lot when it needs to be, even though the first part of the movie is a little slow. The last hour is extremely nit, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat when Titanic sank. I would also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, although I was never a big fan of the song My Heart would go on. The 1996 mini-series were good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give the Titanic an 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
