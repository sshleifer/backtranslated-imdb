This movie is a remake of two movies that were much better. The last one can wait for the sky was great, I suggest you see one. This one is not that big. The last third of the movie is not that bad, and Chris Rock starts showing some of the comics that made him where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like a really bad "B" movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit-com. The situation is forced and it is as if they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the right movie. It all seems really fake and editing is just bad. I don't know how to release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part is not too bad, so wait for the video and watch it.
