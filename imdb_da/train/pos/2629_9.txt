I wasn't sure when I heard about this coming out. I was wondering how stupid is Disney getting. I was mistaken. I found it very good. I mean it's not The Lion King, but it's cool to see another page from a particular point. It was very funny. It was also not one of those corny disney sequels where the animation sucks, it was like The Lion King animation. The only thing that lifted me was the whole cinema's thing throughout the movie. Not giving anything but you know what I'm talking about. I was also fun that it was cool to get most of the throw from the original to return. It was a very good movie over all.
