I was a production consultant on this movie and I also had to do some voiceover work on it, so I'm not completely impartial, but if that was terrible, I'd say it. I thought it was a fun movie, not a critically recognized masterpiece, in any way, but there were lots of laughs along the way. The Bible says that laughter makes it good as a drug so it may be good for your health to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> So many of the actors in this picture had not yet reached their peak at the time we made this movie. Susan Sarandon is, of course, one who has since gone on far greater fame. Melanie Mayron was watched television every week as a photographer in the TV series TV drama series. Robert Englund was later known as Freddie Krueger, who still wondered about people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the Sheriff. He was an excellent comic actor and a really nice, sincere person. We've all had fun working on this show, and I think it's fun coming through.
