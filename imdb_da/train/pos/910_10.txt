It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya back on what he is best at. A story woven around a marriage. It feels nice to have a movie where there is no single scene that you would avoid seeing with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain new elements, you may still like the movie, because of the presentation, the performances and indeed the over all treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. The film is about the fact that engagement leads to love. The portrayal of the changes in the mindset behaves when you become engaged is excellent. The director has certainly given it a lot, and the actors have made it to perfection. Although the movie is slow, you don't mind it because you're so much involved in the story that you just want to continue to see the joy of this recent fiance couple. As a typical RajShree thing, it has many sentimental scenes that will most likely make the viewer jump into tears (especially ladies). But when you get out of the cinema hall, you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
