this is my first review on IMDb, i didn't really want to write one, but since there are only 2 for this amazing movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, i'm not affiliated with movie creators at any way (yes yes how often do you have it before ;-)) FYI i'm in my late 20s. First, I admit that I really like animated movies because what you see is limited only by the creators' imagination, and they were quite imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of history, but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good, but far from real, and it works well for the movie. After all, it's an adventurous world. But the background and the world in general are filled with amazing visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The blue, rabbit-like mini-dragon steals the show and easily has some of the funniest moments in the movie, he is already an instant classic, much like Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes are going to kill the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares about the movie looks and sounds so good ;-) 1 thing I must point out, imo movies are not suitable for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe scary for children under 6-8 I would say it is only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Still, I've had a good time watching this and can't wait to beat the stores in high def to see it over and over just for the sheer beauty of it. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
