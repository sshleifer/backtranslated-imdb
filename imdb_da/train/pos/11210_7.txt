Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was a very lucky lady many years ago. She was the king of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was expensive, and she dedicated herself to giving a sanctuary to the rich on her property. Trudy also raised two chimpanzees in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many facilities. One day she learns about an abandoned baby gorilla. When she didn't know anything about the big monkeys, she trusted her husband's medical skills and expert advice to save Gorilla's life. Trudy decides when she is out of danger that she will also raise the gorilla as one of her children. This works well for years, and Buddy, the gorilla, is truly a remarkable intelligent addition to her home. But, Buddy is also a gorilla, and his strength and curiosity become quite huge. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her monkey develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course, Buddy is not a true gorilla, but a mechanical, in the movie, but he is very close to seemingly genuine. Russo gives a good performance as a lady ahead of her time, and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary, matching the past era of history and the outstanding settings and production values. But most importantly, the animals here are in abundance, not just Buddy, but the adorable chimpanzees, the ducks, the rabbits and so on. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to animal heaven, here on earth, this is a good movie choice. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to see a big family movie, will go "monkey" over Buddy.
