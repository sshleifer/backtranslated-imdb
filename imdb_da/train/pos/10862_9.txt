Choices are a Chinese mob file, or triads in this case. Every two years, a new leader is chosen, and initially it seems to throw up between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai or as I know him, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was a judge in full contact!). Even when Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the election and goes to the lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie I see with mobsters, this is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments when needed, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There are many signs that are really hard to keep an eye on, but I think it plays a bit in the madness. A 100-year-old relay, which is the symbol of power I mentioned before, changes hands several times before things go down. And although it may seem that the movie ends at 65 or 70 minutes, there are still a few great surprises waiting. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and anchored the image. <br /> <br /> Elections were quite award winning at last year's Hong Kong Film Awards, winner of Best Actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Instructor (Johnny To, who made Heroic Trio !!), and Best Manuscript. It also had nominations for movies, editing, movie scores (which I loved) and three more recording performances (including Yam).
