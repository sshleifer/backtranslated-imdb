A very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a larger number of foreigners. We see the leaders of the rebellious alliance and many of the imperial forces. The emperor is something original. I liked Ewoks who somehow represent the original savage and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, which is the best of the saga. In Jedi Back, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over, and the empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory, where it meets the Father's redemption and returns to the Anakin Skywalker spirit with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a grief and a tear. The biggest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When the Wade turns the Emperor. Luke sees and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke hurries back to Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this movie, although there is a good ending. I felt that there was much more than meeting the eye. And as always, John William's music will bring classicism into the Star Wars universe.
