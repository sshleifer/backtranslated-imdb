Since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very wealthy, it was just scary about how real it really was! The action is what gave the film that pushes for greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton portrayed the protagonist, Patsy McCartle, who had two sons whom she loved. Her performance is what made the real life story come alive on a television screen. It was very difficult to see some of the scenes as they were so real, what happens when you become addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this very loving mother go from sweet to not to worry at all was hard, but so true. I have known people who have gone through, and it was much like what happened in this movie, from what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. But it was done so well. I welcome the director to make this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted or just learns what can happen to you if you become addicted to them.
