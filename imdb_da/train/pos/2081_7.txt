1. Watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well said about the farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggling with what Mother Nature throws at them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and chronicles a family starting with their son arranged marriage with a slave girl. The film does a good job of keeping your interest in mind despite a somewhat hammy performance by Paul Muni. The chronicle, Wong Long (Muni's character, and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but returns to the country where he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, which Luise Rainer plays, is History's main thread (in addition to the country itself) and in spite of the obvious non-Chinese actors doing a good job of showing the country and its people, it is obvious that MGM used that money to create a really good epic with this in An era where they could probably afford it The stage of the carobs was done very well, and the rest of the film looks really good to give the Best Cinematography award to the Oscar this year, the final definition of an epic being, what this story is and it is drawn off quite well.
