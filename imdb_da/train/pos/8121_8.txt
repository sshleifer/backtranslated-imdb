The message of a world on the edge of war is ignored by the masses; The mythical city Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could just as well represent any nation in the world. When the war finally arrives, the ravages do not continue for another five years, but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed. The addition to the desert and the toll on humanity is the "migratory disease", a pestilence that continues for another four years. "Things to come" balance both a fatalistic and futuristic worldview, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. The concept of "Wings Over the World" plays a bit corny, even though it is spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) unkempt in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This announcement is constantly being reinforced throughout the film, which is convincingly home to Massey's end of the film talk. Man's insatiable need to test the boundaries of knowledge and achievement requires a "whole universe or no" mindset. <br /> <br /> The film's images of automation and machines in the second half are reminiscent of the large silent film "Metropolis". When Everytown is rebuilt and transformed into the year 2036, the play of the city's rebirth arises as a resonance chord, as modern-day architecture today suggests that the film's honest prophetic vision will come true. When the movie gets it wrong for thirty-seven years, it's man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred-year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969. "Things to come" is one of those rarities in movies, a picture that gets you to to think. Which side will you come down to, the forces of progress in the face of uncertainty or sustaining the status quo? It is not a pleasant question, as both choices provide inherent dangers and unknown results. Those who choose to be spectators risk being swept away by forces without their control.
