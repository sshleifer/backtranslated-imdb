I had heard good things about this movie and you guessed it a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is, as promised, surprisingly good, surprisingly safe at a young age; Really, everyone (small) is thrown quite sturdy, in their simple 50s American environment. The reason I didn't rate this movie higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief that the older sister showed didn't seem so real, and it pushed me a little out of the movie. Maybe we are expected to fill in the plot, or maybe the film should be a little longer. Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the younger) would be traumatized and angry, but why did her sister feel more concerned? Because she is a few years older? Didn't the end undermine the rest of the movie? The pacemaking of the movie makes it seem that Maureen and Court have only met when he is being trapped (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in the rear it might have tried to shock a little. Now it works!) . It depends on what you want - if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems you are coming, you are in a surprise. Man in the moon is both picturesque and dreamy and a hard-to-come movie? a pretty awkward combination? I liked the court's character, although I can see which girls are looking at this, can see. And I loved having the courage to let him hurt the younger sister (most men would, most movies wouldn't) and be killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my pretty tough rating scale. For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor fun.
