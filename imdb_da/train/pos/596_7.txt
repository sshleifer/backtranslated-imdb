This for the television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective, more realistic than previously filmed versions of the events, although the one movie made after that might go too far in human characters by Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> The focus here is on Jim Bowie, played with sharp, cynical detachment of James Arness, who apparently still lives at the age of 85. Then he came back to acting after years away from the screen. to do this part. <br /> <br /> Puerto Rico-born Raul Julia humanizes Gen. Santa Ana as no one since J. Carol Naish left in '54 had done. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous, vainglorious popinjay-gaudier uniforms have never been seen sooner or later. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he has employed, but he is convinced of his own imperfection. He is not aware of that. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate for the character he plays: Col. William Travis. His portrayal is serious. He is almost in awe of the older men who share the command with him. <br /> <br /> The one crushing note was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a coonskin cap and wears Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he had walked in from another movie. With no conviction in the depiction, the grade is reduced to a few stage conventions. <br /> <br /> The scripture reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in previous film versions. We learn that Jim Bowie was in Santa Ana's person, struggling with his own brother-in-law. The Mexican soldiers did badly because they were armed with rifles back from the Napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes a good buy." Bowie explains wryly. The whole project of defending the former Spanish mission as a fort became militarily incorrect - a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "The Alamo".
