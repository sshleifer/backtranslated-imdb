My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Movie and alternative cinema (small hall with uncomfortable seats, the public had to wait while film rolls were changed) was the perfect match. <br /> <br /> There were many clich√©s that were used in the movie, but Fassbinder presented them so wisely that I found them really entertaining. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back is higher than dialogue). Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved the way the post-war era was presented. Really fun! <br /> <br />
