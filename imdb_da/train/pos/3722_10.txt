First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I just knew Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see it at a Danish film festival called the Night Film Festival, which are many different films shown after the hours, the festival is largely specialized in showing films that would otherwise not be shown at Danish theaters. /> <br /> Anyway My friend and I went to see it and we were amazed at how real it worked and that it really hit a line with our feelings, we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "dogma 95", which was started by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In the Dark). The conclusion is that the film is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the American GI Joe coming out of school is expected to serve their country in battle far from home. Colin Farrell is also unique in this movie, I haven't seen him before, but I can't wait to see more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
