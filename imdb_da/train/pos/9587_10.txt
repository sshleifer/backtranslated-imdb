Fifteen years later, and Paris Burning is still aflame. This is a classic in black gay movies, right up there with the other honest black gay films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This usual work captures underground and subclass (ie, "subservient") black and Latin homosexual culture and society as no other work sooner or later, including all the sentimental Harlem Rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings. They are good, but it's the best I say the only "real" movie you find on the subject. It's Relentlessy Cunty (the classic house music invention) comes to Hollywood, non-stop, hilarious camp (like only we do it) and bad social criticism All of this by a white female instructor (who of course must have been a sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a past life.) I could go on, but I think you get the point now: I love this movie!
