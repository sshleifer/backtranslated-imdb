Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of animation art. The perfect skill and artistry that characterizes this duo's work is nothing more than evidence in this comic book. It is a shame that so many people can only see offense in what is and always was supposed to be, a heartbreaking piece of entertainment that in no way tried to cushion black people. If that's something, it's a tribute to the black race and the infectious humor and musicality. I have not been able to see this confectionery for many years when the "race commissioners" in England have found it too offensive to appear in multi racial Britain. If anyone knows where to get a copy, I would love to see this masterpiece again. I think those who routinely look for messages and intentions that were never thought of in these cartoons, which are sixty years old, should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today, But that does not mean that everyone has the right to censor what can be seen from the past.
