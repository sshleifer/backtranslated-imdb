Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American dream. Montana then becomes "king" in the drug world as he tirelessly runs his crime crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are uncomfortable to watch. This movie has about 180+ F words and is nearly three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never be bored. You rejoice for the doctrine, and in some scenes you find out that Montana is not as bad as some other criminal gentlemen. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9.10
