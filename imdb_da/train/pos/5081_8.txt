This movie was amazing, and even with a less than convincing ending, it's still worth seeing. The movie begins when Claudette Colbert is getting married to Robert Ryan. When Minister asks if anyone has any objections, a guy jumps up and announces that Colbert cannot marry because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they examine, they find that the justice of peace and many others remember their wedding, and there is even a signed wedding license! Slowly, it becomes clear that Claudette's mind slips, and people around her seriously doubt her hygiene. So when the supposed first man is murdered, all evidence and suspicion falls on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The movie is an exciting mystery thrill movie, as what I have described so far is only the first half of the movie. The following is incredibly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, however, the conclusion is a bit of a disappointment, as the management behind all this turns out to be "straight out of the left field" - and is confusing as it was so unexpected and impossible to guess from the information given to the viewer. But in spite of this, the movie was so good, I can even apologize for the light end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a good job as a "knuckle-busting" fiance, but apart from him, the other performances were also excellent.
