Eyeliner was worn nearly 6,000 years ago in Egypt. Really not so much of a stretch that it can be around in the 12th century. I also didn't realize that the series was flopped. There is another season airing now isn't there? It's great for me when comments are made by those who are either uninformed or don't see a show at all. It is a waste of space on the boards and in other people's time. The first show of the series might have been a little painful as the cast began to fall, but it can be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the US.
