Everyone plays their part pretty well in this "little nice movie". Belushi gets the chance to live a part of his life differently but end up realizing that what he had would be as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not those we do not or cannot have. If U can get this movie on video for about $ 10, it would be an investment!
