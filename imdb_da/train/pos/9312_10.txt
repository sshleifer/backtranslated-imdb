I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are those where the raptor looks behind the column, because it resembles a scene from Friday the 13th movie with the girl eating the banana. I really love to watch much of this movie because computer graphics seem a little fake, but it's okay, because once you get into the movie, you hardly notice what's going on, and I think it has a good ending , although I did not really understand what was going on in my First Practices I counted on it over time, and that is the important part. The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you see it for the first time. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE.
