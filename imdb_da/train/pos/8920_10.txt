I wasn't familiar with Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew I was extremely scared to watch this movie. (I had been destroyed by the movie "Trantula" aged seven ... but I was ten now). The first scene, where Blob creeps up to the farmer's exploratory stick and engulfs his hand, was enough to make me leave the theater. But I became and suffered during each of our monsters' attacks. I felt such horror when Steve and his girl hardly made it out of the hospital (bad doc) and even more when The Blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience. . . so many in fact that it oooooozzzzed out of the main doors, too big now to fit through just one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in the growth potential, and when it caught poor Steve in a sight-like dining room, he seemed to be a safe dinner. <br /> <br /> Saying that Blob was cold would be a modern description, but ultimately better known than scary and mentally breaking young children. I remember going home there Evening with my Uncle Nick, trying to act bravely. He knew I was in trouble, and when I got to bed tonight I couldn't just feel Blob in the room, but when I called the courage to look down on the floor, the red pulsating, heart-like hungry guy was waiting for me trying to get up and go to the toilet. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old now. . . I have made it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Blob was not destroyed.
