Erotic cinema from the 1970s was pretty much compared to the triple X-bolts today, which is good. Because there is a good story about the naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I want them to have some vampire effects that they had during the time period, and the meat came a little in the way of history a little. Plus some of the accents were hard to understand at times, but it is worth seeing the unedited version then the edited version called THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you don't care about many naked women dancing and having sex, then it's not the movie for you. But I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
