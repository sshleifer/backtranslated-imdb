I just watched this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed !! And if you're not familiar with this director's oeuvre ... it doesn't matter. This movie can certainly stand on its own. I have to go the second screening ... it was great, I have to see it again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very fun. It's the dialogue that is very smart, and the performance of Parker Posey is excellent as she is in the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest feature that regains the world and characters introduced in the movie Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most prominent stylistic function uses the usual use of the angular (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in earlier Hartley works found in various shorts, available in Possible Film: Short works by Hal Hartley 1994-2004, and in The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie most appropriate on September 11th. Lyrically, Fay Grims adventure in this story has been revoked against the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without going into great spoilers, I see this work and the story as a brave political and original portrait of geopolitics that is rarely if ever foregrounded mainstream fictional cinema after 911 so far (cf. Syrianna: by side note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both of these films ... most interesting, for the least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those closely related to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is hilarious self-conscious and self-reflective. That said, Fay Grimm's character starts in the movie, exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended, but at the end of the movie ... Jay's knowledge and experience has totally changed and expanded during the story. What can be in store for the future of the Fay and Fool family ... ?? I can't wait for the third part of this story!
