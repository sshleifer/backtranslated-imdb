Family problems are teeming with real life, and that's what this movie is about. Love can hold members together through the trials and trials, and that is what this film is about. A man, father, has maturity and strength to sustain the family in adversity. The kids grow up, it is all the hard way to realize that no matter how old or a parent is, the parents still love their children and are willing to give them a pillow when they fall. ALL actors who portrayed their characters made excellent performances. Yes, I throw a tear along the way, knowing that I had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true to life is one that every young adult and parent would love to see, although some will not realize it until they are also parents. One must look for those who care about their families.
