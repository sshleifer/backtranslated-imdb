I was fascinated by the title, so in a little piece of insomnia (burned by my curiosity ...) I got up and looked at it. I then checked my TV lists and saw it again! There is a very obvious realization that arose for me when I saw this film - in spite of politics, traditions, culture, etc. Teenagers are pretty much the same everywhere. The characters from the Belgrade children could have been transported to, say, somewhere in the American Midwest during the same period, and language differences aside would be impossible to tell any of the local teenagers of that era. They certainly showed the same growing pains and worries, the politics aside: Music, Sex, Movie Idols, Music, Drinks, Sports, Music ... In fact, much was the same thing that my time grew up in 1970's Southern California. <br /> <br /> It was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it a lot of fun. The characters, especially the young actors, were also completely credible. I do not want to say that this was the Yugoslav "American Graffiti", but I would say that it fits nicely with other 50's theme films.
