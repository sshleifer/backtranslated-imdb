I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single father with a 17-year-old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I want my girl to be so good at solving crimes and helping others! So for me it might be PG level Fantasyland. I read many Nancy Drew books in my teens long ago. Sure this character was very played by Emma Roberts, but didn't look like Nancy Drew, I remember from the books. That's because script, not the actor. <br /> <br /> Emma is a sweet teenager who plays a confident, industrial and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught in the trendy competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot, except that they do not look like the Nancy Drew books and try to figure out which decade we are in. (Like what is the CAR, anyway?) <br /> <br /> I read IMDb overview before I watched the movie when I researched Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to look for more of her films. Rachael was too old to play this leadership, but does a fine job as the adult orphan of the mystery. I am very disappointed with other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with the books, some expect more credible situations or adult action movies. I got what I expected! Good entertainment aimed at young teenage girls, and their fathers who want good children with high standards of behavior and performance. This is a Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! Which one do you want a role model for your teenage daughter?
