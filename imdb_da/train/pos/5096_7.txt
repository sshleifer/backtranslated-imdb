This is a widespread (4 hour) remake of the Rider Haggard story, with the usual added female and a prominent subplot of Russian soldiers seeking a "stone of power" buried with King Solomon's treasure. It is very well shot, giving a vibrant feel to the wide open spaces of Africa, and very well acted. Patrick Swayze is an outstanding Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help save her father. Seated Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and head of the Russian soldiers (not named in the IMDb list) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood cannot leave a good story alone when they adapt it, it is told here, and except that it is too long, I enjoyed it. 10.6.
