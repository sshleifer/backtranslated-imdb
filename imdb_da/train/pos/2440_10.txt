OH WOW. I watched this movie at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and available for questions afterwards. WHAT AND GORGEOUS MOVIE! Although set in Ireland for Catholic / Protestant opposition, history could have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The fear of how fast people can be carried away when they have the chance to vent their hatred and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story that was drizzled with humor and fun. If this is not picked up in the US, it would really be very unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and the supporting players ... FIRST RATE. They call Orla Brady the Irish Meryl Streep I heard. It is my opinion that she is better than Meryl Streep. They would call Meryl the American Orla Brady! And Liam Cunningham's firm and powerful depiction of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant. Watch this movie.
