This is a movie that takes time to get out of your head once you've seen it. The dialogues are close to perfect, as one might expect as it has been adapted from a game. The actors simply give their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss! Yvan Attal is completely credible in her role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) who gives so much pleasure to her eyes as the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve provides an excellent approximation of the overall jerk (and proud to be so) and Marina Fois is the stupid friend who always blames when you expect the least. <br /> <br /> Thumbs to Bernard Rapp and Associates to customize this great game and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more of them in today's production. If you liked it, you'll probably also enjoy: "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by the couple Bacri / Jaoui.
