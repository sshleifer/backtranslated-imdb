This was the black community as before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap and AIDS, who occupied the ghettos in the eighties. Decent, hard-working families struggling to pass by and all the trauma and hardships they faced. Black America was another group of people in the seventies. Still filled with hope and floating high on civil rights in the 60s, times were difficult, but still worth fighting for. Keep your head over water and make a wave when you can, this show showed how the black community struggled to work together as human beings and families before they started exchanging each other and everyone else to survive the ghetto's horrors. It is heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos were then and what they have become now.
