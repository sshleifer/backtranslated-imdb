Letters without a destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office. Here Alice manages to land a job hoping to find her lost father. What she discovers is the dreaded soul of his boss, Frank. A quiet little Aussie flic who came and went to the cinema. Now you'll find it in the deep dark corner of the video store, overshadowed by fifty copies of the dreaded GODZILLA movie. It is a pity because it turned out to be a satisfying film that tells a brave tale with strong simple images and effective notions from the two leaders. This movie succeeds when Garry Marshall's second dead letter office flic Dear God (1996 - USA) failed and comes close to the glory, not Kevin Costner's turkey, but He Jianjun POSTMAN (1995 - China).
