I think I really love this movie. The "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later called it French in 1930. Despite the fact that someone else's voice is called over her, this is an amazing tour de force for Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voice is called by the legendary Edith Piaf helps to mollify us purists of dubbing deception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first see her on a resort with her macho girlfriend, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her inside the car that changes into the bath. Lulu is very free to show her body and it is not good with Irish Others. When Lulu is considering applying for the title 'Miss Europe', we know that a happy ending will not be at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women. We see lots of baths and the reactions from the men are staring at them. But in the center of it all are the magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind watching movies from the past eras, consider checking this one out. Louise Brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs might easily know, but as soon as you see her you will be fascinated and you want to know more. See also her in 'Pandora's Box' if you can find it. Be careful with the American Kino DVD release. I don't know if their projection rate is correct. Much of the scenes seem to be showing at too fast speed. This may have been the way they were shot. I do not know. But since it's the only way to watch this movie, it's worth swallowing one little bitter pill.
