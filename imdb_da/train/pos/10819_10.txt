Sure this movie wasn't like. 16 blocks, inside man, an American haunting. etc. But <br /> <br /> But it was a wonderful mystery that can happen to any of us. I found this movie really good and scary. I live exactly where they filmed this movie "san pedro, california" And we have heard true stories based on events of this movie. <br /> <br /> I dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in the long beach "Queen Mary" Well that boat is haunted. I believe in damages, illusions and parallel or whatever you spell it. is genuine. everyone is in their own universe. <br /> <br /> The mind is a strong thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. It's great and not bad to control at all. <br /> <br /> For those who rate it a 1. they don't understand the movie. its importance. its plot, its view. and how bad the sea life can be for each of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
