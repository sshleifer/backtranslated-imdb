My personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line for the first john joiner's vampires, but I don't care that I LOVED it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was fantastic in this movie. He really sad me think he was the person you would never believe he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the story, there should have been more to the movie. There should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movie story line and they should have had the same main characters in all three vampire films. I really liked the clothes that people wore and the attitude they choose in Mexico. I liked how old Mexico was and not New Mexico. with clay houses and the old fashion churches. I was a little confused with the vampires and how they could go to churches, but it was cool how they didn't follow Dracula's vampire rules.
