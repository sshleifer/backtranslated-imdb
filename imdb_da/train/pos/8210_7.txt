Clint Eastwood represents his role as Dirty Harry, this time on a vigilante (Sondra Locke) case, killing the people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood does his role and the movie is mostly more action, so talk, not that I'm complaining. Sudden consequences are really entertaining entertainment.
