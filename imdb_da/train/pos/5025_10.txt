Man, some of you have people to relax. This film was artistic genius. Instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand it's a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment, for the sake of God (no saying is calculated). It seems to me that for many of these here, trying to be film critics - and they are not doing well. I am so impressed with the movie and Bill Paxton's job of leading me to contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you are not trying to analyze the heel out of the possibility of the story, you can just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did it!
