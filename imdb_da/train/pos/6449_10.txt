I was taken to this movie by a friend and was skeptical of a Swedish movie with subtitles. But I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was exhibited safely without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to hide their eyes for a few short seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfying fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and traits. I especially liked how the movie managed to solve several aspects of hypocritical human behavior that pertains to disruption, discrimination and affection. An absolute gem of a movie that I want to promote to anyone who wants to listen.
