An insomnia's nightmare is the story of a man's leap in madness. After chronic insomnia, Jack is suffering from hallucinations; which causes him to try to determine what is genuine and what is not. <br /> <br /> We find interesting things about Jack close to the end and think that when the movie is over, we will have a "happy just after" Hollywood ending. Wrong. This is New York City, the place where nobody sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (Writer and Director) even has a good movie in 'An Insomniac's Nightmare'. A talented filmmaker and writer (she made this movie right after her high school graduation), she has real potential and will be one to see in the future. <br /> <br /> As I watched this short movie, I was constantly uncomfortable; between music, gloomy scenery and realistic depiction of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), I desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.
