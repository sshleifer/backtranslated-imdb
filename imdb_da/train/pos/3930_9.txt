It is noteworthy that for "Young Mr. Lincoln's" supportive players, Ford is less well known, other than star players. This not only enhances the film's focus on Lincoln's central character, but also gives the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man involved, every one of us incredible, in the problems and feelings of his time and seeking their way of solving them. It is not so much through Fondas Lincoln's words and actions, but in the faces the reactions of the supporting players tell that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln's worldview, sense of community and politics, and how the people responded to Mr. . Lincoln's words and deeds and put their trust in this man whom they considered to have earned their respect and swelling. <br /> <br /> Give this a try: Instead of focusing on Henry Fonda the next time you see 'Young Mr. Lincoln's shift your focus to the supporting characters - you want, I expect, be beautifully rewarded with a deeper understanding of both Lincoln and Ford. I would like to suspect that Ford's storytelling through the supportive characters 'reactions to Fonda's Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he instructed Omar Sharif in' Doctor Zhivago ', where it's the supporters' reactions to Zhivago, who actually tell Zhivago.
