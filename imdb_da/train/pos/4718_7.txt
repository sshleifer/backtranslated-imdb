This movie was made in Hungary, I think. Anyway, the scenery is beautiful, the people who play farming people were absolutely fascinating. Their horsemanship is amazing. I got more into the native people, the farm life, and how heroic they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis, where they were searching for the parachutists. They have even sacrificed their lives in several cases. The young parenthood that Brady befriends was a sweet child. You will wonder about the riding I believe and the act of trying to evade the Nazis. It is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. Ladies have hankies handy, which you will be destroyed at the end. I own it and have seen it several times. In other words, not just once around flick. it's a keeper ...
