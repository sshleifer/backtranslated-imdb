Before movies like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Suspiria' and 'Halloween' the display of horror changed forever, there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre. Films like the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were the frightened and thrilled audience throughout the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I rented this movie during my childhood, but I did because there was something about it. I didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombie movies from the 70s and 80s and movies like this production from the famous but unfortunately far away Amicus movie company was a good start. Benefits: A great, eerie music score. Strong performances from a cast. Brilliant cinematography. Lots of good old-fashioned excitement and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes. Some joking moments and pictures. Moves slowly, but still. The house is a creepy, oppressive home. Fantastic production design and set decoration that gives the film a really old gothic frightening feeling. Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's excitement. Disadvantages: Some pacing problems in the first half. Apart from 'The Cloak', the rest of the stories feel they have been done before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, 'Waxworks', has fine plays, and these are moments, but are the weakest of the four in terms of frightening and excitement. The low budget really shows up at times. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: After watching this movie for the first time in many years, I can see why I rented it so often. It is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. See it here with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
