The pilot is extremely well done. It describes how the characters bind in future episodes. I don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. It shows remarkable creativity on the part of the author. Although not everything was corrected because it was the very first episode, many events occurred in future seasons in the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachel's future relationship. Although the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overcome by a fantastic plot and excellent cast choices. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to an unmatched comedy!
