I grew up with this as my all-time favorite movie. The special effects are incredible for the era and won awards. I remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It is simply a great, timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is the best cinema story. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big villain. I have a copy within reach, for the next trip down the memory path. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants out of its genii bottle!
