Back to the 3rd floor is the comic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber of Shaolin, where Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and a great fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays a rude loser who has to learn kung fu after having his friends beat. He mimics the original Shan Te, tries all kinds of tricks to get into the Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually get some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses. Its a classic light-hearted martial art story, with Shaw Brothers ace production values ​​and Lui Chia Liang's safe foothold. The choreography is amazing throughout, whether for battle or slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu's performance, like the others, especially the sympathetic monk work is perfect for the material. The film is less epic or deep than some of the other stars' work, and there are probably bigger, more violent and sweeping Shaw Brothers movies. But few have such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and combat, with a subtle but warming tale of a useless guy doing good. Full of heartfelt joy, it is impossible not to give this the highest score.
