For what it is, it's a really good movie. I like both John's -Stamos ("Full House") & Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances. The interest of love is ok, but it's more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hated to see them paint over "14 layers of hand-woven lacquer" with good old Army Olive Kills. There is a small story lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I don't know if the training was like this bunch! The film kept my interest all the way through without coming slowly anywhere, with good riding sequences. I love watching the stamp demographics - an 18-year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, I think). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I gave it a 8. I don't weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were big budget, with big actors that you expect to be good, so when they fail, they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
