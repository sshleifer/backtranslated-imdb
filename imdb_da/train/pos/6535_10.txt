This was a great movie! Although there were only about 15 people including myself it was fantastic! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mother enjoyed it herself. There were two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the part where Corky and Ned are like both Nancy and things are sweet lol. And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there. Yes This was a great movie, even thought people underestimated it lol. Go See what I bet you will enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and so did my friend. <br /> <br /> People were so hard on this movie and they hadn't even seen it. I'll bet next time they'll give movies and actresses a chance. They all did a good job in my opinion. But if you have young children, it is still appropriate. I'll probably take my 7 year niece to see it too.
