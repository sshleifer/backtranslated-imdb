From a modern sensibility it is sometimes difficult to see older movies. It's annoying to have to see the stereotypical wall flower librarian having to take off the glasses and be beautiful and stupid to win a man. Especially such a low and unstable man. He is, of course, a player (I wouldn't trust him to be true to her) who doesn't want to settle down who only looks at stupid attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after she completely changed her appearance and life for him, he only goes to her after he (probably) has been rejected by another woman and learns that Connie used all his money to renovate a boat for him. I wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chasing him! His sudden conversion within a few minutes was completely unrealistic and didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from that subplot, I liked the movie. How do you not like sailors dancing with each other? (You can tell they were from San Francisco .... D) The "dance dance" was amazing so Ginger Rogers purposefully dropped in and out of the "correct steps" was amazing. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with the beautiful costumes and art deco sets was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We saw the sea" (although they used it sometimes too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Still, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were ok, but the dance was worth watching the movie. I wish they could have shown some shots from San Francisco as it was where the movie was supposedly set. It is also strange to see such a beautiful flute film with knowledge of what Hitler already did at that time. I have to try to suspend all knowledge to immerse myself in a built-up fantasy land.
