This film deals with the cruelty of Derry 30 years ago, commonly known as Bloody Sunday. <br /> <br /> The film is well-researched, acted and directed. It is as close to the truth as we will get until the result of the Saville study. The film puts the cruelty into the context of times. It also shows the soldiers' wildness on the day of cruelty. The disgusting white wash, which was the Widgery Tribunal, is also treated. <br /> Overall, this is an excellent drama that moves and shocks. When the Saville report comes out, watch this movie again to see how close the truth is.
