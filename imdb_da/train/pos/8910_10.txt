Most of the Atomic Age monster movies I watched on television as a child, and some of them, BLOB included, scared the daylight out of me. Films like INVADERS FROM MARS made it all too clear to us "little roast" that kids just weren't reliable when it comes to things that invade Homeworld; BLOB just repeated that fact. I remember, boring, late at night spent stretching on the floor watching as Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society. There was a summer in the early 1980s when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran a classic Atomic Age classic every weekend. These were 16mm film, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "BLACK" print was inked to a faint pink - but it was fun, man. I pulled my mother together and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It was there at the science museum that I really fell in love with BLOB. The filmmaker's intention, of course, was to make money - but it was the sincerity of everyone involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players) who made me fall in love with this movie. Corny? You can believe that. Cheap? They don't get a cheesier. But man, what a movie!
