In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as a young queen Victoria of Britain, when she is suddenly thrown into the throne at the age of 18, learns to rule in spite of the politicians' affairs and eventually romances and marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (although surprisingly true to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Watching this movie about British royalty spoken in German adds to its cozy charm. On that front, one wonders why an Austrian film was made about an English queen; but it is recalled that in 1954 Austria was still occupied by allied troops, including British. Perhaps it was one of the reasons for this movie's existence.
