All I hear about is how little the animation is done. It may not be up to what everyone expects, but look at it this way. Want to expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation was done dry and gritty on purpose. It was great to see his character transformation in this movie, as it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get. I hope for a successor very soon. If we want living action, I think we can be better with chastity or Purgatori. I don't think Lady Death would transfer well to movies. But be it as it can. It is my own personal belief that all the naysayes about this movie are dead wrong. No sayings are calculated.
