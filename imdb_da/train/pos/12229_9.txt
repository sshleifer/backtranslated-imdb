For me, there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low budget sci fi. As a child in the 50's, everyone is there. In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" in a movie theater with my father. It had the Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. It's also about a space mission that has gone bad, where the astronaut turns into a grizzly assassin. Scared Good & Plenty right out of me. The memory of these heebie-jeebies still lives in me. The incredible melting man is almost a reproductive only in full brilliant color ... that's where the scenes were well lit. Just love it for what it is ..... just over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting sounds and the eerie music. Bravo!
