Almost 30 years later I remember this original PBS film as almost unbearably sore. I regularly check here on IMDb and hope someone has made good sense to buy the rights and put them on a DVD. It's September 2004, and I still hope - deeply sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main players went on to a small career primarily in a first-class evening soap; the other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie, which was produced as I remember it, on a short-lived PBS series that featured original screenshots of new and upcoming playwrights. <br /> <br /> I saw it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. It was before the era of video recorders, so I have no record of it except in my eye. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 addition to the above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the author's own personal copy.
