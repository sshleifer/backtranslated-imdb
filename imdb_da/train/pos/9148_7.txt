A very underestimated film that tells the story of a young musical trapped in an ever-decreasing spiral of domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Sometimes hard to see while Morris Day is portrayed as the misogynist, prince knighting (motorcycle) steed, he is still called to beat a woman twice as part of the manuscript. That he can do this and still appears as a flawless but fair hero is credit for the letter. The Prince is so free of ego in this movie that he not only exhibits as a narcissistic megalomania beating women, but his most famous song is fictitious as written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Furthermore, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (nevertheless, the album's weakest track) and Darling Nikki - are shown as songs that kill an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the Princely ego is a card that indicates (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia as 5'6. <br /> <br /> The almost complete amateur cast is mostly band members who play themselves (and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms they have never appeared in other films, are missing the point altogether) and do it well under the direction. Morris Day gets most of the plaudits to his lovely ham, although Jerome Benton also needs to get credit for jumping off him well, especially their scene action, which is fun. Day and Benton even go as far as making an Abbott and Costello routine fun, which requires something. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Prince. Although I admit to bias, I actually think he is a really good actor in portraying a key version of himself. Acting is not his profession, this was a movie made for entertainment, so someone pointed out that the lead star is not Robert DeNiro, and that they think they are doing a point is unfortunately confused. I do not want this review to be a jailed attack by others' comments, but I even slated this movie as having a low budget and being darkened. How would a movie about domestic violence be shot then? With full overhead spotlights and a CGI dinosaur going into the frame? <br /> <br /> The movie almost seems like a perfect snapshot of the neon light and the thin tie era ?? Until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths, and it's no retro recreation. Prince's best movie with Oscar-winning music, it sees him in his pitch, and it's sad to realize that even if he wanted to make some nice albums, he would never again catch the high one.
