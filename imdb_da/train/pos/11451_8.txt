A very engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work mostly consists of ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., blowing away when the power reaches the beach or the wind blows on the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works do not really work, except as pictures or films of what they were. Now one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality or words in that direction, but it is not easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype of artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in rugged urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious family-oriented person who loves nature and living in a small village in Scotland (of course I am sure they are the same reasons why he was scolded by some people in the art world who found his works fluffy or shallow).
