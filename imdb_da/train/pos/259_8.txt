For a Danish movie I have to say that this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It is in a class itself but it has an international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a large budget and is the leading role of famous Danish players and a few newcomers who play very well. It can be seen by anyone who likes adventure and a little bit of "ghost film". <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid, be thrilled!
