This adaptation of MR James's short story 'A View From A Hill' was first shown on British television in 2005 on the light-watched digital channel BBC 4. I saw that it was repeated again on BBC 4 and decided to give it a go and Remember the BBC's successful 1970s adaptations of other MR James stories, including "Whistle And I Come To You My Lad" and "The Signalman." Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, 'A View From A Hill' is a fun and sometimes exciting drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small village to review the collection of a recently deceased collector of ancient artifacts. While out in the country, he sees a monastery that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with an old binoculars and a cruel legend about the uminously named Gallows Hill? And what does the brewery and his servant know about the situation? While I was not scary in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and if the maturity was longer than 40 minutes, it could have been a really good fit. As it is, it all feels a little hasty and a little more exhibit to set the mood would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
