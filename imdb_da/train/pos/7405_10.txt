This movie is simply amazing! It has it all: laughter, sorrow, beauty, poetry, truth. All in a simple but intense story - like life! You won't be distracted for a second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone tells Hollywood you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories out there.
