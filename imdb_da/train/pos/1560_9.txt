This is a reunion, a team and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to decision, Clark has made an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled fate to a superman who, as a green arrow, puts his feelings to his few dear ones, ready to save the entire planet. This is not just an exciting story of teamwork, loyalty and friendship; It's also about determining what's more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end but I hope the subsequent episodes strictly adhere to what Justice shows without any "rewind" pushing and putting a good end here at Smallville --- and a wonderful beginning of Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and the Team. Nine stars have to give it enough credit.
