Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing but playing football when she joins a local team, she must lie to her parents again and again as they would never approve her to hunt the dream, they will have her beat sit down with a nice Indian boy and learn to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it as Beckham is a very fun feeling good movie that doesn't have to be deep and complex, it's just fine as it is. The game is very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly, and the script is very realistic and fun. <br /> <br /> A great family movie 8/10
