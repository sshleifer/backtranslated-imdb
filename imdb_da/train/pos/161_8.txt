This silly movie is really fun for the younger audience. Its hero is a few dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes bring them down to some very stupid ways. Chasing the big murder case, you will see these detectives go to any length to solve the crime. No nudity, but lots of sexual implications, slapstick silliness ... all too young goes for. Low budget, but very entertaining. Definitely cool classical potential.
