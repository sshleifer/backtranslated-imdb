I've watched this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and emotional to see. The play is amazing, which is not hard to believe, as it is Daniel Day Lewis, a great actor. Brenda Fricker is the surprising wonder in it. She catches your heart as the mother of a physically handicapped boy who is unable to walk or talk until he is in his late teens. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough good things about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies based on actual events or just enjoys good dramas in general.
