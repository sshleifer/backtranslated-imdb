The Movie was sub-par, but this Television Pilot provides a good stepping stone to what has become an Sci-Fi fans Ideal program. The actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite shows.
