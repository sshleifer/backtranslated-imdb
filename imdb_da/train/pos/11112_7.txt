Take a piece of GOODFELLAS, mix it with GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and lots of lowbrow comedy, and you have SOPRANOS, a mob clan operating off northern New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire James Gandolfini's very complicated Tony Soprano, a psychopath with an occasional conscience science. I have also come to admire tea parties from people like gravel-domed Dom Chianese as the confused but murderous Uncle Junior, silver-haired Tony Sirico as the perpetually perplexed Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the relentless, hard-like nails Carmela Soprano . Violence is sudden and graphic, the body count is steadily increasing every season, but it is often the small moments that matter most here. See Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli late LAW & ORDER) as they are lost in Pine Barrens and sit a bitterly cold night in an abandoned trruck, both convinced they've had it.
