It has been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to tell us that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes GG persona and morphs it into a Secret Service Agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. Detailed work on showing the security measures taken by the SS on behalf of the president and the first lady was also exciting. All the leads were pretty good, but try as I might, I couldn't accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster just made you suspend faith and really believes she was the FBI agent Starling in "Silence of the Lambs", you don't get the same feeling with Longoria. Nevertheless, this is a fun movie, escapist entertainment with Beltway as a backdrop.
