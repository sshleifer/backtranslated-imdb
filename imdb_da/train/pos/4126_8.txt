What an evening. Perry Mason then has Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at. 10.30 came "Sea Hunt" with its wonderful opening theme music and Mike's boat sails for a new adventure. Fantastic. Regardless of the story, it was the protagonist (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A man's husband and a boy's husband. This brought interest to boats that lasted for years. Why they don't show on cable or make it available on video, no idea .. Too bad.
