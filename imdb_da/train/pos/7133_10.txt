Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Goodnight Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies all the time. No one should miss watching this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as the tough old man who becomes a soft father figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like 'the Bymus and the landmouse'. A really heartbreaking movie. The director knew exactly how to convert the book into movies, and he has done very well. The film was so brilliantly shot that the feelings of the characters and what happened, made the audience feel a number of feelings from love to fear, and these feelings could turn a six pence. Seen in a turmoil in the Second World War, this film also shows the difference between the cities and the landscape, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must see, those who do not miss a truly amazing and brilliant movie.
