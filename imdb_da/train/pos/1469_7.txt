I admit to creating great expectations before I see, because some friends mentioned it (and they are not pervs!) As one should see. And it's a must see! Just don't expect to see any outbreak. <br /> <br /> The Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the movie, but there is just too much perversion and it doesn't end in the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcocks and maybe a few more I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville) and I don't usually miss things unless they are too obvious or light in the air. Other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is comfortable in the sense of noticing some perversions that our unconscious feeds give, and hence the commercial success most thrillers studied and used as the basis for this theory. I really enjoyed the magic tone of the story and Mr. Zizek's efforts to revive Freud's theory, which has long been numb, especially in North America. Again, it is far above the top and I do not think it is a waste of time, because I think most people have a dark understanding of death and blood.
