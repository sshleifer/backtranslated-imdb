Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of different quality, but most of the films he made in his homeland are undeniable masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's beautiful male lover. Meanwhile, the writer is plagued by strange visions - initially they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but he quickly begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some form of performance. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you believe they are about something, but then you realize that they are about something completely different. This is one of those films; a thriller during the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great filmography by future director Jan de Bont. Highly recommended!
