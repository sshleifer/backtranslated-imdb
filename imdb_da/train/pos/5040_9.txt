I first saw the trailer for Frailty at Yahoo Movies back in the day after hearing Stephen King praising it for the high heaven. Not really a fan of any star, I would still see it because I'm a big thriller fan. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The action was amazing, especially from the two young boys. Normally, I do the child's actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton did a great job of managing it too. It was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> You also have to notice the plots. The three words at the end hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them coming. The film's final twist, combined with the weight of what was just revealed, gives me chills today, even though I've seen movies again so many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
