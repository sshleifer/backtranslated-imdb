If the answer to this question is yes, then enjoy this excellent movie. I just watched it a few hours ago here in Paris (where the film's action takes place) and I still feel the big trauma I got behind in my eyes ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and such a drastic change in the way of making animated movies. I strongly believe that there will be a before and after "renaissance", like what we experienced with Pixar movies or Akira and GhostInTheShell experiences. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies, and I hope this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with a few young people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will Receive the success and recognition it deserves. Vive la France!
