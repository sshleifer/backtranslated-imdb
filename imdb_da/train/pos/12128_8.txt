I just watched "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost scary movie. I loved how the music went with the pace of every step of Philips feet. It gave me chills for some reason ... One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you see Bette Davis coming in just before your eyes. She is amazing, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was so fun to be as vicious, gritty and incomplete as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risk taker who would always be different and that's right when She began to realize that she could be as uncomfortable and daring as she wanted, and people would love her for it. If you're a true lover of movies, it's great to see ... <br /> <br /> She just had a way to deliver a line that made the part and the movie for that matter belongs to her. Like "A lot of music and fire. It's me ... an old kazoo and some sparklers" or "But you're Blanche, you're in that chair!" or "with all my heart I love the man I killed !!" ... they are from a few of her movies, but you get my drift. She was just as brave, sweet and exotic with the beautiful big eyes. Having seen this, I can't believe it was done twice ... Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent to love. I thought he was sweet and couldn't understand how everyone didn't fall for him, but then everyone was again ... except Mildred. He did a good job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early movies. They would make a character so hateful that it is almost unbelievable that anyone would actually fall for them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. It's just the simple truth ... See it !!
