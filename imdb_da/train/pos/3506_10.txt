Peter Sollett has created a welcoming portrait of real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as known to locals. <br /> <br /> Mr. The heart of the soll is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family, typical of the country's various inner cities. Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he presents. These are basically good kids, parents' children who have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Soleet a positive side, they all have. These children do not go into drugs or steal because they are poor. Had this story been done by Hollywood, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of children struggling but deep down, they will not be defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is a natural. So is July Marte. Her character shows us a no-nonsense who won't fool or drive to do something she doesn't want to do. Altagracia Guzman, the grandmother is excellent. She conveys her frustration by not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that is so important to her. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was an excellent picture thanks to Peter Sollett.
