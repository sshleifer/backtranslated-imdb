I've watched this movie twice now and think it's pretty good for the limited equipment used to make this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory of migration of South American pre-Cuban Indians to the islands of Polynesia when the navy fell off large balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and the crew as they choose balsa trees in Equidor and float with them down to the river to the Pacific for fitting in Peru. They start on a 101-day garden adventure that tests the potency of their primitive raft survivors only by using the natives of the era. Look for yourself, a real adventure!
