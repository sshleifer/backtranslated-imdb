This movie is pure Elvira and shows her on her breast ... I mean best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and brought to life by Elvira's wild and charm. The viewer gets the opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with prejudices from the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she has traveled from Los Angeles to attend the reading of the will of her great aunt Morganna) and at the same time trying to help the long-term teens who have been fun of the matriarchic chastity of Paria and the rest of the city council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who also has a look at Bob, but it is hardly worthy of his love as Elvira. And later in the film she also stands for the complications of being descended from '' a great metaphysical celebrity '' and the witchcraft's accusations brought against her, which means she will be burned on the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this movie, while jumping risque jokes and delivering dual meaning off-beat lines. <br /> <br /> This movie is inspiring because it never tells you if it gives up on yourself and always tries to follow your dreams. Ultimately, Elvira's dreams finally become reality, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and solid woman. I've seen this movie countless times, and I never get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself imprisoned throughout the film. A review will not be entitled to the actual movie, so I can just tell you to PLEASE see it because it is one of the best movies ever made! Meanwhile, I wish you '' unpleasant dreams! ''
