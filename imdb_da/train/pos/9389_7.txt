Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage becomes involved in a deadly crime without first knowing it, and the domains lead to increasing danger, adventure and mishap in the wild-boar American West of the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes fun, and Cage pulls off the mix with its usual sardonic white and cautious ease. <br /> <br /> Is the plot over the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost sympathetic killer? Yes. Is Cage A Chance? Now you have to see and see. It never stops and it surprised me the first time I saw it. At another show yesterday, I was surprised at how well it stopped, how well it was built, and how macabre and fun it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is known more for his television work, but with Rounders and this movie he shows a handful of sensational plots. It is saved by his humor and by the caricatures. The line is blurred, the police questionable. And don't miss out on a truly inspired cameo by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
