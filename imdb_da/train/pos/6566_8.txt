Have you ever wondered where the ideas for Romanesque novels and other papers released come from? According to 'Jake Speed', they are based on real people living out of the adventures they write about and publish. This movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence and skimpy clothing at worst. The language is also not a problem and the jokes are fun at all levels. This is an 'Austin Powers' look at 'Indian Jones', without Michael Myers over-the-top antics. I highly recommend this movie for kids in 10 to 15 range.
