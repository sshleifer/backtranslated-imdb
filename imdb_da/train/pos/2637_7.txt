This is a straight-to-video movie, so of course it has to say it will not compete with the first Lion King, but it has been pretty good. My kids loved this, but it's a given they love something that is a comic book. The big shock was that I also liked it, it was very fun in some parts (even the fix jokes), had lots of pretty creative ties with the first movie and even some jokes you might be older to understand (but without to be risqu√© as in Shrek ["do you think he compensates for something?"). <br /> <br /> One particular note of speeding, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet sounds (in fact there were almost no sounds / imagery at all, the references were actually quite subtle), they actually had a setup / punchline / etc and was almost in good taste. I want my kids to think there is more to humor than to go to the toilet, and this movie is fine in that regard. Hmm what more? The music was so-so, not as creative as in the first or second movie, but lots of fun for the kids. No painfully corny moments, which was a blessing to me. A little action, but nothing too scary (NIMH's Secret gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was appropriate for one ...) All in all, this is a good movie for kids in all ages, one that is 100% sure to let them see (I'm not trying to be too sensitive, but I've had to jump up and off the TV during a couple of movies that were less child-appropriate than expected) - But you are sure to leave the room beneath it. I mean to stick to anyway, even though you might find that you enjoy it too :)
