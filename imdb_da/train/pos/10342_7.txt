Melvyn Douglas once again gives a polished performance in which he is in this time in a detective who cannot place love before duty and adventure, and the very beautiful Joan Blondell (who is not illiterate, as a reviewer suggested, wrote one novel about her early life) is as entertaining as ever as his long-standing boyfriend. It's almost a scrubbing comedy, almost a thin man-type movie, almost a series, I think, it didn't quite make a sequel. It doesn't really get classic status, but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script, fine character actors and direction that keeps everything moving fast enough so you hardly notice that Williams (Douglas) is not exactly Columbo when it comes to discovering. I wish there were more movies like this.
