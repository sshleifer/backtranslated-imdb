A movie about wannabee's, never-was's and less-than-heroes does it against all odds. Where have we heard it before. But when the unfortunate ones are Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know, this is not your conventional rags for wealth history. <br /> <br /> A classic performance by Eddie Izzard like Tony P. one of disco boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows the actual thought went into the casting. <br /> <br /> Even at first glance, Greg Kinnear is an odd choice for Captain Amazing. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are sick of cartoon-gone movie stereotypes. Why couldn't anger be a superpower?
