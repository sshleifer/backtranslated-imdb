Back in the day, if Marion Davies had had her druthers and not just listened to William Randolph Hearst, she had made several films like Show People and been much happier. In fact, when you see her getting her first big break in two wheel comedies, she would have loved to have done so in her career instead of such epics as When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see on all accounts at Show People is the real Davies, a gifted comedienne, a great imitation and a generous kind hearted person. She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire, she put up with her part of affection in her Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> If the Show People plot was put into the legitimate stage, you would call it a backstage story. I think it's one of the first movies about the movies you could call it behind the camera story. Marion is the eager young hope that comes to Hollywood like so many others, looking for that great break. She wants to drama, but her introduction to the films is like the foil of the burlesque comics. She gets her share of pie and seltzer on her face, but teaches her trade. And also the heart of the young comic actor William Haines wins. <br /> <br /> She gets her first big break, but it doesn't come for Haines either, and Marion is allowed to make legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli, playing Andre Telfair, pretending no account Count of Avignon. Someone here took a shot at actress Lou Tellegen, girlfriend and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear tell about it, one of the most despised people in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Viewing People was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearance of stars as themselves. You will see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc. Just being in and around the film colony. This in itself makes Show People a movie that is worth saving. <br /> <br /> Show people have also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like, we are not fun, I sit on top of the world, You will be surprised, California, here I come. When the film came out on the sound, a song called Crossroads was introduced into it. It's not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and the girl who sings it in the soundtrack. I assume that since they were not seen, it felt that there was no need for billing. I still want to know, and I'm sure you would, if you're lucky enough to see Show People. It's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this movie so much and considered it a personal favorite. She looks at home in this movie, and her real life lacks sensation shines through in her performance, making it a great audience experience.
