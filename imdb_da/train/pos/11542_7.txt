The first time I saw this, I didn't laugh too much. At that time, I was only about fifteen years old and thought that perhaps some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at that time. I had the same reaction when I watched it a couple of months ago, and this time it was because Felix's interrupted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit. This scene made some of the things that Oscar said and did to Felix later in the movie, seems unnecessarily cruel, and their personality waves were not as entertaining as they could have been. Had I not already known the story, I would have worried that some of Oscar's antics to Felix could push him over the edge. As it was, it didn't make me laugh or smile as the TV show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did. All in all, a pretty good movie, and it created one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10
