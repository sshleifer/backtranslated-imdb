Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress, and now she is a very important director and author. She has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as an instructor whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensitivity to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. "Rosenstrasse", which has received mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect movie. It's a fine movie and evidence of a rare fusion of successful contradiction to the genocide Nazi regime of all peoples, generic powerless Germans, demonstrating in a Berlin street. <br /> <br /> Co-author von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident for a young woman's search for information about her mother never revealed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. Ruth Weinstein's husband (Jutta Lampe) is dead and in a surprising repentance to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently long ago, Ruth not only puts the "shivah" (the weekly weekly ritual of the Jews), but she insists on following the high creeds of his faith . Her New York apartment reflects the prosperity of her deceased spouse's work. Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a little discouraged by the mother's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practice, but they enter. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis may well break out when Ruth warns that she will reject Hannah if she doesn't give up with doting, beautiful Luis. Stay tuned. <br /> <br /> A cousin is going to pay her respect and also release traces of an interested Hannah about a mystery of secrecy about the mothers childhood in Berlin. Hannah is fascinated - she asks her mother who decisively refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time, and I knew many children whose families, in whole or in part, escaped from the Holocaust. These days were simply not discussed. <br /> <br /> So, after learning that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, Hannah pushes him to Berlin and hopes to find the Savior who is still breathing. If she wasn't, it would have been a very short film. But Ruth, who pretends to be a historian, locates the 90-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now widowed. As the happy to be interviewed, but shaken by repressed memories, Lena tells her story, the scenes shift pretty smoothly between today's Berlin and war capital. The young Lena from 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the Nazi regime, he was obliged to use "Israel" as a middle name, just as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (moreover, I wish IMDb had not provided Fabian's name on his sign list with the false "Israel" included - it upholds simply a name used by Nazis as a mark for classification and degradation). <br /> <br /> While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, they were married to "Arians" except. For a while. Until 1943, when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority was Jewish women married to non-Jews). Rundup is shown here in all its scary intensity. <br /> <br /> The young Lena is trying to find her husband. All she and many other women know is that they are limited in a building on Rosenstrasse. The amount of anxious women builds, some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse help and also verbally abusing them ("Jew-loving whore" is an appellation). As a subplot, Lena more or less adopts an eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember Ruth is now sitting on Shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is brought out by Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Finally, angry protests finally win the women. The men and a handful of women are released. As in the real story that the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the horrendously acknowledged defeats of their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to free the kingdom of mental defects and chronic invalids, but that is another story. <br /> <br /> Von Trotta builds up the excitement and every woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to produce the aging Lena, who slowly, one collector, begins to suspect that she is not dealing with a regular historian, but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she saved, the baby whose mother became murdered. <br /> <br /> The contrasts between Rosenstrasse from 1943, a set and the street today in a busy, rebuilt, united Berlin provide a recurring theme element. Today's Berlin bears heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta does it very well. <br /> <br /> The main players are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband, while strong, is also shown to be totally helpless in blocking confinement with a probable expulsion statement (as has been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-off trip to oblivion). Elder Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons who have long been suppressed in their happy New York life. Hannah is very trustworthy as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (though the Times critic doesn't seem to know it). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is safe but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels on a soiree enjoying Lena's violin game is unnecessary and distracting. The suggestion that she could go to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical supreme Hitler worshiper, to save her husband, detracts from the wonderful performance of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most German officers come from central castings and are cast by Erich von Stroheim's "copy and paste" school of teutonic nastiness. But it is understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles, and some argue that it is a paradigm case to claim that many more Jews could have been saved if several Germans protested. Unfortunately, this argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were placed on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. Therefore, the Rosenstrasse protest was almost unique. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices to the actual killers, it just cannot be denied that pre-Nazi endemic antisemitism erupted in a virulent strain from 1933. <br /> <br / > Elder Lena notes that what was achieved by the women was "a ray of light" in an evil time. Most of the men and women jumping from a near death journey survived the war. So "a ray of light" was that, and von Trotta's film is a light signal that shows that some were saved by the courage of virtually ordinary women, and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always want. <br /> <br /> 9/10
