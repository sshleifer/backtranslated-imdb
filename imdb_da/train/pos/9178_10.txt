I really have to say this was always a favorite of mine when I went to see my grandmother. And that's still the case. It is very, very close to the book. The way it is filmed and the players were just all good! I must recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but it was truly amazing! I gave it 10/10.
