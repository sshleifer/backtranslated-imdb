BEFORE DEVIL, YOU WILL BE DEATHED, start promising, create a simple heist that goes wrong, told by different perspectives (in RASHOMON style). At around the hour market, Sidney Lumet turns this movie into something so much more than the sum of its parts; It finally paints itself into a diverse family drama that explores the full range of human emotions / relationships as history comes to its chilling climax. As is the case with Lumet, he manages to coax unique performances out of his cast cast, without any overbearing or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman is in one of his best roles a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarfs Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. That is not to say that Hawke is not bad; In fact, he is right over enough, in a troubled role to suit his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she wears her meat adds this). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most exciting, and I think he deserved a bit more screen time. Amy Ryan also does her job adequately. <br /> <br /> BEFORE DEVIL KNOWS THAT IS DEAD, it's not an unusual movie, but it turns out that Lumet is still close to the top of his game on the (apparently) twilight of a brilliant career. Many of his characteristics and trademarks occur here, not least involving the use of his characters. Infused with a killed script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score, BEFORE DEVIL KNOWS THAT IS DEAD, is a must-see. A truly understated gem. 8.10. 3 stars (out of 4). Just enter my Top 250 of 248. Recommended.
