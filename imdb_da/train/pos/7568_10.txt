So it was my last day at the festival, and was glad I was stuck in that extra couple of days. Poetic, moving and most surprisingly fun, in his own strange way. It is so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world without appearing to be valuable or disturbing the balance. Managed to work both improvised, yet fully controlled. I hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influence (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern instructors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay , David Gordon Greene) You're in for a real treat. This is a wonderful movie and I hope more people will see it. If this movie plays at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
