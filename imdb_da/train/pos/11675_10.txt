I always follow Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' DVD home, I couldn't wait to see it! Of course we had seen the broadcast of the race while the current race was on, but it never gives the background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Long Way Round then you will not be surprised by the language that honestly I find more entertaining than offensive. I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he had styled it before Dakar, so my feminine need for cleanliness was attacked; tho 'I could have lived without the' flame 'undies lol As with the LWR, the preparation was just as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand and waved at every blue mark he maintained during the training .... and of course Andy Caldicot's death ... it was a terrible tragedy, but then there is something every year. <br /> <br /> Russ drives me nuts even though his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in LWR. It's great to see him come so well with Charlie. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was - 1. Never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything! - they had several months to prepare for the X5, and still the day before the team went to Lisbon, Scorpion had only made half of the things to do and the vehicle was a pain throughout the race; 2. The Dakar organizers have to put much more effort into their equestrian / driver management plan - leaving Matt (and probably a large number of other riders / drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing less than guilty of negligence; 3. Charlie has an enthusiastic enthusiasm for "hard and hard" adventures, but needs to train a lot to really do what he wants, and finally 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these epics called Long Way Down in 2007, and I can't wait to get my hands on it !: D If you love bikes and / or really nice blokes 'have a go', see this, I guarantee you love it. very entertaining. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, to Simon Pavey - you are the gentleman, I was so impressed with the "quiet priest" way and the fact that you are actually done ..... just incredibly contemplating, what a monumentally difficult race it is, and to Charlie, Matt and the rest of hol it - full marks to pull it away. Believing that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is really admirable. You are absolutely wonderful.
