One of the most nihilistic and brutal movies I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving. This is an action melodrama that the world has never seen before. Sometimes the plot got me close to tears, while in the next moment, shocking revelations deliver like a beating blow to the intestines. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK Cop and a Cambodian killer chasing each other down while gradually losing their humanity is a strong one. With a very small dialogue in favor of haunting images and gritty camera work, "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK-Bloodshed without the hero.
