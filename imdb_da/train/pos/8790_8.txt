Hilarious movie. I watched this movie at the 2002 Gay Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival, and laughed from start to finish. The action was subtle but very fun. I'm not quite sure "The Real World" influence, we don't get it here, but the movie stops without the understanding of that show. Heather B steals every scene she looks like, especially when acting with her rarely talkative red co-star. Highly recommended. I would like to see this published on Video / DVD some time in the future.
