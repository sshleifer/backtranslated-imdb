This is one of the most amazing movies I've seen in recent times. Go far beyond any international film of any mention. I'm really surprised why this didn't get the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni wins the National Award is perhaps the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar simply astounds as she speaks volumes through the eyes. There are a few scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city at Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notes a change in Gauri, but there is no single dialogue line. The whole spectrum of emotions is conveyed through subtle ways and eyes. There is another towards the end when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you are not moved by that scene, you do not have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie for pure filmmaking and acting.
