This is what I call a good movie. It lives through the amazing acting skills and a simple but human story. There are real signs that can be fun and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, just as living is. The bus driver and his son gather people through the country (Yugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrade. The fun and cruel situations that occur along the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together. <br /> <br /> See it and you'll remember it for life ... it's full of Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> And another reason for its magic: it's hard to get !!
