This Belgian movie, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known group dEUS, will not be favored by anyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even a plot. This movie shows only 24 hours in "a city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to see and really enjoy the dialogues, the management, the humorous (Dario!, The Osteopath Bruno!, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin , ...) signs. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS tab, Windman visiting the osteopath, ... <br /> It was clear that other viewers did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no history, etc. But it is the atmosphere that keeps you going and it will pull you into it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary like Tom Barman and his group dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mouth shut." (don't tell anyone)
