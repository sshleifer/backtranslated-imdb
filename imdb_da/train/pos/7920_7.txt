Full Moon High (1981) 3 out of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average regular high school guy. Preparing for the great homecoming game, girlfriend problems and growing hair in strange places ?? You know the usual. But the hair in strange places gets a little out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs. Now doomed to go the world forever young as a werewolf, how will Adam get any girls? <br /> <br /> 'Full Moon High' is not often spoken, but it is a silly and entertaining horror poof. Larry Cohen (Q The Winged Serpent, The Stuff) incorporates as many gags as he possibly can include as an author / instructor. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows good timing in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies', I think you will have fun with this chuckle party.
