This documentary was very thorough and exposed, and at the same time entertaining, which I thought was quite impressive. I felt they were doing a very good job covering the sport from its origins until the present day, but it is still a reason why I do not give so much point to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'real name' of the sport, so far as to say: too much on individual places to surf and especially too much on individual surfers. I felt that the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of sport, etc. It would have been better (although of course it was covered, I don't think it was as much time as it was justified). <br /> <br /> And for many people who don't have to surf, it can often be tedious to hear that they continue on and about certain places and particular surfers. Although video clips and in-depth research are respected, it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br /> Also, my biggest disappointment at times was they talked about how amazing and miraculous certain events in the surfing story were, but they didn't have the actual recording of those events unfolding, and constantly waiting for you on the silver screen To see this amazing, breathtaking event that these men are talking about as life-changing moments, and ultimately everything you get, many men are talking about it, not the footage itself. It was far too tantalizing for me to hear these stories and then couldn't see them. I understand the difficulty of getting recordings of everything, but please: Don't scold an event so much and don't show it. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very fresh documentary that I enjoyed not seeing the best documentary because of the above reasons but is very fresh and has some very exciting images and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that I would advise everyone to check out.
