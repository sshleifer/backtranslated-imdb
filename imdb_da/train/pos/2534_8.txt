Scientist working freak in seclusion finds a way to locate the crater by a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) science and breakthrough technology lectures of the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity could cure disease if properly utilized. When he summons his rivals - who had thrown him out of the scientific community and scoffed at him - to witness his discovery, they propose a "common" expedition to Africa ... of course, they end up stealing much from Dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. In addition, a lonely stranger who looks like a supportive comedy actor from the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally dr. Rukh's young trophy wife (Drake) who falls head over heels to scrap a human. Having grown horns like a deer would not do dr. Rukh (Karloff) any friendlier, so he begins in an undercover revenge mission ... kills 2 of his enemies and kind dr. The leg (Lugosi), the only one who had helped him ... eventually bowed to the deadly rays that had given him the opportunity to begin his vengeance at first, but (to my greatest dissatisfaction) sparse supremacy and the bad excuse for a man that she was married Action is mostly fine, with Karloff & Lugosi being very good. Check out the hysterical chambermaid scene ... Other signs are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, like all old universal horrors ...
