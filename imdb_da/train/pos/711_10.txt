"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebel party flick. Portraits a bunch of high school students using the Ramones music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic main role (Mary Woronov, "Eating Raoul" fame), the whole movie is one mile per minute. It's basically a big excuse to have fun and I'm sure you will. Bullied freshmen? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. Exploding Mouse? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these are the kinds of things that make life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know Ramone's music, it is pure pleasure. With how Roger Corman Executive produces and Joe Dante co-directs, how could we expect anything less? It's all too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into the ticket price as "Caddyshack II". <br/> <br /> Also with PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who has appeared in every one of Joe Dante's films and many of Roger Cormans), Don Steele, and of course Ramones . A real treat. <br /> <br /> * It seems that Bartel and Woronov are always involved. They were also co-stars in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the slasher girl "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... where they reprized their roles from "Eating Raoul".
