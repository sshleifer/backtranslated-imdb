The story confirms the classic image of good-to-evil in the form of a brother's fight against brother. The protagonist, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and justice. His brother, operating under the Dutchman Henry Brown's person, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage trainer who robs western crimes, followed by his brother for killing their father. The world story takes place is the classic dystopian west, where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter the city and the man responsible for keeping that law and order, is the classic western lawyer Wyat Earp. As well, such flat characters are typical of the Western, as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet-clad in distress. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this movie, the film's name, is a tailor-made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be considered an allegory for the rewards given to those who make things honorable. When it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to anyone who comes into contact with it. In that sense, the other resembles such icons as the Holy Grail of the Raiders of the Lost Ark and the blood-colored letter of the Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism, which is usually absent from Western, a genre that is not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a revenge movie, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit rape stamp in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the movie's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea, abducting a woman after killing her husband. The fleeting cowboy toy with budfoot man and sends him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting his head. Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what comes to him after he gets in touch with the vicious Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as was said in the Apollonius Argonautica. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some kind of intangible quality. As Jason jumps Stewart's character from an adventure to the next to find a unique prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 that resembles a mythical tale is the struggle between the brothers. Several antiquity stories deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible's story of Cain and Abel, and the vulgar number of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> With regard to the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as rape in Europe as Ovid tells in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a fine example of the Western genre and serves as an objective correlation for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.
