In my opinion, my left foot is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented writers and painters. The performances were smashing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, though I couldn't understand what he said most of the time. In addition, when he threw a tantrum, I was a little scared. It is also just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or as a biopics, I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented writers and painters. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so don't miss this one.
