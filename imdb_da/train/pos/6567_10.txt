Most (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who are not too critical or perhaps expected something else. This is one of my favorite films from the 80s, it grows on you and has it all. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it still doesn't disappoint, has lots of action, drama, romance and even comedy. In addition, the big car chases, automatic weapon shootouts and lots of things are blowing up and you have a fun, edge of your seat experience! You will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will both enjoy it a lot. The premise is that a paperback box hero, like Doc. Savage, really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here. The actor Jake Speed ​​is also director, producer and author of many films. In this movie, the Jake Speed ​​is an Indiana Jones adventure type, he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations, but will sometimes make brutal firepower (yay! And also silly luck!). Watch out for his high-tech equipment "James Bond", the ultimate road warrior SUV that goes out of the sky. Heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early Jim Carey vampire movie "Once Bitten" and here she is a little older and still a knockout even to her teenage blonde little sister. The evil ones are "real bad" men and are the worst low-key villain you love to hate. The end is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately never made - but you can just imagine what would happen next! <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie just because it will entertain and entertain you and it is worth the price of a ticket.
