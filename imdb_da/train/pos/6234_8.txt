This is my all-time favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. The dialogue between the two is so sweet and fun and very smart. Not to mention this movie contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; just as I put all my eggs in a basket and let's see music and dancing. If I remember correctly, it was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental crisis, but I'm a woman so get it over) All in This whole movie gets an 8/10 from me. The choreography was amazing and also the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even more amazing.
