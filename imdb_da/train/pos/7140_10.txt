20 out of 10 This is a truly wonderful story of a wartime evakuee and a curmudgeonly joiner Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is billeted with Tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious problems when he beats his bed on the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow they find comfort in each other's loneliness. It turns out that William has a talent as an artist, and we see Tom's talent as a crossmaster in a fun extradition of Jerusalem. William is befriended by Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish boy also from London and together with both Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and feel part of this tiny close society. Just as he sits down, William is recalled back to London by his mother, and this is where we see why he's so screwed up. His mother is apparently mentally ill, and when Tom does not hear from William, he travels to London to look for him. He finally finds him holding his dead baby sister, where he has been tied in a basement. After a period at the hospital, Tom realizes he must kidnap him and take him home with him. Climaxet is a bittersweet end when William is told he must be adopted by Tom while learning his best friend, Zacharias, in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom spoke to an official from the home office. <br /> <br /> I love 'im, a' for what it's worth, I also think he loves me '. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't get any better, does it?
