Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it is a fan-only series available on the internet, and it contains mainly friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home cameras and sewing machines that Mickey & Judy has once put on show a show. It is definitely friends and neighbors you can tell. Many of these people are not the most beautiful looks you've ever seen, or the youngest or the thinner ?? some of them stumble through their lines as they go on marble ?? some of them have thick accents or simply don't speak well at first, whick makes it almost impossible to understand a single lonely word as they say. Still, you have to admit, all that these friends and neighbors have put together is actually fun to see. Yes, part of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it is a bit strange (although it is also a bit cold) to look at two Starfleet men's kiss (though some of the kissing scenes seem to continue.) Yes, you cringe slightly when they clearly quote from ST: TOS, TNG, Other shows and movies or when you hear the theme from the Galaxy Quest game at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We can do it. Why? The graphics are first rate. Better than almost what you have seen. And sometimes a show or two really distinguishes history history? Some of them are actually real tears. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word ?? But you need to give the people involved credit where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to produce this size. People, sets, costumes, graphics ?? It is a great effort on many people's parts. We see we are returning and we thank them.
