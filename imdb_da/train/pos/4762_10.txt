I thought "The Souls River" was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with some extraordinary performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this was an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite standalone stories of the series. Personally, I've always preferred Scoggins to Christian, even though it's given JMS didn't write too much of the series to her, and she had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If you take smutty humor about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in these scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favorite of the four movies, but not at all bad.
