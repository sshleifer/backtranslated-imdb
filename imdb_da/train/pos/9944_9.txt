Well, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "big" movies these days are incredibly shocking or high budget / hyped somehow. Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who choose to pour their hearts into the tae kwon do. Whatever you expect from this movie, you are sure to feel moved by the work, pain, and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience. Although comedians are sometimes many beautiful and clever characters: There is the old guardian who takes too seriously, the hoodlum became good, who just wants a new chance in life, the wise substitute who would die happy if he won once in his life and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems - but most importantly, their own hopes and dreams. Although the drawing and objectives of the movie are simple, these aspects of the film merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and interpersonal struggles. <br /> In short, this movie will make you feel fresh, determined and content.
