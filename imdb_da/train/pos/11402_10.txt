I saw "An American in Paris" on his first release when I was still in school and fell in love with it immediately. I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count with the number of times I've seen it since, both in the cinema and on television. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and has the greatest men (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The offensive cast of Oscar Levant (as fun as ever), Georges Guetary (why didn't he make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The final ballet, super choreographed for the title music, makes excellent use of Paris' s sights and sounds and of images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on Seine's Shores) and "I Got Rhythm" (The Parents' Children participate in Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you love Paris, watch this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it. But see it!
