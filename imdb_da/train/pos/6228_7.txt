Another fun, witty, scary RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. Although it lacks the excellent melodies of SWNG TIME (although the final song "Face the music and dance" is one of the team's best and fair it), it is very fun as these two could hardly do anything wrong in the 1930s . Once again, the plot is easy and unforgettable, but seeing Fred and Ginger dancing together is pure heaven. These two transported more romance and magic into dance than many couples in movies do in a great love scene. While there is better peace and ginger musicals, this is definitely a must-see.
