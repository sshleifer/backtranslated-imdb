One of the most provocative films ever with excellent filmography supported by Mc Claren's lust and amazing quote "Do you believe in love at first site?". <br /> <br /> A trace of expressionism was evident in this image, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria clearly loved the movie and the role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered to mention it in her filmography. Laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie would undoubtedly be the heroic rescue of MC cleats as he rescued the young disabled child with the speech limitation. What I can add was to perfection! James Cahili's use of sound effects is unmatched even today. The drug breast, he performs early in the film, is pain unstable realistic. When I watched this movie for the first time, I was then forced into the intense lack of respect for the brothers Gang Inthused from the Southside gang and CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far one of the most encapsulated crevices Cahill has committed to filming. Personally, this movie has sentimental value to me and I want to download it in the near future. That's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
