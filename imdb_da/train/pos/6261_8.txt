Great documentary film from 1924. This early 20th century geography in today's Iraq was strong. See this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before making his ten commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that is probably dressed up during the recording of the remarkable landscapes of this film. Fans of Werner Herzog will find this movie to be a treasure, with heartbreaking tales of struggle, complimented by the earth around them, never having the human ability to endure so overtly. The fact that this was made, as it showed, not only shows the will of the subjects, but also the filmmakers themselves.
