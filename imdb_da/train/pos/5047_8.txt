Actor Paxton made his director debut with this chilling, dark and competent-made thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who calls his two sons to participate in savage assassination and claims that the victims are not humans at all but "demons" and that they have been chosen by God to destroy these "demons". This is all told in the flashback of one of the sons, now adult (Matthew McConaughey) to the skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to forget this movie automatically; Better than most serial killer functions, it is a rubbish and disturbing story that is told in the same way as a minimum of cinema gimmicks. Paxton, splendidly, hardly shows any blood at all at almost the end. Well done by all, especially the two children's actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary of "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I deducted any points whatsoever is because I understand that some people may find this difficult to stomach. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
