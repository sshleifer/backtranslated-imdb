Now this is what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural undertones, this lovely low-budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene. This shows that you don't need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie. The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually becomes more interesting as the film builds tensions to the final. Most of the actions we see through Carrer's eyes, which have just entered the prison and have to get used to living with these 3 other inmates. I won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more broadly viewed. However, there are some errors: FX is not as good, but they are used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; And things get very confusing at the end, but Malefique solves itself when it's over. I thought he was a very good movie, 8/10
