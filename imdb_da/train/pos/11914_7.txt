You know, this movie is not that big, but I think it is about angels that help a baseball team. I find the plot line to be fun anyway, says this child's father that he will take him back if the angels win the vimp (because he knows they don't want to). Kid prays to his false god to help the angels win, God helps all the time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And ultimately, his father does not take him back and drive on his motorcycle right in front of the children facing. It's fun until Danny Glover adopts it and it's a friend. I think the upright is that the old lady is back alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories. However, the right winner here is god. For later, he got a job as a writer for several prank shows. <br /> <br /> As a children's movie, it becomes a 7. As a movie about the mysteries of the blind, stupid beliefs and the character of "god," it becomes a 10.
