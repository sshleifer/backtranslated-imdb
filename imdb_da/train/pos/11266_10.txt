I have recently looked at this, but when it started, I had no idea what the concept was about what the subject was ..... in short - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary, it was a comedy routine ..... Now it was both. It started a little slow, but I think it's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was watching. But it sucked me in quickly. The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing facts and fiction in history. Mainly how we (Americans) learn history that is not really true - and how we learned what we did. He did it in such a way that the viewer was completely entertained and interested. I've actually learned a few things and it's a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this being downloaded as a series to HBO. I think it can be just as fun and effective with a number of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
