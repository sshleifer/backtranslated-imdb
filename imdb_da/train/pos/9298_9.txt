Simply, one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a parody of crime life, parody of everything that represents Chicago in 1930. - No one really needs to underestimate this movie because the rating is below 5. It's a meaning of a lot and the mass is hypnotized. Who chooses to see it - it will regret who decides not to see it - will regret more.
