Pinjar is a really good movie, with great plays, good story, good presentation, touching feelings, etc. It seems to me that the quality of the movies produced by Bollywood is improving these days, and this film is a proof. No Bollywood movie that I can remember made such an impact on me - I literally thought of the movie for hours - amazed at the various emotional situations that test the human being in a human. <br /> <br /> The movie rests on Urmilla Matondkar's great play, and also some from Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in the North India in the background of the partition, and all problems seem sweet if compared to the problems she experiences. <br /> <br /> And must-see movie. A technically superior Bollywood product that I feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world.
