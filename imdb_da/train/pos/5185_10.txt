I've seen this movie well over 100-200 times, and I love it every time I saw it. Yes, it can be very corny, but it is also very fun and fun. The camp shown in the movie is a real camp I actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as the camp really is a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever gone to camp, wanted to camp or sent a child to the camp should watch this movie because it will bring wonderful memories to you and your children.
