Class Reunion is a very understated comedy gem. It's 1982 and 1972 class Lizzie Borden High returning to the 10-year reunion, among them are the usual stereotypes, the hunk, the babe, the fat guy and the nerd, etc., But the previous students are out for a rough night, one of their classmates is Walter Baloer, the class club who was subjected to a comedy of the rest of the class on departure and since then been in a mental home, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humility ,,,, <br /> <br /> Despite the dark premise, this is really just an excuse for many very funny gags and put pieces. To say too much would ruin the movie, but if you have enjoyed the naked gun and flight movies, you will love this and what other movie offers a music como by Chuck Berry? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
