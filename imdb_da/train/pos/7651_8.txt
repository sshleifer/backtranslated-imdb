An interesting TV movie based on true fact, betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters, one captive. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate task of deciding whether he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem starts. It has nothing to do with Kotea's ability to function. He just resembles the version of a proletarian prison prisoner according to "G.Q." magazine with a language too sophisticated for a person who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after I had met an old friend again, whom I hadn't seen for nearly 15 years, as he used in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I used to know is gone, not just because he is older, but because of his longer exposure to the criminal system. There are prisons, and there are prisons you have to say, but one "Shot In the Heart" prisoner is certainly out of this world.
