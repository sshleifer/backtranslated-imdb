I was fortunate enough to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and was smeared so hard with what I saw that I returned the next night to his second of three screenings. A fun, wild and sharp attack on every aspect of the ordinary entertainment passively slipped in without the taste of the lowest-common audience targeted by a one-sided journalist who slowly took members to his guerrilla war on predictability is what the film is about and Performed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you are back after the credits roll with hope renewed and excited that original films can still be made. Anyone who is frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to brighten their performances would do well to hunt (and I mean hunting) this rare item. For fans of Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman movie, and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexing as a rabid dog.
