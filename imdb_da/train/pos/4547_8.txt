This could be a 10 if it wasn't for the completely predictable and Hollywood-ish scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of our leading players (why not the lead I ask) and the rest of the cast is at a very high level. I was personally impressed with Hugh O 'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The very first scene I saw on him was really strong. Wow.
