I have finally seen these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back and check continuously as they were actually produced. They are absolutely scary because they made room for fun of what would be the future. Neither Parker nor Stone lived in Texas and saw Gov Bush's idiot, or they are the weird people who are aware of things. Boo, scary! Bush's frat bros invade the white house dressed as Arab wielding rifles? Bush's accident 'does anyone? (No, wait. He did it as a gov.) It could have seemed like a scam at that time, but now it must be considered brilliant if it is scary.
