I saw this gem of a movie in Cannes where it was part of the directors two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of amazing. Fun all the way through, with all members of a strong casting working off their socks. It's a sometimes laughing comedy about a petty villain (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to jail. While in prison, does he meet with a "lifer" who tells him "the ultimate bellini"? which one for you and me ?? is a safe-fire get rich quick scheme. It turns out there is a road through a deserted building to the towns jeweler's shop ?? who could net millions. Sounds simple? ?? Throw in all kinds of crazy characters and events along the way and you've got the ingredients for a wild ride !! ?? words go from a low-living loser to the next, and soon a team of them gathers to try to get into Cosimo's "bellini" link of unsuccessful boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell en en en surely a star to do) and reluctant screamer Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby with him when his wife was locked up for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film, Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also inspired a similar movie to `Collinwood '?? `Palookaville '. This knocks spots of the latter effort, and although it is written and directed by the russo brothers, it certainly has shades of Coen Brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who have a small but hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker.
