This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some campy humor and death scenes that can be kind of comical. I liked the movie because of its off-beat humor. It's certainly not a super scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I liked the execution of the hillbilly guy and Lester ... very trustworthy. I think I will color my hair red like the scarecrow girl - very cool! Anyway, overall worth the rent for campy humor and not the typical horror experience.
