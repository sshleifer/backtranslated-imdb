Although you're not a big Ramones fan, Rock 'N' Roll High School is still * the biggest rock-n-roll movie ever made. Why? Because it is treated with respect in all camps, despised and abominable teenagers often (and rightly) appear to be the dull, stupid, fascist, established world of adults. The final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes for a movie I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen the honor of ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
