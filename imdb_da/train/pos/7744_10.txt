You have to watch a movie with good dialogues, good music, great plays and a great atmosphere. In the film you follow 8 people in a day in the city of Antwerp, they are all individuals and sometimes ordinary strange (that's how I love them!). <br /> <br /> I won't say anything else, just go and see and enjoy it.
