This movie came home for me. Being 29, I can remember the 80s and my dad working in a factory. I figured that if I worked hard too, if I had pride and never gave up, I could also have the American dream, the house, a couple of kids, a car to call myself. However, I have noticed, without any degree in anything (unlike my father who finished in ninth grade) and an avid sense of greed and laziness, you can't get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It's made for TV, and I saw it an hour ago. I don't find it anywhere! I want to show it to my friends, my pseudo-friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that Americans would work for honesty and that we were proud of what we did !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made abroad ...
