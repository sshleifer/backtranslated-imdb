I really loved this movie, yes, I know it was pretty far taken. There is no way that the Shelby car could have been on the road as well as the 540i with all the traction control and other gizmos, but apart from the whole movie was well put together. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the throw was also pretty good with the exception of Brit Bad Guy, he was a little "too" much don't you think? Anyway, good movies, good cars and good actors. I made sure my car was locked and worried in my remote garage that night. :)
