I bought some movies on the disc, although the second-rate presentation was not an option. A particular company I don't want to identify here has put out several pan and scan DVDs ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80" and the one, to name just three!) Of movies, I don't think someone will look in this compromised format. Some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen, and others are just in their theatrical release 1.66: 1 ratio. <br /> <br /> What comes from my chest, I'd say "Deathtrap" was a creepy and strange enough, funny picture. My only complaints are tinny scores (what is the f____g instrument that is usually pulled out for film in the 18th century France?) And Dyan Cannon screams at regular intervals. Could her character not have been an asthmatic who grabbed an inhaler when she became stressed? Smaller complaints, both. The benefits of disks include being able to fast-forward rather than get over the things you don't like. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a staged version of "Deathtrap", so having those roles puts a good impression of their career at that time. Before Broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg, the theater was more affordable for average people. Now, anyone who pays less than a king's ransom to get live entertainment doesn't pay a hit show in the big hyped way. Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both large virile units in the early 80's, and it is embedded in how we respond to their profession and overall image here. They are certainly not bookish men who can't fight or come back from an obstacle. The two are just as big, as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate "death stop".
