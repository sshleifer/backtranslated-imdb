The most amazing, spiritually uplifting film about the restoration of the gospel. Far better than any other movie, or film made about the restoration so far. If you haven't seen it, hop on a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You will not regret it! You really get a sense of what the first Saints had to fight through and put complete and total faith in the Prophet Joseph Smith. You finally get some sort of understanding of the things that the Prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people face. If you have questions about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, just watch this movie, it will make complete and total meaning afterwards.
