I had seen this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') one night ago at www.afrovideo.org, and I didn't see anything racist (I'm not stupid), I admit that the sign design is a little raw and unsatisfactory today, but I think it is a satire and a very, very urban tale of the old Uncle Remus stories that the black American culture created right down to the protagonists and the blatant nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch." These are not confused stories, remember you, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I am a white woman reading and loving these stories. And I also found it an interesting hour-capsule view of the black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Now to get to the nitty-gritty of this movie: This movie is a live action / animated movie that begins in live action with a guy named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone), to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but stopped by a roadblock and quit in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy involuntarily listens to colleague Escapee Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young newcomer to the metropolis, who quickly rises from obscurity to rule throughout Harlem; You know, rabbit, bear and reef are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and vivid action footage, the movie is a graphic and judgmental satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s ?? racist, ethnic and otherwise. <br /> <br /> Yet, it's another good Bakshi movie; and should we sweep movies like this under the blanket? pretended to never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should watch these movies, and we learn about what's going on, just how far we've been since then.
