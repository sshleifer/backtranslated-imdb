I've seen this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's so much fun. And it's pretty scary, but all in good, ghoulish fun. A woman kills her other man but runs into a problem when a fleeting lunatic in a ragged Santa Claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl for a moment at the moment. Mary Traynor, whom I like to remember from SNL or any other TV comedy play, is the evil wife, and Larry Drake plays the lunatic in the shivering Santa Claus suit. I had forgotten Santa was played by Drake over the years. His Santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times. You might guess how santa finally comes into the house. The section is played by laughs, but it can also be quite intense at times.
