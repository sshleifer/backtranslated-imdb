After watching this movie months ago, it continues to bounce back into my consciousness, and I feel I have to buy it or at least watch it again, even though I saw it at least 3 times when I rented it that time. <br /> <I fell in love with Hal Hartley's instructions many years ago - I found out that these movies could make me laugh at a place that is rarely entertained. It is a strange feeling that is given, and I suppose most people out there really do not understand it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I think I just really get it - it's like these movies was made for me. <br /> <br /> Although I don't remember if I actually laughed a lot at this movie, it is still one of the funniest movies I've seen for many years. If you don't see humor in the shopping bag, Fay wears from the street to a church, to the brother's publishing office, to her son's headquarters, you may lack the intelligence to be very impressed with this movie. The bag is a silent character in itself that is drawn around as an icon of motherhood, the normal brash, bitchy Parker Posey must wear before the international intrigue of the rest of the film occupies her. <br /> <br /> I'm considering "Henry Fool" my least favorite of Hartley's movies. I honestly can't remember it very well - I think the sign itself was so contemptible, I found it boring. Hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development. <br /> <br /> Aside from Posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses again. Her extravagant naivety is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make it monstrous to seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout. <br /> <br /> This movie breaks into a very relevant international intrigue story that explains political situations in Afghanistan. This is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of the development of this film is unmatched. <br /> <br /> This is the epitome of a stand-alone successor. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more mystery spun around him, the less you expect his appearance towards the end of the movie - as an alcoholic chain-buying complaint machine that strikes persecution on its Islamic terrorist guards who somehow to respect him. Although I was impressed and pleased with Hartley's second latest movie "The Girl from Monday" and "No Such Thing", "Fay Grim" goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality no Oscar ever wins would dare.
