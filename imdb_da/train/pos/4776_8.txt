I watched this movie at one of my usual times, which is really right late at night. Usually, if a movie doesn't interest me, I start to fall asleep and have to raid the fridge to be awake. <br /> <br /> First, I thought that was what I was supposed to do when this movie's pacing started slowly, along with the fact that its shot tends to be similar to the character for a long time. But eventually I start to get more into the movie, as more is revealed about the protagonist through his storytelling. In the end, you feel you have known him all your life. The film kept my interest so much that I didn't even know the sun was rising. <br /> <br /> Not much of Lynch's bizzare style, but there are plenty of crooked characters to make the movie entertaining.
