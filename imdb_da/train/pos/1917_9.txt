This was a wonderfully fun comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly cast as parents, and the kids were also good. Kaley Cuoco was a great choice to play Bridget, a tinted version of Kelly Bundy from Gift with Children. The printer and performances were both top notch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died in the series, and it put a damper on things. They had to scramble to change the show and involve more cast members, and that was of course an unpleasant situation, but they handled it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have lasted longer if Ritter lived. <br /> <br /> I especially loved it when they brought Ed O'Neill in a guesthouse. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
