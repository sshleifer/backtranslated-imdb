A unique movie ... one of the best of all times. Acting, scripting, Quincy Jones' scores, filmography, editing, etc. - just amazing. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (Clutters) of a couple of young guys during a mistaken robbery. I have never seen a movie that so brilliantly transformed a true story into a key movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killings of Dick and Perry and the law enforcement team pursues them. Scott Wilson, who Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy and devoid of compassion, he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is also extraordinary - lonely, and immediately empathetic and cold blood. Who could fold these properties into an individual and get us to buy it? He does it and it is brilliant! A key point in the book is how it took the intersection of these two very different sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and violent crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these notions are high watermarks and it stands for admission period. <br /> <br /> Police are also wonderful. Leading research is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also good. Unlike contemporary films, where manufacturers feel it necessary to provide police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just real flatfeet that make the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I have never seen the police on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; And I've seen most of the crimes classics go far back. Really one of a kind in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie is unique because you already know what happened, but I warn about the post). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the best criminal shows and movies are interrogated - the intellectual fences match between police and villains Mano a Mano. This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever watch movies. See Dick and Perry try to bluff through and slowly race, unaware that the police have the goods on them. But the police should just prepare their suspects to break their alibi and hopefully induce confessions. These are some of the best plays you will ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was admitted to the actual Clutter House, and I've heard Clutters being played by movie students to give them a true feel. It works. These seem like decent, simple folk music. That makes crime so tangible and sad. <br /> <br /> I stop here. It's not an emotion-good movie, but it's one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it is mandatory to watch every movie.
