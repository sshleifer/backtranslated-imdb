This episode is a bit confusing. Some say you should start from the beginning, but I must say I was a little confused from the beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark gets a blow in the head and wakes up on the floor of the Fairview Mental Institution and has fun believing he's superhero. Clark is told that life he knew was all in his head. Delusions. He also finds some things that are unusual: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; and Lana is devoted to Clark. But he finds a familiarity; Another one devoted to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that a mental patient is also from Littleville's well-known world. And the doctor is a refugee from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me straight back to a Buffy episode called "Normal Again", where Buffy begins to have live daydreaming about a mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that all she knew was a fantasy of her imagination and that she was actually wild. Her parents were still married, they still lived in LA, her friends didn't exist, Angel was never his girlfriend, and she didn't have a sister called Dawn. Demons and vampires did not exist either. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors not only tell the characters that it is all a fantasy of her imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and that brings us back to reality. However, it is great to have a sense of reality every now and then, but we see these shows escape from reality. Again, it is great because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
