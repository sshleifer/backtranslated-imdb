No movie has caught my attention as this one has. You see, I wanted to watch this movie again for over 25 years. The only time I saw it was like a teenager who might have been the year it was released, 1977. What I remember about the movie is that it affected the deep emotions so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to see it again. Understanding this film gives of the human element of father / son seeking and seeking is sure to touch any human soul who sees it. Why this movie has not been stored and shown as often as many other films with less depth, I do not know. Postcript: Received a copy of the movie and after seeing it again it was gratifying to see that my memory was true. Assessment reflects film content. Want to watch this movie on DVD, as this product in 1977 on a used VHS tape took away from the overall quality.
