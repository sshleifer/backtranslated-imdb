In April 1965, CBS published the first of Barbra Streisand's monumental television offerings. The show was not only a successful success, but also got 5 Emmy awards. This is one of the most memorable moments in the 1960s television and (unfortunately) the kind of television special they no longer produce. Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance of Barbra, this special is a must for any Streisand fan and anyone interested in early television.
