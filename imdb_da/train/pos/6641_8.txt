On December 28, 1895, in Grand Café in Paris, film history wrote itself, while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all single shots, to a paying audience. 'La Sortie des Usines Lumière' was the first film to be played, and I wish I was there not only to watch the movie but also the audience's reactions. We start with closed doors of the Lumiere factory. Apparently, when the picture looks like a photograph, people thought they should just see a slide show, not something they had hoped for. But then the doors open and people pour out and go home. First, many women saw some men and a man on a bicycle with a large dog. When they are out, the doors close again. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the first movie or not (some say 'L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat' was the first movie Lumière recorded) is an impressive piece of early cinema. Being sad this is almost impossible for several reasons. A simple reason: It's only 50 seconds long. But also for people who usually only like the special effect films, there must be something interesting here; You don't see historical things like this every day.
