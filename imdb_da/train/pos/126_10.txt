Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen this year. If you like unique thrillers who are influenced by film noir, then this is just the right cure for all the Hollywood summer blossoms that clog the theaters these days. Von Trier's follow-up as Breaking the Waves has received more recognition, but this is really his best work. It is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of excitement and dark humor. It's too bad that he decided that handheld cameras were the wave of the future. It is hard to say who spoke him away from the style he is showing here, but it is everyone's loss that he went into his highly theoretical dogma direction instead.
