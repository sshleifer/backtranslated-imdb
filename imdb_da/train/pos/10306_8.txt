As a person living near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored with me before I even saw it as history is based here. There are even some parts with real news TV anchor people from Buffalo .. and for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still made to see and think like humans ... and of course be a little on the liberal side. Being the lightweight comedy is it, nothing should win any prizes, but it is still entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laughing slapstick comedy scenes, and hopefully the audience - from Christians to atheists. - has something out of this besides a few laughs, such as prayer should really be about. Kudos to the authors at least to get this theology correct and give a good message. All in all, it is a kindhearted movie that should offend very few.
