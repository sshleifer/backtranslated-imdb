"The Thing About My Folks" came in as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, based on a play by one of his stars, Paul Reiser, proved to be a pleasant time in the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the result, it is a journey of discovery, where Ben learns to know his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is and not the mythical figure he has in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be a vehicle for its star, Peter Falk, and he runs away with the movie as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most avid actors working in films in this era and in the past years, is an actor of such size that he must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman, the distant father of Ben, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not only by Ben, but it appears from the whole family and his wife for thirty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, Kleinman's clan's matriarch runs away, everyone is panicking because this woman, who has been the strong figure of the family, is crucial to keeping everyone together. Without knowing where she has gone, Sam shows up in Ben's house confused as he feels abandoned, suddenly by the woman, he married and has been faithful all these years. Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of Manhattan into the country. The trip excuses Ben's commitment to his father in ways he never knew because the old man had always projected a secluded figure to his younger son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. Sam's love for Muriel spans the many years they've known each other; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the movie. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes his life is changing to the worst. Mr. Falk shines like the older man, and there is never a false movement in his interpretation of the man if the whole world crumbles under him. <br /> <br /> Not being a Paul Reiser fan, we have to admit it as Ben Kleinman he is right. Ben and his father discover how much they both have and their love for Muriel, the mother who has sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is seen only at the end of the movie. She makes a good contribution as the fugitive mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful look thanks to Dan Gillham's filmography and the outstanding musical score of Steven Argila. In the end, the film shows a huge team effort between its director, DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it to the screen. Although this film is clearly targeted to an older audience, it should please anyone.
