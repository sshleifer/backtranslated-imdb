I totally disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the film is based on the book, and if the author had a homosexual character in it, how could "Hollywood" just throw in a token-gay character in the movie. And besides, there were two gay characters, and I thought they reflected each other well. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a great performance, and if the other reviewer had a decency to watch the whole movie, they would have seen her character evolve through the movie by interacting with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara crashed into the junkyard, you could see that the material side of her came out, and later in the movie you also saw that she was also invincible. But I think if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. But if you are more open-minded and I don't know, you have some of the things that are good, so you will enjoy this movie.
