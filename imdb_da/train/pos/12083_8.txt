Second, concerns a young woman in London who is desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretary positions with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people kept in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy - I end up feeling like a prisoner - but this rather classic B movie is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. It's far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (like "Dead of Winter") proved not to be wise as the plot elements are not modern. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short in 65 minutes!), But it keeps the course neat until a hasty climax, which feels a little sloppy. *** from ****
