Wonderful movie, one of the best horror movies in the 70s. She is realistic and atmospheric. As usual, it was inevitably the usual negative comments. I have noticed that most horror movies over a certain period of time often fail to achieve self-sufficiency. Of course, because most horror movies are old and must be denigration, is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the possibility of music critics here. Before reading the review, you already knew what was the final judgment. In the movie is a good gift because 10 really really good. Raines reads pretty well, and the film as a way it was produced reminds me of a lot of Kubrick movies. He really impresses. Excellent movie really. I consider a movie anthology in the 1970s.
