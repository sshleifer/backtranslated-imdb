"The first war must be 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a hard to describe movie; comedy, satire, action, screwball. It reminded once or twice of Dr. Strangelove, especially in scenes with Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job I think). I had no special expectations for this movie, even though I'm a big John Cusack fan, so I just let the movie wash over me. And as a result, I was totally entertained. The political satire is painfully accurate and quite judgmental by the US military business complex. The subplotters were a little predictable, but the final interweaving of history lines made them all worthy. I can understand why this movie wasn't very popular in the United States, but for the rest of the world it's a timely story.
