I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, lovely and very colorful. You can see that MGM was showing Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this movie. Each scene is packed full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a marvel. He is so talented. The dances in this movie are all perfectly done and perfectly designed. He understands that the dancers can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the movie, the great dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this movie very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have had a better gift for tune. I enjoy very much Gershwin's music. It is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is certainly one of the greatest lyrical writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a very entertaining movie.
