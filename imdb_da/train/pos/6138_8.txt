This is an old-fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with probably the most appealing beginner witch ever. Unlike many modern stories that seem to revel in dark witchcraft, it is simply a magical story of hocus pocus that is sweet, light hearted and charming. The story is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are evacuated out of danger from World War II war. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the child's trio use a magical bedknob to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent rector of Miss Price's witch education correspondence school. Miss Price sets out to work with magic designed to bring lifeless things to life. Meanwhile, they also have to deal with a shady character called Bookman and his contributors, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Of course, Angela Lansbury is wonderfully loving as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, head of the late witchcraft school, has now become street magician. This actor was previously run as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a story reminiscent of the former Mary Poppins, both fantastic fantasy stories for children. Maybe this movie doesn't have quite as memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it boasts some appealing little tunes. Some have been critical, but the film has excellent special effects. All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. It's a shame if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely and enchanting tale that should appeal to the child in all of us.
