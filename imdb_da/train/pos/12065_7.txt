"Insignificance" is far from big movie, from a stage play directed by Nic Roeg. In the plan with Roeg's film, this is above the level of most of his post-"Not See Now" work, which is characterized by a skilled use of Theresa Russell as the lead role. She is actually very good here, and far from the problem in other Roeg films such as "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As the "actress" who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective and shows her as a thoroughly depressive but sympathetic siren. She plays well with Michael Emil as Einstein, who is extremely excellent to say the least. He sees that part admirably, and while Theresa Russell doesn't look like Monroe, she is certainly attractive enough to make that part ring true. Other players are appropriate if they are not as arresting as Emil and Russell. A beautifully functioning, intelligent script is well-tended by Roeg, but certainly not brilliant, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other later Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague, unnoticed flashbacks that add very little to the movie. In many ways, the movie would have worked better as a shorter (say 60 minutes), more modest piece. Still a pretty acceptable, passable movie. Sometimes quite excellent, but something is missing overall. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
