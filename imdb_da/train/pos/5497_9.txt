A remarkable piece of documentary that gives a vivid picture of a country that is deeply divided in itself (for further evidence, see some of the comments on IMDb ...!). Compares extremely positively with Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is essentially an in-depth study of Fidel Castro's nostril hair). I don't know if Chavez is all he presents himself as one, or another in the long line of populist Latin American "caudillos". I also do not know if he will be able to cope with the great expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect a movie like this to answer such questions - but I certainly have a really good idea of ​​what is at stake and what it feels like to be caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the film "We make history", and that is exactly what the film feels like it is capturing. Outstanding things.
