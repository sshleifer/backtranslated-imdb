I've bought, "All Saints' Party" and it's not really a horrible movie, but many things could have been better. It had a great historical value, played by very talented actresses / actors, and it is not an everyday occurrence that actors can play such a role and make it something credible. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I didn't want to say that the whole movie was horrible. Thinking about it, capturing 1800's New Orleans, and doing something about it, it's pretty hard and much harder to get actors who can strongly describe these parts. But the only major problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who played the free color people were mostly light-skinned Africans, not very universal by casting others who were not light-skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Who had the casting could have chosen a wider variety when it comes to shade, despite the fact that many creoles are color conscious. Instead of choosing actors who looked almost white in a way, it could have become more thoughtful. The actors did a good job, the manuscript could have written better, and generally I found the performances were very credible.
