This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none. I love how Stanley just dumps the women into the lake. I've been a fan of Judd Nelson's many years of work and he blew me away. It's a mix of horror and drama and romance, not so much comedy. His evil, yet charming appearance caught me so and then. It looks in his eyes I will never forget. There is something about him that I cannot describe.
