I have read through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users are stuck in a "realistic" type of mentality. This movie was supposed to be a "fantasy" .... a "what if" funny movie. It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out - though it shaded the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 at the time and enjoyed it altogether - my young son loved it too! Later I shared it with my daughter and she loved it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should be enjoyed for the same time - fun. All the "realists" in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoiding any other kind of film. So sorry the young people who saw this movie first and then could go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in the Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have expected to find the same type of environment portrayed in the movie and so felt 'letdown' ... I suppose their parents did not explain the difference between imagination and reality. Oh good. If you love fantasy-fun movies and haven't seen this, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
