This is a really great card from Hal Roach. This is due to two main reasons: The smallest children in cards are among the sweetest ever to have been on film, and the plot has so many fun and well-written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the smallest of Little Rascals, I honestly can't think of a better child than Spanky about four years old. Despite being a pretty stubborn and unattractive kid in recent years, he was just valuable here. And it was not only fun to place the little little boy who was responsible for keeping the kids himself, even though it was fun, but once again high on the sweet factor. Following the older children's challenges Spanky to do this horrible babysitting job, all sorts of fun chaos go loose. The gags are pretty efficient and well-arranged on time - with an accidental turnaround involving a murder and a last scene, where Spanky finally gets control over the little ones who are most memorable. I haven't seen these shorts for decades, and I'm glad I gave this one a try.
