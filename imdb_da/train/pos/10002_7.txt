This is easily the most underrated movie inn in the Brooks cannon. Sure, its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or the Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians you identify). Many of the jokes fall flat. But this movie is still very lovable in the way many comedies are not and pulling it in a story about some of the most traditionally counterfeit members of society is truly impressive. It's not Fisher King, but it's not bad either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have thrown another in the lead (I love Mel as director and author, not as much as a management).
