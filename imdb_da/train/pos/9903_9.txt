Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now. Kind of loud, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I don't want to drill you with a plot pick, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, because you know all that is happening. That's why you're here anyway. What I want to do, however, is to explain the good memory I have of this quintessential 80's D-Movie slasher joint. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my dad used to rent all those horror movies. Would he take care that his children looked at them with him? No. So at the young age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie stuck with me a great deal of time. I haven't seen it since, but I remember today that most of the ridiculous kills in the movie. For example, post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) Is electrocuted. Or the guy is drowned in a cess pool. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... the exploding stomach of the tasted beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school like 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? So does his stomach explode? What!? And the big line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic crap all the way. <br /> <br /> I think I'm looking back now, almost 20 years later, and laughing at it. But when I was 7, I was afraid of it! It jester hat (or was it a mask?) That killer rocks throughout freaked me f * ck out! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a crappy movie. But for nostalgia and for humor factor, this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me. Either flare every night really late and hope to catch this on the same Late Late Late show or chase a VHS copy and dust off your VCR.
