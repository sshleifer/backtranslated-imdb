I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I did not want and have always been a sucker for a good haunted story (especially for such wonderful images as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill" so I had the feeling that "Blood Castle" would be right up for my alley. And boy, was it ever! This French-Italian co-production, while perhaps not the classic, Steele's first horror film, "Black Sunday," remains today is an extremely atmospheric, chilling entry into the ghost genre. Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a true scary miasma. The film is about a journalist asking a Lord Blackwood and a writer named Edgar Allen Poe to spend the night at Blackwood Castle on All Saints Day night when they killed in the castle restoring their destiny. The viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible, for the most part. In fact, the movie sends up tremors on the viewer's spine, and in the unknown DVD, which I just looked at - thanks to the fine people at Synapse - there is even a surprising topless scene and a bit of a mild lesbian! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; Her other world art is of great benefit to playing a sympathetic joke. Her mere presence transforms a spooky ghost story into something truly memorable. Not for nothing has she been called "The Queen of Horror".
