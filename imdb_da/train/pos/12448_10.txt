First time I am a dedicated fan of Modesty and have read the comics since I was a child and I have found the previous films about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they fail, one ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, we go: Mrs Blaise works for a casino, a gang of robbers come together and she starts playing for her friends life. If the robber wins a round, she must tell him about herself. If she wins twice in a row, one of the employees goes free. (Sounds silly, yes, I'm not that good at explaining either.);) <br /> <br /> She tells him to grow up in a war zone without parents or friends about her help to an old man in the refugee camp and how they evade, live by nature's own rules. They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they are caught up in a war, and when they are rebelled, they are shot at, and the old man dies, leaving her to meet the city itself. <br /> <br /> So she meets the man who is casino she is now working for and ending the story. <br /> <br /> What follows is that there is a fantastic match and the line is absolutely cool. Alexandra Town is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic. Feeling awkward, but also Modesty speaks with a slightly broken accent, but that is not relevant, as the comic can not speak loudly, but must certainly have a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention that it is strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans.) The action is really good, even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have an applause! <br /> <br /> My favorite part is where she tumbles her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass! Absolutely amazing! : D I can't wait for the right adventure to begin in the next movie / s! <br /> <br /> See, you won't be disappointed!
