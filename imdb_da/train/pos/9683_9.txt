Spoiler This is a great movie about a conure. He goes through the trial and tries to get back to his little girl owner. He learns a lot through his journey and meets many other beautiful birds. If you love birds that my wife does, this movie is for you. This movie also has some sad parts that make the tears run. Eventually everything seems to Paulie and his Russian friend. Rent this for the whole family, everyone will enjoy this.
