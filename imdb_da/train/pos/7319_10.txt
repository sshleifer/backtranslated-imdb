Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He solves his problems on his older sister, whom he murdered at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things coming from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows something is different about him, something mysterious evil. This evil will not be contained and it cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the problems of this misguided boy. But he seems to have trouble finishing his sister, as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still seeking the only girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been many of these horror films involving teens being hacked by a masked or cruel killer. But this one started it all, kind of. If you think about it, most of these horror movies we all remember are those that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing about half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, these characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloween's instructor John Carpenter got a lot out of the 50s and combined everything he knew into a movie that scared hell out of many people back in the late 70s. This movie solidified him as an instructor to watch and also jumped on the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl stalked by the masked murderer. <br /> <br /> This movie may seem clich√© today, but it wasn't much out there like this. It has been copied from and ripped off, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills that listen to Carpenter's exciting music as we see another victim being chased by the shady Michael Myers.
