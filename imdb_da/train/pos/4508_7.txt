I was impressed by the beautiful photograph of this movie shot on the spot in Alaska. Although we are technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities. Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloo, etc. And their customs as offering their wives to visitors are routinely in history. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage as it was easy to recognize some rear projections of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it sometimes as a documentary. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary taste. The filmmakers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by a person on the screen or by intertitles. The introduction said there were no actors in the film, except for the white merchants and the royal Canadian police, but it was not quite true. The two main characters played by Mala and Lotus Long were Eskimos at birth, but were professional actors with credits for previous films, and you could sometimes see that they had makeup on. But they were excellent in their roles and they continued to have Hollywood career. All in all, the film is definitely worth a visit.
