This is a fan-made short film pretending to be an example of a new movie that couples Batman and Superman! It's the kind of movie that fans love and watch in places like ComicCon and were made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, I could easily pick it apart. Sure the CGI effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT this was done on a shoestring budget and for a fan movie this is incredible. I was particularly impressed with the very nice Superman - he was no wimpy little guy! If this was just an example of a real movie, they had fans here up to Omaha to see it. Good work.
