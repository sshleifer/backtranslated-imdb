Now I am very happy to hear a rumor that this can finally be issued on DVD. When it's going to happen, I don't know, but I get it when it's released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining movie, especially when "gentleman Jim" Corbett's ring career begins in the movie. Then it goes from a good movie to a big one. <br /> <br /> Few people could play arrogant men and still come out as a good guy as well as Flynn could and this movie is a perfect example of it. It was reported that this was Flynn's favorite role, and I think so. You can just feel how much fun he had here. Ward Bond also looks like he really enjoys playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond was never better either. <br /> <br /> There are just the right amount of action box scenes here and they are also quite well done. Corbett's family is also fun to watch as they continue in the stands under Jim's matches. Out of the arena, Corbett's family can have constant arguments and shouting a little too loud and annoying, but they set the stage for a proper conclusion. <br /> <br /> And as for the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett says after the Great Fight is very touching and the highlight of the movie. Some transparent critics (Variety, for example) did not like the end or the fact that much of the film is fictionalized, but - duh - most movies are fictionalized, like it or not. And in this case it made a good story and a good ending. (In fact, Corbett was a very soft talking true gentleman, not something like Flyn's portrayal, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) This is one of the more entertaining classic movies I've ever seen and I'm eagerly waiting for DVD ' one.
