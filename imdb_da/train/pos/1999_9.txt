Oliver! the musical is my favorite. The music, the characters, the story. It all just seems perfect. In this rendition of the timeless classic novel, stage music, director Carol Reed Broadway's hit leads the movie screen. The transition from musical to film music is not easy. You need the right voices, the right set, the right script and the right game. All characters point to yes for this game. It seems that it was written for the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage. He wins his way through the country to London, where he meets a group of youth criminals, led by Dodger, the smart talking, fast-paced pickup pocket. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older guy selling all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But everything is not good in London when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy is intertwined with olives, bassin and his young troops and the law. What follows is a wonderful story of love, affection and good music. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, you listen to these tunes and you will humming them all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off stage and is a timeless work of art.
