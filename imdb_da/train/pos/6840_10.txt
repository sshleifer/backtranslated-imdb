The fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. This film is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. The museum's scene is like a good music video. Apres sex scene is an all too familiar scene in all our adult lives. but the film wouldn't hold any interest for me without keith gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. Almost everything I know about acting came from studying mostly his eyes. he had the most compelling face. His character possesses the qualities I see in a guy, sensitivity and dedication. keith gordon is beautiful. BTW, I wish he would shave his beard now as his lips, jaw and Adam's apple were his most beautiful set next to his eyes.
