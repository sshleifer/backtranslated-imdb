I've seen trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that Ned Kelly seems to be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I couldn't take my eyes off it (it got my attention for sure). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, which is seen for a split second looks great. I think this movie will be a hit and it will be seen again and again my many people.
