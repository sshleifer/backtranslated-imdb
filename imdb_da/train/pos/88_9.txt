This was one of the best movies I've seen. The film is related to real life and how drugs can play a major role. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, I found it exciting to see. <br /> <br /> Some don't like the story and say the script is missing direction. But when a person gets so deep into drugs like these signs, there is no direction is life. I feel that this movie is an accurate representation of what can happen to a person if they face extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast are newcomers to the industry. But everyone pulled it off well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a good tool for use with a person or a loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be out of control. This movie can just scare them enough to change their ways.
