I wouldn't even watch this movie after reading Maltin's review and 1 1/2 star rating. I saw it anyway on my son's advice and found it much better than expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you don't know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from high school the year the film was made, so maybe I can relate to the better. Yes, there is some pretension in the movie and it is weird to some extent, but it was the 70s, so what do you expect. I can see why people may not like the movie; However, I can't understand people who say it's boring. The movie is anything but boring. You will either hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you are probably brain dead.
