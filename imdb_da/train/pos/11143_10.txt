Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me sniffling like a baby when I left the theater, didn't try to let anyone see. So when I saw it again in '07, I knew what to expect, and the Sobs were clear and primed as their required moment was approaching. Luckily this time I was home. What I had not remembered from my youthful view - or perhaps had not noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie. Use of flashbacks that tell so much history without resorting to dialogue. The camera's work seemed to place the viewer along with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe crosses the street for dinner, the chamber runs behind the woman and the child sitting on a bench in the foreground and hitting the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters - seedy, sad and brutally real. It is very nice to be drawn so closely into a human drama as this with people most of us would probably ask. So again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I remember when I left the theater I had to find friends of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a hell of a great movie.
