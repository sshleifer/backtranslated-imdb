As a child, I thought this movie was amazing. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now I still love this movie for various reasons. It has well-trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look great on the camera. It has a beautiful, well-written musical music that fits perfectly with the scenes, with tremendous fast melodies and the heart-breaking main theme that still makes me cry. Even when people lobster it. And that has my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on a book, this is the story of three livestock, an intelligent, all-pervading and remarkably paternal lab called Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart, ridiculously curious and somewhat neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Disconnected and worried, pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra Mountains for their journey of life. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe home is just over the mountain. But what if it isn't? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for people who, like the three great actors, give the voices of leading animal characters, and for everyone else ... yes, everyone goes and sees it.
