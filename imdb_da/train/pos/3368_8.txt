A visit to Hitler in Rome is the background to this strange story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays housewife and mother of six children who stay home while the whole family goes to military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay home when the family cannot afford a girl. She would have loved to go even though she, along with the entire residential complex where she lives, is a beautiful admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> There is, however, an exception. Across the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni sits on his chair considering suicide. The reason? He is gay and has recently lost his job as a radio advertiser. The movie really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and needs a friend a lot. Loren, frustrated by his own cheating husband, misunderstands Mastroianni, and in a masterful shot, the scene on the roof of the building complex bestows and acts on her body for him to be rejected. The first shock is soon replaced by her hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, this gay, this other world who is so willing to give her everything she longs for. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully crafted movie featuring two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is a caliber actor when he is really instructed. This is a simple yet strong film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its sad end, there is a glimpse of hope in degradation, things will change, someone has understood it.
