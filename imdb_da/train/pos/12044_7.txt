A young lawyer sent to a remote area to unpack a newly deceased client. Upon arriving, he finds that he is less than welcomed by the local villagers and that his late client was not wanted. To speed things up, he decides to move from the local inn and stay in his home, a house that is usually foggy, and only approaches a waterway that is obstructed by the sea most of the day. Once there he sees a woman's visions in black, she is genuine or imaginary, he is also exposed to a carnage and a child's bleeding screams and drowning in the ants. These events take their way to him and he soon becomes scary. Atmospheric TV adaptation of a famous game by Susan Hill, who spends the first third build of his characters before moving to the creepy country house, immediately gives the bad color contrast its TV roots, it should really have been in black White, but still as a ghost story, it had a few disturbing moments, but after waiting so long to see it, I have to say that I was unfortunately just a little underwhelmed.
