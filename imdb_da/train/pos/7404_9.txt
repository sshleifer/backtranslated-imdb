Just watched the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The programs said it was - A perfect joy - thoroughly crafted, touching, entertaining, dramatic and weakly meaningful. I could not agree more. I just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this entertainment standard, and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films scheduled to appear in Sydney in the coming months.
