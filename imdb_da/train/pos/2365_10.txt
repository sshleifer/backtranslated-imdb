Jeff Wincott is not just a Hunk, he can kick ass! This movie has some of the best martial arts movements I've seen for a very long time. Okay, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a great job anyway! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by Martial Arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares? She's as good, if not better! (just check their match scene at the end of the movie, a word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you haven't seen it, you really lack some good martial arts actions.
