All that talent Mr Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 films, I thought was an accident because his fourth one Main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad. But I have to say that it was not an accident. This guy is talented and the way he has done Vivah is just brilliant. Right from the first scene, it affects you. The sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome. The chemistry between these two actors gives a glimpse of it between srk and kajol. As always Alok Nath as the good and loving father is amazing, then Anupam Kher is. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks great in most scenes, although shahid looks a little young to get married, but he does a good job with a shy but still morally strong groom. This film will especially be desired by those who have gone through such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all, a brilliant movie. hats off to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
