While it is a bit of a sermon on the progress of humanity's saving grace, it is still a great movie that presents the science-fiction special blockbuster that would take another 40 years to appear on the silver screen. It predicts the global chaos of World War II, but expands on the premise of having the conflict for the past 30 years and then tells the epic tale of human struggle under the ruins and into the wilderness. The play seems wood and oddly sterile, but it is perhaps a result of its contrast to the images that must have been absolutely breathtaking at the time of the film's release and still impress today. This is a movie that should not be missed by anyone interested in the SF genre.
