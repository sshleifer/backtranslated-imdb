TIllman Jr.'s drama about the first African-American marine diver (Gooding Jr.) who challenges all odds and achieves his goals despite a strictly cursed trainer. The play is not bad, sometimes extreme, but the direction and play is top notch, and this movie is inspiring and achieves what it needs to do. I liked DeNiro at the forefront, although it is not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and everyone else) it is as good as his other good performances as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and trustworthy here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, certainly one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rated: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
