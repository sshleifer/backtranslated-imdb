This is how a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of what is very surreal. It has this unpleasant overtone, rarely recorded on film, it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark exciting memory. The kids were extremely trustworthy and I expect some things to come from them in the future. Very natural to such young people, I do not know if Bill pulled it out of them or just as well, but nevertheless excellent. Bill scored as far as I'm concerned and for KevNJeff's comment on Mr. Paxton's bad action, what can be done in that role. He played the part quite well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (The Ethan Hawke Version?) Wow ......... Don't listen to his comments. Great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable if that's what you want? Cinematography gets an above average too.
