Alain Resnais movies are scary in the way that they are not really edited for continuity, but instead the shot seems to end just where a memory has edited. Love of death is sometimes a quiet existential drama and a round of creative magic realistic film and somehow the audience treats a whole new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps creates a new relationship, namely Agape / Thanatos. The beginning is like a bizarre surreal horror movie. A woman runs desperately around the house, while a man is dying in his bed - she killed him, or what happened? Soon the excitement will be dissolved when a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead, but from there a newer foreign drama begins: The man wakes up and after being dead, the woman and man fall in love with actually quite tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, both of whom are priests, are aware of their own debate about the nature of love, faith and devotion. Resnais always seems to have some devices to do these kinds of narratives work, and what's so great about his movies is that these devices always work. In this case, the Resnais unites the scenes with snowfall that falls to an arousing orchestral score that falls off and bleeds into the subsequent shoots that continue the story. Captured in this elegant side on a regular basis, the film develops a rhythm that is not too epic, and I got strange flashbacks to Dante's divine comedy from this, despite the lack of direct reference in the movie. Resnais is known as a very poetic film maker, but this extends past the cinepoem structure only to something that strengthens some degree of introspection in the viewer, which has the potential to bring some odd returns to the surface. Memory story, creates Resnais. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
