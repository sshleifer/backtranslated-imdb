Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue and nowhere is this clearer than the lines he gives WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposite types in ODD COUPLE - a blend of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of two such inconsistent friends sharing an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar, bent on suicide after his wife's divorce and reluctantly agrees to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with some disastrous results. Seems that everything Felix says and drives Oscar up the wall, and that no one can stand against each other's ways, with Oscar being the most modest male imaginable and Felix the opposite. <br /> <br /> The most active scene for me was when giggling pigeons sisters in the apartment over visit them at a dinner date. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in the sting. The talented Pigeon sisters are the gals who made the voices of the Gabble sisters (a few geese) in Disney's The Archives, and here is their comic timing on the past of Lemmon's sad past enough to turn the movie into hilarious - where it remains much of the time . <br /> <br /> If you are a Neil Simon fan and have had other screen treatments of his work, this one should not miss. Matthau and Lemmon are completely cast (although they were considering exchanging roles before the movie began) and of course it's easy to see why it became a top-rated television show later. <br /> <br /> Summary: Top Simon's comedy, not to be missed.
