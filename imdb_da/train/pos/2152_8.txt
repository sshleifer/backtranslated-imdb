There were some amazing moments of reality in it depicting today's life (not just in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how the stifling ones culture can be and wants to break out of shape is created for you. The dance was just a vehicle to say "do what you love even if it's against the norm". Rather, Billy Elliot as I would say. I also enjoyed that movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real you could feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and the wig and his exaggerated ability on the dance floor simply made me howl! The actors all did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I saw it another time and caught some small shades that I missed at the first show. Good entertainment!
