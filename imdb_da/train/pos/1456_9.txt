Documentaries of this kind are often very perceived. This movie seems to take all the opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad that these poor people work in, this film does a good job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops. The movie Mardi Gras: Made in China was a great way to show the world how something as petty as pearls for a party can affect the lives of so many people in another country. I had to watch this movie in an English class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to remove them, and this movie helped get the item rolling. It was a great, very informative movie and I would recommend anyone to see it, it just opens your eyes.
