Hollywood North is a satirical appearance at the time of Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax cuts for film made in Canada. Most of the time, it was treated like a tax house or a cheap way to get American movies. For example, Porky's came out of it. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a beginner producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel. But to get the money, he needs an American star. He gets a loose cannon and learns that he must compromise on the point where the movie does not resemble the book it was originally based on. It plays well in Canada but cannot be understood outside the Great White North. The Americans will believe we are satirizing ourselves, but will miss the point that we are actually satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
