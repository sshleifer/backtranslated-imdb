Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like movie set among the ruins of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there are very inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who becomes emotionally involved in a woman whom he doesn't really understand and whose naivety is more striking as opposed to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that The Third Man has a more well-built story. Zentropa is slightly different in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and doing it too coherently would destroy the effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly ugly - "noir" in more than one sense; you never see the sun shine. Grim, but exciting and scary.
