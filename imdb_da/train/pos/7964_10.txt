It surprises me how much I love this movie, even though I don't like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a wonderful job with the Chance, Sassy and Shadow voices, and the animals' performance is just amazing. I've seen this movie 72 times already (I know it sounds scary but that's right!) And every time the end scenes still get me. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. It's actually my all-time favorite movie!
