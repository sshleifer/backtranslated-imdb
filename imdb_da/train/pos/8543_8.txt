This was one of those movies I would probably never have picked from the shelf, but it came on IFC one day and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would really have missed a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - young writer paralyzed in climbing accidents in a low-class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tears. But it does not happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez after he had been persistently paralyzed. No Hollywood happiness here. All of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds, but they share a feeling of helplessness, being with each other. Stolz is very good as a "lone wolf" type, forced to embarrass dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine as a former ladies man whose family is falling apart; But William Forsythe takes the cake as a hard guy who is determined to make someone pay to remove his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
