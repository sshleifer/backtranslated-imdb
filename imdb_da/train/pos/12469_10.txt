It's a great movie. I saw that some people think this may not be based on a true story. Regardless of this !!, the movie is amazing and all you can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid ended up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead of thinking that "a little girl's wish became true" that means that all our peaceful dreams come true if we trust and do everything in this world to make them right. The little girl (Desi - in the movie) and her mother were the best actors I have seen for a long time. Good for them, for all actors, everything for the director. If anyone can tell them this, please tell them, "A 25-year-old guy from Romania says thank you for making this movie".
