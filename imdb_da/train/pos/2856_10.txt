This is one of the movies that gets better every time you see them. It's filled with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in Sabu's subsequent film (I did not see "unfortunate monkey" yet, but the others are just as big) failure, chance and humanism play big roles. The cutting and mounting is inventive and artistic, without the film being an "art" image, but a very entertaining one. When you compare it to "Run, Lola, Run", keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was made some years before and was shown on German TV already in 1997 ... so it's more likely to serve as inspiration for Tom Tykwer's film, and not the other way around. In addition to the other reviews, I must add that I like the play and the end a lot. This movie is very fun in many ways and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
