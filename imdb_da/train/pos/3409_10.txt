North Africa in the 1930s. To a small Arabian town on the edge of the Sahara, a beautiful woman looking for meaning for her life comes and a beautiful trappist monk escapes from her crisis crisis. They will meet, and passions will be touched, but not even true diviners know if they will find happiness or sorrow here in ALLAH'S GARD. <br /> <br /> The reason is pure hokum, but the film is still fun and beautiful to watch. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer is a fantastic screensaver. She is, to put it simply, beautiful, and Boyer gives a most effective, discreet performance, so his sensitive face makes much of his play for him. <br /> <br /> The support molding is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all the "Arabic" he and other talks in the film are pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a Gentle Mother Superior Alan Marshal as an Honest Young French Officer; Tilly Losch as Dangerous Dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic gates; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and magnified Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a certain old priest. <br /> <br /> Movie Mavens recognizes Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (looking over the nun's shoulder) as monastic girls; gaunt Nigel De Brulier as monastery lecturer; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as hotel consultant, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> Color films from the 1930s are both rare and lovely to watch, and this film is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. ALLAH-GARDEN was the first Technicolor movie to be shot on the spot. Yuma, Arizona provided the filmmakers with all the dunes they could wish for, but contaminated drinking water and 135 degrees of heat soon revolted. When the daily rushes showed that Boyer's face had burnt a bright tomato red, the producer finally gave David O. Selznick. The rest of the movie was shot at a Hollywood sound stage.
