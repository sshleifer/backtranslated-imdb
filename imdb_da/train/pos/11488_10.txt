I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week. I had never heard of the movie and I had my reservations about it. Just from looking at the box, I knew the movie was an indie film, and the quality would therefore be less than a mainstream movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that when I finished seeing Zero Day, I started it again from the beginning. The film clearly followed the basic disposition of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how credible the two main players were. My first time through watching this movie was not entirely sure if what I was watching was the actual tapes left by the sliders on Columbine. In the back of my mind I knew what I was looking at could not be right, but at the same time the actor was so convincing that you had to keep a head on a shake. <br /> <br /> Is the movie disturbing? Absolutely! Do you want to see things that make you question the movie's profit? Probably. I think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two main characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is it problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, I felt a tremendous sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a terrible point. They had fallen so deep through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road that could have been stopped if only the people around them had noticed their situation. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close and personal look at events that most of us will only see the conclusion of the news. It lets you think about the lives involved. And it leaves you confused about how people come to this point. One week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who haven't seen Zero Day, keep in mind the following: The movie is an independent with little or no budget and the movie is recorded on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put all that aside, Zero Day is a movie that sticks to you and maybe helps you open your eyes a little.
