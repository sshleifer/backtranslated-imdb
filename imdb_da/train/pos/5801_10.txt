This movie is exciting, bold and the music is very good. The movie Moonwalker was supposed to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have Bad. It's excellent (*****). The movie begins with Michael Jackson performing "Man In The Mirror" on stage. It shows a story about Michael, from his early days in Jackson 5 right up to the bad era. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is a music video parody of the music video for the Bad single). It then shows the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the video are very, very good indeed.Same to leave me alone that appears after. Then it shows the movie Moonwalker. After a few minutes, he plays a smooth criminal in a club called club 30. Like that when he does lean.anyway, nice to see you. Goodbye.
