PERHAPS, in an attempt to find another "Hot Property" for customization, the Fleischer brothers thought back to their very successful decadence in the World War with their 1933 POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount) production. Although it was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B. performed only a short look in the short; leaves the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series. <br /> <br /> As is now widely known, the gruff, villainous eyed, brawlin sailor has become the most successful cartoon series ever; foreigner and literally hand over Fleischers and their Studio, which lasted until today. <br /> <br /> Returning to King Properties for another attempt at luck was undoubtedly the reason for trying out the very popular HENRY cartoon character in a BETTY BOOP excursion; The purpose is to search for another series. The reasoning certainly looked good. HENRY was a most popular feature of Hearst Papers' line-up; appears as both Daily and Sunday's Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, "What stupid these mortals are!" Remember, Schultz? In seeing the shabby, small, bald boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his on screen antics, both solo and tandem with Miss Betty; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well the character was handled. The story and director Dave Fleischer both gave a series of cartoon-like situations and synagogues that seemed most appropriate for the little Henry's character. These silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in the remaining faithful to the printed page; when the HENRY function was mostly made in a kind of 4-color 'mime'. In the comic book entitled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935) we see what is; basically is a situational exercise; gets separated with the usual selection of Dave Fleischer's fast fire, machine gun-like gags. In short, Henry sees a puppy in the window of Betty Boops Pet Shop. It is a kind of love at first sight when Henry tries to buy the little puppy dog ​​with the only money he had for coins in his pocket. He is in the form of Miss Boop that it would be $ 2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase. Tears look like the little guy leaves the reject. <br /> <br /> BUT a postponement is soon on the horizon when Betty asks the boy to think about the store while leaving the acute business. In return for his services, Miss Betty promises him the little dog in return. Of course they have a deal and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> Giving to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the animal allows Fleischer Crew to fire a whole new string of gags; this time with bird seeds, Henry's bald pate and pushing bridges. (But not quite of course, Schultz!) Henrik's enthusiasm for mass feeding the bird's population of the store by first literally seizing the head quickly leads to a mass disruption of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a lot of prison break. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this vision and expresses his disappointment and anger with Henry's temporary care. All bets were off, no dogs to Henry. He begins to leave; disheartened; But soon convince the proprietor to give him another shot to settle things. His head is covered with bird seeds, he manages to correlate all the small feathered birds; Will return to their coop shop. Fortunately, the little trap leaves; But this time he has his own loving, small, facial puppy. <br /> <br /> This was a winning combination UNDOUBETLY. We have the carefree, energetic, freewheel boy, Betty's kindness and feelings of the situation and the dubious outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation. Max and Dave Fleischer had given us a kind of almost smaller mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy card. <br /> <br /> We were completely surprised that no HENRY series followed. Judging by the rather faithful treatment of the character, it could certainly have been persistent for some time. In any case, this teaming was in many ways the best of Betty Boop's sample images. Although the first, POPEYE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and barely had any Betty Boop in it, except for a cameo as carnival hula dancer); HENRY Short was much better than the two following King Features "tryouts", BETTY BOOP AND THE LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both in 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
