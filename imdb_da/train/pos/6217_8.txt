Follow the fleet, an RKO production in 1936, the stars Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a complex romantic comedy. While Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have had many similar romantic films together, RKO helped them once again make a worthy story incorporating relevant situations for society at the time of its creation. The story of Follow the Fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of protagonists to create a satisfying romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> The general plot of the movie is about Bake Baker, a US Navy sailor played by Fred Astaire, and Sherry Martin, Bake's former love and dance partner, who is now a singer and dancer played by Ginger Rogers . Their story begins when Bake is on the ship, and his shipman Bilge Smith finds a picture of both of them together, and Bake reveals that he saw her last time that he had asked her to marry him, so Bilge suggests that they trying to meet up with her when on land, hoping she might have a friend. <br /> <br /> The next big stage begins the second plot of the movie when Connie Martin, Sherry's sister, is denied access to paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman. She turns around to find Bilge behind her with a bag full of drinks, so she looks like she was waiting for him and also buys his entrance to Paradise. Connie then finds Sherry and tells her she's depressed because she can't get her luck Sherry does with men, so Sherry suggests she gets a makeover from her friends while performing on stage. Connie finishes and enters the ballroom again, and approaches Bilge again, who is confused by her sight. This begins the second romantic story between Bilge and Connie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the movie, the story and rising actions are shifted between changing comic reliefs of the two couples' problems, creating more mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot. Bake and Sherry beat it from their first moments as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it and reminding them of success and pleasure the two have when they are together. Similarly, Bilge can swim Connie through her romantic attempts to please her and retire to her house. <br /> <br /> This series of happy events is soon followed by worrying actions that bring back the rising action. Bage left Sherry the previous night to step back to the ship before midnight and told her he would come to her in the morning. Unfortunately, the ship sets off after shipowners return, disturbs Sherry and leaves her thinking that Bake was still a typical sailor looking for a good time when he is on land. <br /> <br /> The mood changes again as another subplot is introduced into the movie when a "big shot party" takes a ride on the ship. This alternative story is used to create a buffer between the stories of the film's two main relationships, as well as helping to create trust and love for Bake's overall good intentions. The party is interrupted by the ignorant music game coming from Bake and his companions, as they missed the sound of reporting on tires to the company. The ladies are fascinated and pray to hear them play, and Bake is happy to entertain them with a lot of dancing, which ultimately helps to brighten the mood of the movie and bring pleasure to the sailors. <br /> <br /> After returning to the couple's interwoven stories, Sherry tries to prove to Bake that she doesn't need her help landing a job. Unfortunately, Bake is unaware that she is an audition, and goes to put a good word to Sherry when he overhears his friend in the studio and talks about the remarkable lady auditioning. Bake takes on herself to help Sherry out by manipulating her water so she can't sing properly and destroy her audition. In addition to Bake's mistake, Connie used all her money to repair a ship, hoping that Bilge would take over as captain. She had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was to pass by, but Bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon getting married and was no longer interested, so he stood up. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling action until the climax point is reached between the two pairs, ending the movie with both pairs of happiness. The use of the altered stories helps to create interest and emotions within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles. The coinciding stories can also relate to each other, and incorporate other non-related subplots to help carry the narrative through to the final stages. <br /> <br /> Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have innumerable films that include romance, comedy, song and dance, Fleet follows a unique movie for the two actors who successfully use subplot techniques to help narrate between the two main characters.
