I am a fan of television films in general, and that was one of the good ones. The throwing performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists I couldn't see before every commercial. For me it was a bit like Medium meets CSI. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else read that in some light the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I would definitely see it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. Have not seen her in many things and she made her work very convincing. <br /> <br /> If you go into the movie mystery movie, check this out if you have a chance.
