While I'm not a big fan of musicals, I've loved the movies of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they're just so much fun. Sure, they can be a bit formal, but even if you know what will happen, they are still very happy to see. But despite this, I was a little disappointed with this excursion. Part of it was because this movie does not have the wonderful supporting cast that you saw in TOP HAT or MUST WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be a bit lacking - especially in the "fun" section. The stupid antics of these supportive actors gave the other movie charms that you just don't get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. Unlike the ordinary character played by Astaire, this one is more of a shake - as his fat head gets Rogers in trouble over and over. And as a result, it is much harder to like him or will see them come together at the end of the movie. Plus, although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs do not seem as memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special, and I can't remember any of them, even though I just watched the movie. Although this is still a sweet and dignified movie, it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films. Good but far from great.
