It is worth seeing, especially with a journalist's great twist with integrity, and you expect a great hit story as Gray Owl is unnoticed as a fraud, but it should not be and add to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of history and the movie. <br /> <br /> This should be Brosnan's best performance to date, he admires convincingly as the English boy playing Indians. The stand-out scene is his return? Aunts? where Brosnan and the two older lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of sense of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, only with expression and good direction. Perfect. The story is so little known, and the message is so universal and all important, it's a real shame, this movie didn't get any better recognition, perhaps over time it might become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
