Neither the total catastrophe claimed by British critics nor the misunderstood masterpiece that his few fanboys insist on is Revolver at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers. But then nothing more despised than an ambitious movie that bites more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster / con artist movie frame. As can be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as a producer, there is a clear element in the 'Cinema de look' about it: put in a kind of realistic fantasy world, where America and Britain overlap what it looks good, have a few excellent edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all marking it as a one-time entertainment. But Ritchie will definitely do more than just rehash his own movies for a quick buck, and he has spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If that's something, it's a problem he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, many chess principles), motifs and techniques that scrape the screen with quotes: The movie was originally intended to end with three minutes epigrams of images of bodies of mob victims, and at times it feels like he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. Instead of a commercial for Kabbalism, it is truly a blend of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess, and error of confidence, which to a large extent draw the trick of making theosophy available while saving the film's (somewhat metaphysical) final third is where most of the problems can be found when Jason Statham takes the enemy (literally) into with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful cross-sections within the framework of contrasting human outer bravado with their inner fear and anger, but has a lot to do for it all. Not worth starting a new religion, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Perhaps they found Ray Liotta's intentionally false tan too horrifying?
