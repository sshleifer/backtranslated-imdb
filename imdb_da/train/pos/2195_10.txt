I loved it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, a slightly gifted, proud yet highly vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard) who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie comes from a ship and ends in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets knocked in her nose after her insults Maggie by thinking of her a loose woman - all because she knocked out her hat in public. Great fights and Maggie end up in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are good together. Maggie is always there for him when he needs her. She encourages him to go to NY where (well watch the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together, where she sings in her arms while playing the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
