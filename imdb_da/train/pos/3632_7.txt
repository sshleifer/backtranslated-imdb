As predictable as a Hallmark card but not without profit, The Rookie makes a solid outing. Dennis Quaid, the most sensible jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect as the science teacher beat baseball player Jimmy Morris. The movie is never stupid for the kids, as one might expect from a G-rated movie. As a sports movie, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since Any Given Sunday.
