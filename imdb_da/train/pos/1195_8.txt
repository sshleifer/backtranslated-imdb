I watched this movie twenty years ago on the late show. I still remember the movie, especially Robert Taylor's performance. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor, as most critics saw him as a solid, almost boring man, and women simply loved watching his movies because of his appearance. However, this movie showed which interesting actor he could be. He didn't get enough roles like this in his long career. This is his best performance. He is completely trustworthy in a truly vicious role. From what I read, he was a very hard-working and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kinds of roles. He would basically just do what MGM gave him. This film shows that he could have handled several different and difficult roles. The other thing I can remember about this movie is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene in the movie is stuck with me for all these years. This movie is definitely worth a visit.
