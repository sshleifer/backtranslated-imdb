The audience back in 1936 must have been stunned by what they looked at: a full-length, beautiful full-length Technicolor movie. I can't say for sure, but it could have been the first (3-strip). At least it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. In fact, just as good it looks incredible. Kudos for going to Director Richard Boleslowski, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and to DVD-MGM Home Entertainment. All combined to give us one of the best movies in the classical age. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was uneven: Excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. It gave a nice message in the end, although many may not have been happy about it. I can't say more without spoiling things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I don't think, and certainly never played such a soft heart ("Domini Enfilden"). Heart-throb Charles Boyer was the male star and Dominis the subject of love, but some of the smaller characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch;" John Carradine as "Sand Diviners;" The most memorable, for me at least, was the dancer "Irena", played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there's a face and a dance you won't soon forget! I've never seen anything like that in the thousands of movies I've seen. Just watching her make her stuff worth the price of the DVD. Watching her IMDb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all known movies. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing "Sherlock Holmes", is also here as is C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day. By the way, Schildkraut will be recognized by classic movie buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales consultant in the big hit "The Shop Around The Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, photography and color and Tillys dance are the things I remember best about this movie, which is a lot of good and not so good things that everyone rolled into one. Had the last half hour been better - though I admire the end - I would have rated it even higher. It is certainly a movie collector that will add to their collection.
