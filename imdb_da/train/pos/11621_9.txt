I was bored one night, and Red Eyes were on and thinking why not. <br /> <br /> Red-eye is one of the best movies of a long time. I think I just came in. The movie caused it to be just so brilliant. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The movie also has two great links in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The action is just brilliant and you get the feeling for the people in the movie. The music is just excellent, it gives you chills and can also make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I just love how the movie was just as good and it never gets boring. Red eyes are just phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. On the whole, I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can see it again and again. <br /> <br /> If you like red eyes, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie
