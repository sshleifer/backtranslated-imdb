Note that all those who did not like and enjoy this movie commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differs from the book. I do not understand this type of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and stories, movies have about 120 minutes. Still, the film has the benefits of stimulating multiple senses: visual, sound and imagination. I don't care if a movie is as good as or actually has any similarity to the book on which it is based. So what? I judge it for what it is. <br /> <br /> This movie was charming. An old and often seen story that is inclined to clich√© could easily have been embarrassing. However, the reef and Reeves pull it out. One reviewer found the reef far to old. I would never have guessed that she was 40 when she made this movie. It is for her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. I also think it's about the best Reeves has ever done. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the play could have used "tightening". Nevertheless, it is worth seeing; Clearly not a strong love story, but rather a charming romance that will leave you happy that love is a strong feeling and good overcomes evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the mandatory f # $% word, naked buttocks or spit-swapping kissing hours. Finally, musical scores are excellent.
