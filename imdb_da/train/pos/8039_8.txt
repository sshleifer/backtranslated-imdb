Sniper gives a real new meaning to war movies. I can remember movies about Vietnam or WWII, lots of firing, all die, bam bam. "Sniper" takes war to a new level or refinement. The film surely conveys all the emotions it has for its purpose - the human helplessness of the jungle, the hatred and the ultimate trust between Beckett and Miller and the moment they pull the trigger. An apparently low budget movie represents for every mistake of action, excitement and excitement, for when it comes down to it, it is only a shot, a killer.
