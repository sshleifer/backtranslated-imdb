Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman in her working-class universe as a secretary; She is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring an intern as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life: but the guy just comes out of jail. Their both are rejected by the society reuniting them gradually. Characters'description is profund, goes into detail ... Both begin to help each other; because she can read on the lips, which turns out to be very useful to him ... She will gradually develop far from what she was in the first place. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully busy; The whole thing is very convincing, even though it becomes a movie noir at the end. Gesture is especially beautifully observed in Audiard's film. Emmanuelle Devos will be named Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistrate's games. The action towards the end of the movie prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". It is actually surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
