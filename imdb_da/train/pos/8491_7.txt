I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after being here for three years, afraid I would ring when I considered it in the hard light of my extended international experience. The movie pleasantly surprised me with how precisely it portrays the cultural context between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am from). Not all things are actually spot on, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan many years later and I continue to enjoy this movie for its uniform treatment of the two sides of history. Interestingly, although the Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialogue is redirected in the Japan edition to cover obvious language delivery problems. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan by watching this movie than by reading some of the "serious" books in the case (most of which were written in the 80s and funded of Japanese propaganda Japanese companies). <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by drawing on the average rating of one-star reviewers who, among other things, found it inappropriate for the Japanese to build cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction.) This is a very hot and fun movie that I would rate higher if it wasn't for a couple of 80's clich√©s that were dancing to cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been more fun.
