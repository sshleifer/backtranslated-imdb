It's hard to imagine that this movie is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to do the miracle is so heartbreaking. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had made to create this handicapped character. Seeing him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is a little light and exciting. Christy is not despised by the norms, his life is also colorful and lovely, although we may be aware of the loneliness and the painful cousin through his eyes. An important factor for Christy's success is his mother's support that seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, using this cool little medieval woman all of them to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christy, what a child's achievement! Christy's love story is very well-educated, trusting. Christy wants love, and nothing can deduce him with the right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, the shabby Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is truly beyond my heart, yet any woman has her own youth. ..) is paranoial and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a triangular sword, happiness and pain are right next to each other. <br /> <br /> Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER, etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying ', god knows why he chose to lead that lap! Really a career for him, what a shame!
