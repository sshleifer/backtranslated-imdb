This story in Wellington, New Zealand suburbia (Tawa home of the famous Tawa College) is McCart's first move. <br /> <br /> With a modern New Zealand flavor Via Satellite, there is an abundance of absolutely hilarious situations that evolve in the (adult) family context. At the same time, it manages to invoke intense feelings of sadness and despair. <br /> <br /> One of the year's most moving and humorous movies - not to be missed!
