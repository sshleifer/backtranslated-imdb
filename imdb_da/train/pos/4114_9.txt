The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in operation, because it is the sound that a retarded young man does while driving his imaginary cart, which is what he does all day. And he is just one of many odd signs in this surreal and sometimes tragic tale of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. There are two drunks who act wives who are a man of ambition to be an architect and his young son, whom he sends out to ask for food. There is a wise old man who seems to be mindful of everything going on around him, and there is a businessman with some serious nervous bitches who has a wife who treats him (and everyone else) as dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no particular plot for this, it really is a lot of stories that go back and forth between each other, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all, I thought it worked pretty well and I had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description. I was not least disappointed and I would definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10
