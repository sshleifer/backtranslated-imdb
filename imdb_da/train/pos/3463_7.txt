I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. Yet I knew quite a bit about the Beatles music and the truth behind the breakdown, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band Wings. I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the crash. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references used by the two musicians were very precise. These included how Yoko Ono would always be with John, where he ended, the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" was number one hit that year, and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios played music from the album "Let It Be." The actors did a very good job of playing John and Paul. The centers could have used a little more work, but they seemed to be much like reading the two previous Beatles used to act. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. The end of the start disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it, especially as this was how it really went. They also show the amazing shit from "Saturday Night Live" where the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to perform on the show. (compared to the $ 220 million others offered them) All in all, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you more sense of why the Beatles broke up and why they never came together again.
