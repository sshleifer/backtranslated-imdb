Diane and I saw this amazing movie today in Fremantle, and we both agreed that the pastiche films were head and shoulders above the rest. I say this because we were entranced by the short five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course the theme was love in its many forms. <Br /> <br /> Probably the film took place in the various Parisian arrondissements, giving a particular flavor to each segment. Having been to Paris several times, I was not knowledgeable enough to easily recognize the sites, but I am sure Europeans and especially French people could easily recognize the city's locations. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into each story because of their expertise, so that these urban areas coincide. <br /> <br /> The movie moves fast, and the viewer leaves behind a scenario while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thoughtful and gentle as with most of the life without the media crap that bury so much of the beauty of life under the closest dung high just to sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Join someone you care about and let this magic little movie ask you as a spa treatment and when you leave my guess, you will feel renewed.
