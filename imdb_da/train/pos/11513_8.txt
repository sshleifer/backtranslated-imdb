One of my favorite shows back in the 70s. As I recall, it went on Friday (or possibly Saturday) night at Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. Each episode usually reached a climax with Chalkback having to go hand in hand with a kind of supernatural opponent. For their credit, the authors made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode where the opponent was the spirit of an old Indian boss who came back as a massive electric current that started killing people in a city hospital. The final showdown so Kolchack tries to short-circuit the power beast in the middle of an explosion of sparks and undulating flames. Oh yes .... you had to be there at the time, but that was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles, which was one of his best. br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the TV's "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vincenzo .... 'Chuck you are at it' ... or in case of the Hall of Fame, 'IN IT'!
