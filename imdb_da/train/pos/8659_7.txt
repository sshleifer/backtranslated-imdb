Somehow, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg on the Shredder? Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and Mick Jagger? Big moments caught on film safe, but the movie still kind of sucks, right? That's how I feel about "Rich in Love". A man hears his wife sing for the first time. Post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice from the forest and in another scene he has a lovely waking moment with regard to his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to her plays. But there is only the whisper of a plot here, and you can't wait for it to move. Only when ex-Go's' Charlotte Caffey's The Graces transforms a big pop song, the picture awakens ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This picture is similar to a lazy summer day in the deep US south.
