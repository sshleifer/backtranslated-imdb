Great movie when I saw it. Must say one of my favorite movies all the time. I saw it 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. When I got older and saw it again, I realized that the movie is average. Compared to movies known for good comedys, it is nothing. I think Rock was fun in the movie, and the whole shift with the racing materials breaks a small barrier, which is great. Also, the idea of ​​how the film goes is a good way of thinking. It's like most people thought of a movie, but also a little twist, which is a very good touch. I like the movie overall, so I give it a ... Still a good 7/10 for me.
