As far as the parody films go, few are worth time and energy. But with a recent revival of horrible parodies like Date Movie and Comebacks, coming back and rediscovering a really fun farce like Johnny Dangerously is a breath of fresh air. After his mother has no end to medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mob. Which fallows are a series of gags, most of which work, however, there are occasional flops. But a foreign gangster who can't master the American language (at least frugally), a rival gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth (... sometime!), A younger brother with D.A. who is out to get Johhny Dangerously, and a warm young starlet who is hot for his feelings, Johnny is busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, as each gangster movie clich√© is skewed by a talented cast and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect for a long shot, but definitely for a smile on a bad day.
