The Dirty Harry series began with very gritty cop action, and was almost immediately relieved of the "Magnum Force". At the time when "The Enforcer" rolled around, Dirty Harry was a little more than a television cop show (tucked only by Tyne Daly). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry has finally gone back to his roots. Maybe he has been away for a long time this time. Clint Eastwood makes the first orderly Harry movie since Don Siegel made the first, which helps significantly. Harry is another darker character, not the cozy policeman he had become. He can again say things like "Go ahead, make my day" and really mean it. "Sudden Impact" is a true Dirty Harry sequel. "Enforcer" should never have been done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
