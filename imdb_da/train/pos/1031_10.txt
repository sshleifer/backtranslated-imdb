This series is set one year after mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate. It explains a lot of things that the film neglected to mention. How was Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld (Ra's race) come from? How many are there? <br /> <br /> The first episode has a retired Jack O'Neill (spelled with 2 ls) recalled to active duty by General George Hammond because of an attack by the closed Stargate of Apophis, a strong Goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped a woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims to have been through Stargate for the first time, and is determined to go through now. We find out that Daniel was married to Abydos and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can call. Then Dania's wife is caught by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC, which includes nine teams, where Jack's team becomes SG-1, consisting of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a Goa'uld homeland to save Denmark's wife and another trapped with Abydos by the name of Ska'ra. They get caught, and like Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, saves a Jaffa named Teal'c, Apophis First Prime, them and goes to Earth with them where he is part of SG-1. <br /> <br /> It was just the beginning of the adventure. During the show, they have gone to the past and the future, been transported to alternative realities, swapping organs, old, met alien races that include a rebel alliance of the Goa'uld called the Tok'ra, where Samantha's father becomes a member, Asgard, a sweet little race, where we often see Thor (he's Jack's mate), and avoid global catastrophe by their teeth in countless times. <br /> <br /> The view was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new forces, new dangers and highlighting new mysteries around the Stargate and its creators, the ancient. The season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder such as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female man from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. <br /> <br /> Very well-produced, interesting characters, amazing special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all. Another way to raise the galaxy and different kinds of adventure, this is a show you will not miss. Unlock the gate and go through. You will not regret it!
