Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported by several news agencies for their long-standing commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and giving an example of the context of Gene Roddenberry's mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of various races is on par or exceeds the other Trek series and films. The production value started as less and chopped, but during the 7 production seasons, the play has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have become smoother and more impressive. In Season 6 Episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the greatest space battles in Trek history. The ships are well made and the space games are impressive and exciting. The right drawing for Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is human and the interaction and growth of characters. There are also nodes to other Trek series and movies with places and signs that we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to check countermeasures and you will be hooked!
