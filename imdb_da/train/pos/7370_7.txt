Some have compared this movie to Release. I believe in mice and men is more appropriate. Our leading man, Heaton, absolutely loves Spike. It is irrelevant and immaterial whether it is a sexual love. That's why Heaton doesn't leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as family, as their only connection to humanity. The setting, scenario, minimal cast all adds up to a nice movie. Frankly, I didn't care what happened to the characters. But I care what the filmmaker did with them. He did well with them. I ate a little time and wondered how the ending would look like mice and men. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and exciting.
