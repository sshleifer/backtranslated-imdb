How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. The Story fascinated me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and please see the entire first season before you decide that it is bad because I know that if you see the first season, you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on DVD and then participate in campaign to get season 3 made! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox, and I'm sure many of your "Dark Angel" fans also hate them. They have a thing for Canning Good Shows! Do not you agree?
