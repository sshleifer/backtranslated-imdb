Don't listen to the pricey critics who are likely to be bitter players who are still wounded by the rustling Silverman, who gently gave them to the Spike TV Video Game a few months ago, "The Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature and ridiculous and would fit pretty nicely into an adult swimming line-up. If Silverman tones down the young "doody" jokes and underlines the darker, more subdued show, so far it is just to be suggested we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since it canceled "Strangers With Candy". But from watching the pilot, it's just solid, not unique, scary dark comedy / musical, but with great potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a fun baby woman of a character - a more beautiful, younger Jewish American princess version of the late-sized Jerri Blank and the show is one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical portraits of a gay couple I have ever seen on television. Early reviews suggest that the next few episodes surpass the pilot, so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds.
