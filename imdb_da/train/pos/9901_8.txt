This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It's stars Caroline Munro, from both Dr. Phibes movie (she was his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, Sinbad's Golden Voyage, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy who loved me, Maniac and Faceless. /> <br /> Brought to you by the people behind. Don't open for Christmas and slices. Here's my thoughts on this ... <br /> <br /> It opens on April Fools Day, where a bunch of kids play a deepened prank on the school's geek, promising him sex in the shower and giving him public humiliation and a face on the toilet (while he is naked!). The coach stops it, but both parties swear revenge. But the cool kids stop burning the geek alive. <br /> <br /> Cut the future and its High School reunion, or they think (bwahahha?). The only ones with invitations were the gang that burned the child and its April Fools Day (or really the day before April Fools, but the mother starts at midnight), but they fail to see chance and hang out in front of school until evening. Then they finally break into school and it starts to storm. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drink and a small shrine for each of them, each of their closets and belongings along with Marty's (nerds) locker and yearbook. They also find the old black officer / caretaker who spends his time saying "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I don't want any trouble, sir!" and then killed immediately. Exactly meaningless character, but hes still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a side out of Alien's book, in a gory way that you just have to see! Thats when everyone realizes they are there to die and they start freaking out, except Shirley who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at some point like this. Of course, it bleeds blood and acid and her face melts (very cool, remember you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty kills everyone while you're on the mascot .. What's their plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait for dinner. Marty won't kill us in the middle of the day!" Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently, you can only kill at night. But will they survive through the night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all the organs disappearing? Rent, buy or steal this amazing movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clich√©s (car won't start, DAMMIT!) And just plain slasher fun. Not to mention they have all names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to you all! And not to mention, it has a spin off! 1989's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people have sex, the guy will quit, but the girl does not. "Talk dirty to me, Frank !!" she screams "Uh ... tits!" "Dirty!" "Uh ... tits. F * ck. Breasts. Boobs. F * ck." It seems to work for her and her climax, the electrode throws them both!
