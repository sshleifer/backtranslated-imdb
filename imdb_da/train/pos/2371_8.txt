I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he committed when he had already seen the movie and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a little campy since the version on our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be a Halloween rip off with a killer tree guy. But it opened with a good scene, and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later when his son, who had witnessed him, killed the two people (including his mother) and he himself testified that his father's Suicide goes to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his father's spirit. Pretty good for a sequel and I've never seen the first one.
