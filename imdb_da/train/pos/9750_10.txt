Yes, Giorgio, is a good movie. A little romance, good music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a good food game), and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of Ja Giorgio. Any movie buffer would enjoy this movie. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape now and then, and how better is it to do this than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? A must see!
