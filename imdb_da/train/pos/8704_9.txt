There are lots of crap coming out of Hollywood lately. <br /> <br /> A friend sends me movies every now and then, as a surprise, it's great. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and couldn't stop seeing it, it's a drama but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakepeare, had a superpower. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should notice the new Russian cinema, they tell stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a play. This is much like an Asian movie with a dark Russian twist. Didn't go perfectly, but nothing ever is. You know what the power is, but it is never explained or fully realized to the end. It becomes secondary to the feelings of history. I don't want to see a remake, it's too tough as it would, the Hollywood system would normally ruin it. Action is top notch around. Directing and camera work is way beyond most of the crap out there. Kudos to everyone involved and I will turn many people into this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, see it.
