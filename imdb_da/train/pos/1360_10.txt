This is one of the most popular movies of all time. Parker Posey's character is over-the-top entertaining, and the librarian motif will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked in books and stacks the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, rent this. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The audio track is also highly advisable. I've shown this movie to more library women than anyone else - they all fall in love with it.
