This animated movie is a masterpiece! The story, music, animation and history where all remarkable. My boyfriend and I saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it. We invited a couple of friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. When I asked them to come together to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but afterwards they realized it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek who remind me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles a lot in dancing with wolves. Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found empowering and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit the third time and I want to see it again. I enjoyed the "Spirit" tremendously because its depiction of American Indians is realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical as opposed to the movie "The Way to El Dorado", which was a total farce, because it depicted American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. But Dreamworks has redeemed itself by making Spirit a great movie that I thought was acceptable! I hope they continue to make more animated films like Spirit, and I would like to see followers or spinoffs for Spirit if it is done respectfully and without stereotyping American Indians. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend it to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the spirit: the stallion in the cimarron.
