are highlights of this 1917 feature. Clan's pride tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan leader after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple life of "fisher people". My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the movie boasts some amazing ocean views, and the camera's work on boats is great. Maurice Tourneur instructed Pickford in this cozy movie. Pickford was already a big star in 1917, and this film seems to be written only for her: A beautiful young woman succeeds in accident. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers towards church is very fun. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a good Picford movie, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest and is good as the strapping island boy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I couldn't see her either. My copy spans lots of bells and gongs and adds a creepy feeling when the village's alarm bell is ringing. Very effective.
