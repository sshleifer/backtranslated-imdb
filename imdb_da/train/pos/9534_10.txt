Acting This film is a very effective film. I would say that the performance is a little weak at times; but mostly the actor is very good. The only actor who blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was amazing! Tom Hanks seemed a little unsure of a few points throughout the movie, but he was also incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use this word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If you were to pause at any point in the movie, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He puts up every shot so there is nothing out. When the camera is still, there is a postcard quality for the screen. As the camera moves, each shot is scheduled to underestimate perfection. But it doesn't stop there. Conrad's choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he turns on is one of the most amazing light work I've seen. His work on this movie did what it was. This movie is at the top of the list for best filmography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. History People would say that this movie is a 1930s gangster flick, but I think they missed the point in the movie. It is a love story about a hitman who fails to try to protect his son from the life he chose. It is an excellently crafted story that unfolds in a beautiful bond between two people who only have one another. The screenwriter is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman scores a sad but hopeless score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and fluid scores I have crew. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a sense of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the notions he gets from his actors are rarity in today's film-making world. I will be looking for the next Sam Mendes movie. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
