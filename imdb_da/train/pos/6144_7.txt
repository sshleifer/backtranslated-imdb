I saw this when I was at The Wonderful World of Disney as a child, so I don't remember much about it. As I saw it recently, I was sitting there thinking, "This is the weirdest thing I've seen". <br /> <br /> The "travel" scenes resemble something caused by an overdose of LSD. The animated characters are mostly oddly colored / stamped versions of the Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some not-so-Disney stuff I noticed: kids are being threatened at the knife point and prostitutes (under the Portobello Road song). It was very entertaining, though the songs were long and I can see some kids bored with them. Also the academic way was a little dark when it was set during World War II.
