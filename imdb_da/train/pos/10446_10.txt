I watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video on average once a year. It's the type of movie that is timeless because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversation are so personal. It is also one of the very few movies that catch you from frame 1 to the credits, despite the fact that there are really only two (very involved) characters. This owes much to the engaging action of Hawke and Delpy, which makes us believe that they are actually Jesse and Celine. This is also the first movie I saw that mentioned reality reality TV, and now the phenomenon is fierce! I love the way this movie just encloses the audience in its space and makes you think, no matter where you are, you are one of those characters. It has also made me drive the train around Europe! I haven't met anyone who hasn't been able to relate to this movie. Maybe it's talking about myself, my friends or just the pure genius in this movie.
