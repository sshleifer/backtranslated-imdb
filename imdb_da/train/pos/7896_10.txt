This is an excellent example of early Bette Davis talent. Production is above average for the 1936 time frame. I can't understand why the owners of the rights to this movie haven't put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE please drop it. I wanted to buy it right away. I haven't seen it for more than thirty years on television, but remember it well.
