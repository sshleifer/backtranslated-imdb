With regard to visual beauty, this movie is excellent! I didn't know that Technicolor came out so early. Although I did not like the end, the whole movie is amazing and makes me wish I was in North Africa. Cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so prolonged and I just loved her in this flick. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I couldn't get over the landscape and the sets ... The hotel, the palms, the desert, it's all there ... the legionaries also bring a "Beau Guest" feel to the movie. They certainly don't make movies like these anymore. Don't see this classic!
