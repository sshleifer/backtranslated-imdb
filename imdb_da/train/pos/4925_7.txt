A nice 'race against time' priority - A murdered John Doe has been found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and the NOPD are hitting everyone and trying to find their waterfront contacts, the killers believe the heat is because the victim's infected cousin sticks to them . <br /> <br /> This movie is freely available from the internet archive and it is worth downloading. A lot (all?) Of this movie was filmed in real New Orleans places, making it interesting to look at what is now details in time, although it appears to be under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then were not what they are. There is also a lot of local background noise, which is a bit distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are many non-professional support artists in the crowd scene, and it can explain why the pacing of the movie is a bit saggy to begin with - not much chance of reopening or reworking, though the final hunt is worth hanging on. There is not much wrong with the main players: Jack Palance is really scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene when he alternately comforts and threatens the ill cousin is amazing, while Widmark, as he often did, places the righteous anger of the man on mission at a credible level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should recreate this - no supernatural, no mystery, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict and a current theme. Another reviewer mentions the author John Kennedy O'Toole, and it is spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types of peering this dark, sleazy, anti-the-clock drama. There is even a midget newspaper salesman. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community? D'du think you live in the Middle Ages?"
