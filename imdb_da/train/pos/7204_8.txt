It is a scene game adapted to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the dramatic home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a fabulously successful Broadway game, but his last 4 efforts have flopped - terribly. An aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who participated in a Sydney playwriting workshop, sent him a copy of the piece he has written. Sydney tells his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon), the game is fabulous - a safe fire hits. But is it good enough to die for? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> Smart dialogue and many twists in the plot keep this movie entertaining from start to finish. It all seems to have a good time. It's similar to another fun Michael Caine mystery: Sleuth. Worth to see. <br /> <br />
