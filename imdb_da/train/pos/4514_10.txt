I recently watched this movie in a lazy Sunday afternoon with my friend and we have a lot of fun! This movie is a masterpiece of the trash can. Try to see it for this purpose! Of course, this was not expected, but the performance of the players (and Alberto Tomba is definitely the best), the weak script and the low-cost budget had created a fantastic mix of foolish things. Tomba was just retired from alpine ski races, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two World Cups and nine World Cup titles. Serious about the director: No one knows why Damiano Damiani has signed this movie. All the other Damiani's directions are significant.
