What would you say about a man who was getting married and having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a Hawaiian guy? All smooth races until he takes his "bachelor hat" away. What do you want to say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if the exact girl was his cousin's cousin? A new low, right? Well Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, brings this experience of a nausea blur and a new low. I have to say that this is one of his good leading roles. But I think his role in Vanilla Sky was better done. <br /> <br /> His economy named Karen is played by the up-and-down actor Selma Blair, while Kar's character, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles. Getting back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with another problem. He gets illnesses, has to deal with some people and has to play his lies with passion, or any member of each family can get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who has not had a "bowel movement" " for 14 days. * Spy * All this leads to the long-awaited wedding with a fun scene before it recovers the whole hell that Paul and his brother had to go through. All in all, a Guy Thing is quite fun and is okay. The story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie, and if you're Canadian and a colleague of CTV Brett Butt sitcom, Corner Gas, you'll recognize a small role that Fred Ewanuick plays the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series. This movie is okay. It's another feather in Lee's hat (a pretty empty hat so far). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 / 10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
