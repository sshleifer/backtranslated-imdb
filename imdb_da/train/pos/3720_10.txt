Joel Schumacher made a great choice when he decided on this cast and this script. The story is well written and well laid out, and this brand new cast with 10 or 12 key characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed that there were 6 "leaders" and about half a dozen with support, and that is by far the best thing about the movie, the fresh young faces tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood has touched on the controversial Vietnam war films that say something about the "story to be told" (as shown by schumacher) and Tigerland landing in the handful of top war movies. But it cannot be felt as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the spirit of Bozz and the other people. I think anyone who just wants to watch a good movie out of all the special FX, but just good, gritty drama must go see Tigerland, of course Shumachers Best works for the past 8 years.
