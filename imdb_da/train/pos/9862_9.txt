Finally, I came to see the infamous "Ice Age". Aside from perhaps not being as dead fun as I had hoped for after seeing the glorious teaser, there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production (it's also Fox's first attempt at a full-length CG movie), but it has a huge heart and sometimes (like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see it sad glimpse of his past) I was on the brink of tears. But when they reunited the baby with their father, I just couldn't hold them anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clich√© and manages to bring out more than the best; The end result is one of the most touching animated creations I've ever seen. Great fun-looking characters that quickly grow on you (and also good talents) and many fun memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf, make the movie more than enough to give it a try. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite fun scene in 2002. <br /> <br /> I honestly do not understand it, but for some reason it looks as if CG animation will take the lead in the future. But if it just means there will be more movies like this (and who can forget about Pixar's creations), then I don't mind, at least for now. 9.10
