A realistic depiction of young love for the college, but also appealing to an older viewer like me. It has up and down and turns and made me throw a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that can appeal to older, non-black audiences and show a more realistic picture of young black adults. This film takes place on a university campus and city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background, different friends are acquainted and situations that affect them for better or worse. Typically, some may say, but this was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationships when I saw my own past in their history. Moments of deep thought and revelation came out of the actors' notions. <br /> <br /> It is a bright movie that I would join in for the youth of the heart and in love or ever fell in love. Great film. I'm looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
