As a pagan, I must say that this film has suffered if there is any magic meaning. It's a "fun" witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest Magick of all and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way. It is a lesson that everyone needs to learn, not just the Gentiles. <br /> <br /> As said, this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold delivers a great show like Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention except as Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was wonderful as Mrs Novak's absent, yet skilled on top neighbor Queenie. Also starring Jack Lemmon (wonderful performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliant twig). "Witches can't cry. Why can't they throw a single tear because their heart is full of Magick. Don't have time for stupid things like love." Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches. Dressed deep within the secret underworld of the craftsmen, they live among others New Yorkers as one of them, without so much as causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But also comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a firm, no-nonsense, dedicated businessman engaged in getting married to Gillian's old college rival. <br /> <br /> By chance, he finds himself in Gillian's building and is immediately "spoiled" by his charm and grace. Using Magick, Gillian begins with a little help from the Pyewacket (Gillians well-known, educated by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie to work on this beautiful new dream man to get back to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control or hurt, and Gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way. Not only must she face what she's done, but she has to meet Shep for her sake. <br /> <br /> From the critical perspective; But the film takes a serious trip: the effects are very dated to be pure camp. Some of the landscape was apparently shot in the basement of others' little home, but at least the characters were quirky and funny. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, the Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! Good training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a Note of Trivia, this is the root of the beloved Bewitched television sitcom. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All the letters are present and counted. Just look to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I often see it. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9.1 / 10 off. .. <br /> <br /> Enemy:
