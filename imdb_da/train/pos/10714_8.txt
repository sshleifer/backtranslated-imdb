The shot is distinguished by the story. The traditional sorting. Many years after the event, I still see in my eye an older lady, my friend's mother, telling the Battle of the Culloden. She makes the signs alive. Her passion is an eyewitness. One for the events on the hot heath a kilometer or from where she lives. Of course, many years passed before she was born, but you wouldn't guess how she was telling it. The same story is told in the columns the length and width of Scotland. As I discussed it with a friend one night in Mallaig, a local cut in to give his version. The discussion continued to shutter speed. <br /> <br /> Stories devoted to this become part of our being. Who can't remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become our invisible world. And as we get older, they may still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir. Facts and fiction are mixed with aspiration, role models. Warning Stories. Archetypes. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, as my grandfather and his grandfather in front of him." Our main character introduces us to us. And also introduces the story that goes back through generations. It produces stories within stories. Stories that evoke Scotland's impenetrable marvels, its rugged mountains hail in mists. Things in the legend. But Seach'd is rooted in reality. This gives it its special charm. It has a tough beauty and authenticity, tempered with some of the finest Gaelic songs you will ever hear. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather at the hospital shortly before his death. He is burning with frustration. Part of him longs to be in the twenty-first century to hang out in Glasgow. But he grew up on the western shores of a gay-speaking community. <br /> <br /> But there is a deeper conflict in him. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind his grandfather's old stories. Where does fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind his parents' death. <br /> <br /> He is drawn to make a final fateful journey to the top of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can the truth be told? Or is it all in stories? In this story of stories, we regain bloody struggles, poisoned lovers, folklore of the old, and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth. In this way, we each connect with Angus as he lives the story of his own life. Seachd: The inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and truly beautiful film ever made in Scotland. Like Angus, I was a little annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories about several stories. But like Angus, I forgave this when I saw the 'bigger picture'. Forget the box office pastiche of the Braveheart and its like. You can even leave the just famous dramatization of The Wicker Man. To see a movie that is true for Scotland, this one is unique. If you may meditate deeply enough, you can even re-evaluate the narrative ability of history and the old question of whether there are any truths that cannot be told but only experienced.
