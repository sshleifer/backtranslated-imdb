I rarely ever encounter a movie, so I completely meet that I must immediately talk about it. This movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and is very authentic. I happened to see the copied version, but I'm on my way right now to get the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. Yet the dubbing did not get in the way and sometimes gave some really funny humor: "Poison Clan Splashes the World !!!" The storytelling remains true to Chinese methods of intrigue, excitement, and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists as the identity of the 5 venoms is revealed and an expert pace. Martial arts battle choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen as being believed. It's like seeing real animals fighting each other, but interpreted from their own path-shaped martial arts forms. Such a level of cast skill is unmatched in modern cinema. The combination gives a serious dose of ancient Chinese culture, and I recommend it solely on the basis of the film's true intention to tell a struggle of art history and mastery of its implementation. ... Of course, if you just want to see people huddle together with raw forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
