First of all I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original movies I've seen so far; showing a Cambodian poverty lifestyle background. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) walks around and kills people to survive himself; has done it throughout his life. Sam Lee's (Wai) duty is to capture the Cambodian good. There are tons of violent acts but have a good story for it. The film shows the fighting between the two characters; they both beat each other like angry dogs. GO AND SEE PPL ... BIG SUCCESS !!! (GO HK FILMS)
