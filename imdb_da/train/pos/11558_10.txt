"The Odd Couple" is one of the movies that far exceeds its reputation. People all know it, they lobster the theme song, they complain about living with a sloppy "Oscar" or a cunning "Felix" ... but they sell the movie without knowing it. It's not just about a nice guy who lives with a sloppy guy; It is a portrait of two friends who help each other through the disgrace of the divorce. It is also wonderfully fun from start to finish, but it is the kind of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful and just horrible situations. So some viewers have actually found the movie to be a little uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength. In addition, Matthaus's bulldog just cracks me up! My favorite comedy, by a country mile.
