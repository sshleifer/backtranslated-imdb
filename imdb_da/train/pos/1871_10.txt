I was adopted at birth and had definitely not the problems Antwone Fisher had in the movie, but I still share some of the emotions, and this movie really helped bring them out and force me to handle them. It has even made me realize that I have a "missed piece" and I have to search for my grandparents now. <br /> <br /> I cried almost a day after I saw this first time. Antwon's confrontation with his maternal mother is equated with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our birth parents. And his self-confidence and self-affirmation for his mother and against his past abusers was so powerful. I really could identify with this and my need to tell people "yes, I was set aside by my parents when I was born. BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me. And now I'm a success!" <Br /> <br /> It also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children who went through tragic experiences before coming to our home. And it helped me realize how terrible our social system is. If you remember reading the story last year about the foster child in Florida, who was "lost" and then the "Miranda & Ashley" story in Oregon City, where the SCF ignored several sexual assault charges about the man who ultimately killed them and the week this film was released, another story in New Jersey of three children ignored by the system. One dead. The state seemed to seem that the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are just so many issues brought out in this movie - and they are handled so well by the script and by the actor that Antwone Fisher must be a "Best Picture" nominee for sure. Whether you are adopted or not, it is a heart cutter that cannot be ignored by anyone worried about children in our community.
