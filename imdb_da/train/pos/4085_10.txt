If you were born around the time this movie was finished and had a liberal / open minded household that I had, I am sure that in the early 80's you were first introduced to join your parents and look at dirty movies or extreme dirty movies. You don't know 100% pornography, but rather an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or that you slip into their collection and pop up in the plastic rectangle of such a movie in a big dookie machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet and ninja like, but have less and less heart failure when big pop sounds were made when you tap tablet-like buttons for fear of being discovered. Whatever the case, such films were sent back in waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual "art". Needless to say, this film fits into the above description to a "T". Many people will comment on the film's extreme sexual character, but perhaps because I am desensitized, I am more disturbed by the subtleties. Where the creator speaks to us at deeper levels of human sexuality, or what could be regarded as a true abomination, interracial relationship, imposturbation, voyeurism, or might it be desperation for social status to the point of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality or the suppressed sexual of social elitist women in the 18th century France? Who can say, but in spite of Mr. Borowcyzk's taste for living, raw sexuality is the "norm" for his works, I would say that this film actually speaks to the viewer at a deeper level regarding bestial carnality. When I learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value, and well worth checking out.
