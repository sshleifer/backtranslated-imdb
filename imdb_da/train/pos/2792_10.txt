I love this movie. It is great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist issues such as. Girls who want to play sports previously reserved for men. It shows the struggle for both an Indian person who wants to break outside his cultural barriers and women who want to break beyond the gender limitations found in sports, especially in England at that time. I feel that the cultural struggles are more stressed than the other problems. Unlike the other comment, I don't think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick flick. This movement is loved by many types of people, men and women, both young and old.
