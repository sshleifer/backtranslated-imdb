I just found IMDb and searched this movie, and I was moved almost to tears of comments from all the people who saw this movie as I did then 6 or so years old in 1967? I saw it before Jungle Book, so I was Eagle Boy for a couple of hours and then Mowgli for the next year. I burst into tears in the cinema when the boy became Eagle and always wanted to watch the movie again. When we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and I got the wish and guess who I wanted to be? My father then said 'I bet you wanted to be an eagle' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses then more tears and a little anguish to this day so as not to fly away ...
