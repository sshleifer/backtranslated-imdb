For other viewing of this movie, I like it even more than the first time. It is full of shades and a perception of life as being quite common and often horrible, but what raises this movie to a height that is rarely realized is its focus on the small cases of our lives that we usually only offer the shortest attention spans. Here the film jumps into the celebration of these episodes, the meeting with a truck truck driver and client, and the jogger hears a child's cry from the bushes. The dialogue, action, casting and direction are excellent. No two at four, no great revelations. What I observed was how true the signs were to their basic nature and how improved their lives became when they were celebrated. Kudos to everyone involved in this, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10
