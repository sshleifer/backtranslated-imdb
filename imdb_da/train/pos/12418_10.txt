This movie and the sequel Barry Mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies ever produced. A great story raises a young Aussie blocker to England to assert her legacy and meet his fellow players who are as lovable and innocent as he is. It's shocking a block full of big words, where else can you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he is as dry as a dead dingoes dung? big figures, top-performing, and it has beautiful sheilas and more Promotes consumption, then all other three films are combined. Top heel. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear, and full of celebrities. Certainly my two favorite movies all the time, I see them at least once in fourteen days.
