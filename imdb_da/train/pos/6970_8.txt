This is one of the movie's / pilots that if you knew BattleStar Galactica, it helps, but it's not necessary. What makes this even more credible of a story than BSG is that this is not so far away in the future. This has such a depth for it to be quite astounding that it was not released theatrically. The wires could not have been better selected in such experienced and rather talented actors. Eric Stoltz is great as the father who will do anything to be reunited with his daughter, but genuine or not, she is & he will do it regardless of the cost. Paula Malcomson of "Deadwood" fame is great as his wife too. You are not quite sure of his motives, whether it is love or money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more exciting. I see a star in the production of Zoe, played by the relatively unknown Alessandra Torresani & her performances. Esai Morales is amazing in his desire to see his beloved again and just how wrong to even consider what he wants more than his moral objections. I didn't think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but from pilot alone I am thrilled to see how we got to the BSG scene. It is great to see Adama as a child who is already influenced and influenced by the different kinds of robots that begin to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep up with the stories so we can figure out even more how to get the humanoid-type robots. This is an almost perfect pilot, and I hope they can keep up with the amazing storytelling. Even the visual effects are better than most of the waste you see on the big screen. If you haven't got BSG, @ try it the least, and I bet you will be a fan and will see how the BSG story came to be.
