I am disappointed with the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's "Blow" Writer, Governor and Star. <br /> <br /> I won't give away any plot points that the movie (at least for me) was very exciting without knowing anything about it. If you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would wear it ... I highly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun and sometimes very thoughtful creation. <br /> <br /> Mollà's direction is * totally * impressive and shows many promises. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with stunning images and good management in beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" is a great movie you can show to your friends. See it.
