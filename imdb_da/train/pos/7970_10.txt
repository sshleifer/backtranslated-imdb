This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices of the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy cats and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real show is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Humorous and exciting, and guaranteed to make any animal lover crying! (happy tears!)
