I first heard about this movie about 20 years ago when I was a schoolchild (!), It just happened that I emptied through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and during the filming (or movie theater I can't remember), were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of those shown on the page was still for OffOn. It really fascinated me as it stood out most of the page (it was still from the movie scene with the eye with other elements superimposed). About 18 years later, the public library here where I live had available to checkout the entire 4-DVD set of "Treasures of American Film Archives" published by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I read the notes on the DVD cases to the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the disks. After all these years I could finally watch the movie! After seeing it, it was a little not what I expected to be (it was a more organic-looking movie, not that was a bad thing, but I expected to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive movie , IMHO, considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including hand-toning the movie itself and using video equipment for some of the movie's scenes (filmed by a video monitor), giving it a more disturbed, lo-res look . <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, the techniques used in this movie were quite groundbreaking in 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite cards / experimental films and a creative inspiration to me too ...
