Bromwell High is a comic book comedy. It ran alongside some other school life programs, such as "teachers". My 35 years in the education industry makes me believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than "teachers". The struggles to survive economically, the insightful students who can see through their pathetic teachers' pumps, the rudeness of the whole situation, remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode where a student repeatedly tried to burn down in school, I immediately reminded ......... of .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to take one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that Bromwell High is a long way off. What a shame it is not!
