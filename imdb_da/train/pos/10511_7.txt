"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but painting, joining her friends on her wagon up and down and saying hello to people in town and trying to match make everyone she knows . I suppose there were no movies, no television these days, and the girls had nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read a little more. I like Gwyneth and think she's a lovely young woman. She is talented, and in "Emma" you have the privilege of hearing Gwyneth sing. I look forward to seeing "Duets" where she supposes to sing. She is brave to speak British English with all the native British, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and Funeral, Dancing at Lughnasa). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Really, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American film royalty, which is none other than daughter of director Bruce Paltrow ( St. Andrews) and Tony Prize winner Blythe Danner (The Myth of Fingerprints). She will hopefully be around for a very long time. Lucky us! I liked Emma and recommend it too. It's one of the old stories that are still accurate the days. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I like it when she sings a duet. Favorite Quote: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you didn't ask me to contribute a riddle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a mystery, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were overqualified." Miss Bates: "It left us speechless, pretty speechless, I tell you, and we haven't stopped talking about it since."
