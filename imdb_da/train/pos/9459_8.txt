I see some romantic comedies with hesitation, for romantic comedies have ancient clich√©s that make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a romantic comedy there is a girl, and there is a guy who both falls in love, so has problems and then wins over the problems of getting married or whatever. But this movie is another story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a widow (Dan) who is a girl (Marie). Dan meets with Marie in a bookstore and talks about sometime after Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this begins to make sense, we get a twist. Marie is his brother's boyfriend. Unheard of, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not only be possible. The way it is made forms the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell is doing well, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And all other things are done well. It's a good movie, see it.
