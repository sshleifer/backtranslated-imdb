Robot Jox does not suffer from history or bad effects. I mean, it was 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the films did through the 80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects available to them at that time. It was only until Terminator 2: Doomsday was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized and storyboarders began to use that motif. But you will have good memories from Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers if you see this movie. The enemy robot is very threatening. This means that you do not want to meet the man without a really good back-up plan. And there are some good moments in this movie. A traitor / spy works within their midst. Who you think is on your side and supports you all the way could be the person you didn't expect him / her to be. And it is very difficult to think about it, do you disagree?
