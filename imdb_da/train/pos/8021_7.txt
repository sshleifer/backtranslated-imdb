The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, as the band takes their modest college musical to the bright (yet fleeting) light of Broadway filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails, and Kermit (head of the group and the author of the show) blows his top; so the others all go their separate ways so he doesn't have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself is friendly with a young wannabe fashion designer that makes it possible to make ends meet by serving food on his father's dining room (the old one has a line in very weak non-sequiturs!). We get the usual cameo tree of a number of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an over-the-world dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a tramp), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (who even has her portrait in a classic restaurant replaced by Kermit's sporting fake mustache, as a seemingly famous entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (in possibly the movie's funniest scene as Broadway producer, for whom Kermit seems to be streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets go more or less through their typical steps, with (unfortunately) less space given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes where the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress ?? and especially her violent reaction to this ?? is unthinkable fun. What is disappointing, however, is the climatic show itself (after a fairly redundant mid section where Kermit gets amnesia and eventually captures advertising on Madison Avenue), which instead of the expected splashy routines buys nothing more original than Kermit's wedding ceremony and his eternal flame miss piggy!
