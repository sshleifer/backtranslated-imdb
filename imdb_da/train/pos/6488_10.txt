War is hell. But this documentary from World War II is heaven. <br /> <br /> Not only is this series a breathtaking, almost exhaustive look at World War II, it is a poetic masterpiece that is clearly and brilliantly told by Laurence Olivier. <Br /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It is mistakenly far beyond doubt, but you will enjoy them all and want to come back to more and more. (I have the series on DVD, and I probably see the series three times a year). It really is an impeccable bit of film making. Other than Olivier, the best part of the series listening to the veterans tells their stories; Whether it is a real blow or about finding a pig for butcher, so they can have something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I have to go see it right now (again, my ... 11th time).
