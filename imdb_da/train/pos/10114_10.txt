"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the final documentary about the life of the man who brought us movies like "Glen or Glenda", "The Bride of the Monster" and of course "Plan 9 from outer space". This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion" failed. It rounds off his surviving entourage, many of which have gone since the film and give an honest study of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back on the darker corner of the previous Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the joking music), this documentary is an absolute necessity for anyone who loves the director who so mistakenly in his day. A whole two-hour film lovingly and retrospectively surrounds Ed's life and unnecessary death for the viewer. Best seen at 3am while having an angora sweater.
