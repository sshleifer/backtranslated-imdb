Rented and saw this short (<90 minutes) work. It is by far the best treatment Modesty has received on film - and her creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees to participate as a "Creative Consultant". The character and we who love her are treated with respect. Mirror's direction is the best he has made to date, and the casting was very well done. The Alexandra City is almost physically perfect as a struggle for the original Jim Holdaway illustrations of Modesty. An amazing find by the one who threw her! Raymond Cruz as young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. will continue to do more in the series - I'm particularly interested in seeing who they would choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!
