I just saw detention last night, and I liked what I saw. It was a cool movie. Dolph looked great on the bike. He also looked good in this movie compared to his other latest movie. He is now in a pretty good shape. The story was ok, and the other actors were also acceptable. I wouldn't call this movie his best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But it also had its share of problems. The first was the way the balls fly everywhere, and even when they were fired on a blank range, they missed the goal. They should have shown that the plums relaxed the balls in a better way. Another problem I had was the way the students swear. I don't know in which school students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the evil guys were very few in numbers. There should have been more evil. Last problem was definitely the fact that the set looked cheesy but it was due to the small budget. Overall, the film was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I would recommend others to see it. P. S. Now you're a DEAD beat cop. (Some one-liners were also cool) <br /> <br />
