Buster shines completely in this episode, which is the only vehicle I have seen at the end of his career that allowed him to do the physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his gravel voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I don't care about Buster - but his ability to speak is still unsurpassed. He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reel with Roscoe Arbuckle. My deepest gratitude for Rod Serling to introduce us to this episode and to give Buster's genius full reach. He didn't have much time (an episode) to do so, but it's a soothing greeting to Hollywood's greatest genius.
