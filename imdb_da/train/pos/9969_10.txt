Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Big movies. But nothing, and I mean nothing lives up to the greatest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is so big and has so many messages, I cried while I saw it. Seriously this is one of the movies you have to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch being told, he should eat ice cream, we face sadness, and we feel the deep grief, and then we wonder ... What is so bad about this ice cream? Does that mean we as humans treat ice cream so well when all that is doing is making us evil? Think movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best version of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him captivating children and spying on the dreams of dreams, and we wonder; is Santa Claus we believe in really that good? Even this Santa Claus actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself to see this biographical masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. The one who says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.
