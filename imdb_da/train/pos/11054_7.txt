My siblings and I stumbled on The Champions when our local station aired again in the summer of the 1970s. We absolutely loved it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially compared to the usual American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not too much surprise as it was also British and spy / adventure genre). I would love to see it again now - hopefully it stops. I have mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I had imagined all of its existence. But the wonder that is the internet has allowed me to track information about it. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
