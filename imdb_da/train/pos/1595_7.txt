While I want to say that I enjoy the show, I expected something completely different than when I first saw 'What I like about you', I expected to find something like 'All That' (I'm not sure if that more), but I have to say that I like the show, and although I do not classify it as a breakthrough show, it is very charming, and I like chemistry between characters too (including the supportive cast) <br /> < I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy. I had also seen the woman who plays Valerie's friend in popular and while I thought it was an okay show, I don't really like her character in this show because she is just my cup of tea, but she rounds it well
