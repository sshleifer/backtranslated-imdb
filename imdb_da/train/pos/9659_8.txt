'Presque Rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experience of a young French gay. Eschewing both stereotypes and sermons, it is a wonderful naturalistic film, superbly acted, shot with a feeling for the seaside resort, where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully right. If that is something, it is almost too realistic, as there is little in the way of conventional plot, just scenes from a life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tensions counts for less than perhaps in a world so subtly drawn. 'Presque Rien' may not be the most exciting movie ever made; But its simple humanism serves well compared to the pre-determined festive or immersive views that often address this theme. Worth to see.
