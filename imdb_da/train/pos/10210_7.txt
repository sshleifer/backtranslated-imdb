This is not exactly a good movie, but I admire the authors and the director to try something different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In some ways, it reminds me of movie SLIDING DOORS, but instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random things occur repeatedly, and each one helps build the sweet conclusion. Plus, a strange bald guy seems to understand all this and he speaks of this during a short scene - as if he were some kind of omnipotent, but there is absolutely no explanation for him in the movie (like the two guys fighting each other in watch tower in HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The DVD jacket only shows Audrey Tautou. This is capitalizing on her success in AMELIE, although she is only one of many actors in the movie and there is no main role. The pace is lively, the fine though and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I didn't score the higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting, and I think the movie might be tightened up with a few minor subplots.
