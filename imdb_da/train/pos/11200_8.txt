This early movie has its faults - a predictable plot and some superimposed scenes of questionable relevance - but it already clearly shows Hitchcock's management of editing and the use of powerful images. It is also stylistically among the most expressionist of his film; Note, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the pictures. <br /> <br /> However, its core remains the last battle that is still among the more exciting examples of filmballing. Although you know that the hero must win, it becomes entirely credible that he will lose, and his wife's movement from the master's corner to his motivating final plot settlement is very well connected with the progress of the match. Stopwatch bets do exactly what they need; you can almost hear it ticking (although this is a silent movie, the pictures often have a surprisingly responsive to them). The pacing is surprisingly fast, and the viewer is sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the struggle and the sexual jealousy underlying it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I'm familiar with is Laserlight, a public domain company. As with every Hitchcock style they have released, they have linked various musical choices, most orchestrated, to the action. Sound editing is often sloppy, and the sound quality varies a lot, but some true care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final battle works very well; it is unlikely that this order will ever be better accompanied than it is here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive movie than the current obscurity would suggest. It deserves a reputable place in both the Hitchcock cannon and the narrow list of valuable boxing films.
