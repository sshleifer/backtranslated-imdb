I didn't know what to expect from 'Down Kelly' but absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and poignant. It also felt very authentic, I felt like I had been transported back to the 19th century. I've never been much of a Heath Ledger fan who only saw him in teen-type movies, but he's quite convincing in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, and shows us how a highly enthusiastic boy became Australia's most infamous killer. Naomi Watts is great in a supportive role as Kelly's community life. Highly recommended - and it's from an Aussie!
