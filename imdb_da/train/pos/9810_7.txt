Albuquerque is a movie that has all the elements of a class A western, except one: the story that really belongs to a class B or C. It was acceptable at the time the movie was made when people were so excited to see one Western in color, but today it just looks very primitive. Nevertheless, for people who enjoy old westerns, it is entertaining, the original color and sound are very well kept on the recently released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lon Chaney is mediocre as always, and Randolph Scott is a little more cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you would expect to see something that reminds you of the city, but the city shown here may be everywhere.
