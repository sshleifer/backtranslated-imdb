I enjoyed the cinematic recreation in China in the 1930s in this beautiful movie. The story is simple. An older male artist wants to pass on his art to a young man even though he does not have live children. The actors' faces are wonderful to see. The story reveals children's devotion and gratitude to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well. The operas in the movie remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when the children almost became chattel. The reason is a little predictable and a little too sentimental to me, but it is worth looking at for heroism, humanity and history.
