Having seen the "Batman Dead End" card, I didn't know what to expect from the world's finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All of my world's finest comics have them as team-up. After watching this 3 and a half minute trailer, it made me want someone to make a serialized movie for the world's finest, if not a full-length movie. Of course, some of the Superman's stuff were cheesy, but movie theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the entire product. It seems that it needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> Other than instructor Sandy Colleras relative who plays a painful Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie was made, actors would be thrown to fit the bill for the movie, though I think Nina Kaczorowski would make a good Lois Lane, especially if you got the dialogue closer to each other. <br /> <br /> Good to see Clark Bartram wearing Batman's costume from Dead End, but it needs updating a little more and not being like 40s Batman with the 80s-90s leather jacket and cowl. His behavior is Batman-like, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just letting his eyes appear through the mask. I think the goal was to get it as close to the comic book as the movie person. Michael O'Hearn can't play Superman, period. He stands with a greasy look on his face, just saying "let me go." And the delivery of lines seems to be a problem with him. Overall, I would like to see a complete story and film based on this brilliant work. There were smokers about a world's finest movie that was made, and with the correct additions to the script, this could be. Hope more as this is done.
