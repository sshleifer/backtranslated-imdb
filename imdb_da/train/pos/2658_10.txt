Kubrick once again shows his amazing ability to make a perfect mood for a movie. Mainly through cinematography, but also through a brilliant score, he creates a chilling and harmless tone across the film and thoroughly sparks my spine from the start. It really is this flawless atmosphere that makes The Shining masterpiece it, in my eyes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A scary authentic portrayal of a mind game. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it is easy to look past the two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it contains the actor with the biggest name at all times (Scatman Crothers).
