SUNSHINE BOYS was the frightening 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simon's game about a retired vaudevillian team playing by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and were asked to reunite once for a television special or something. The problem is that the two still hate each other and have nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthaus nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility to make this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine for a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and it works primarily thanks to one of Neil Simon's better screens and excellent work by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the best supporting actor Oscar for this, but I think Matthau goes away with this movie with his flawlessly hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but did not stand a chance against Nicholson for a wing over CUCKOO'S NEST; But in another year, this was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau commands the screen, and there is no false note in this beautifully timed performance. The stage in which he auditiones for a potato chip commercially and cannot get the name of the product right is a classic. SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy that shines thanks to the invincible chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
