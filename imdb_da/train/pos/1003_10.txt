Another Aussie masterpiece, this dives into the unknown and the supernatural world, and it does very well. It does not take into account the great special effects that override American flicks, it focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot, like Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. It follows the story of a couple buying an old house that apparently was home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things start to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to transform into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8.10
