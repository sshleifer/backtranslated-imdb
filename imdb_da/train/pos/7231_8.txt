The usual cat and mouse music abounds until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink. He gets the bright idea of ​​torturing Tom without knowing it. The cat is clever and tries to do things to make him see 'Jerry', even if it is not reliable. Of course Jerry gets the Butch aka Killer aka Spike dog in action (though it's late on cards and his contribution is minimal actually) Brilliant animated cards which kind of reminded me of it with the white mouse that scares Tom so much. Most gags work and all violent like any good empty and jerry card should really be. This hilarious cartoon is available on the disk one of the Spotlight Collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My character: B +
