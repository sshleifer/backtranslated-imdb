Two years ago I watched "The Matador" in the cinema, and I loved everything about this movie. Of course, I was totally under the impression of Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV, so I looked a little further on it. Now I can say with certainty that this movie is not so special, but you just have to "love it because of a man. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Brosnan lifts his character with amazing performances by Julian Noble, tired hit man who has no friends. Soon, Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man with mishaps: his son died in an accident, his job is not so good, and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). br /> <br /> I've always seen movies like this; crime film with a great touch of humor. Mostly, the humor comes from Brosnan when he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d .... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the navy left city." Brosnan says it with his charm while he usually drinks his margarita. I also like Greg's typical American face 'Kinnear in the role of loser who is very lively created because there are lots of people like Danny Wright. So I recommend you to see the best role as Brosnan ever. He makes you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in just as big a movie.
