I liked The Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. She looks good and she has really good eyes. What do you dislike? The scene where she is raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was a bit rough and cruel. In fact, a lot of things happening in this movie are rough and cruel. But it's a fuzzy movie. A lot of movies that are unclear are not too bad. I liked it better than the choice of the puppets, which was not only blurry but boring too. At least it wasn't boring. <br /> <br /> Pia becomes very naked and seems to be a writer. Seeing her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times his age is flat unbelievable. I'm sure Pia is a lovely person in real life, she just doesn't project the author's mood. She looked much happier when she worked as a host for that Saturday Night Fever guy wearing a sparkling disco dress. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are fun. The one where she tells the two-timing actress that she is pregnant, and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to "stop hanging!" All the time he goes almost every bimbo flying by. <br /> <br /> Pias nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it (vortex of floating faces and the freezing chamber scream - whoa!) And her subsequent catatonic stupor is a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The acceptance language is a hoot, though. I want to see someone make it talk in a drama class. <br /> <br /> But again, that's what we're talking about. You could find worse on any movie this week back in the eighties.
