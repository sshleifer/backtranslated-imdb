THE JISSE: See something else. <br /> <br /> This movie was rated by Gene Siskel, but after seeing it I can't figure out why. The film is absolutely original and different. It even has an interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments and a creepy "noir" feel. But it's just not entertaining. It also doesn't make much sense, in plot, but especially in character motivations. I don't know anyone who behaves like these characters do. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult movie to take on - I suggest you don't accept the challenge.
