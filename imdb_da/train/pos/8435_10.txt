Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that were not entirely true to character, this was Classic H: LOTS. The characters outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were true to form, and Pembleton (Reunion Scenes) by Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were so deep and well-behaved as ever to reach the small screen . /> "Homicide: The Movie" aka "Life Everlasting" is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job of pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and each major cast member of "The Best Damn Show on Television" together for the series finale, which NBC never bothered to give it. True to "Homicide" form, there were no happy endings, such is life. That's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter police showing on television. Kudos to the authors and cast to create something during the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a "homicidal maniac" if no other reason to keep my colleagues in a cooperative mood. **
