Wonderful family drama / comedy with MacClaine and Garr entertaining and warming the heart every time I see it. Highly recommended for all ages from 9-year-olds to grannies. Lovely period piece prisoner in 1962. The story includes the fighting Garr, her two children and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to make the ends meet without a man like the house head. The "family" leads west to take the legacy of a long forgotten family who have left Garr a round, ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late 1940s. The patient Garr, as the sweet but firm mother, gets the whole family to restoration and opening of the cafe. But wait ... Aunt Zena is an old circus artist with short tricks, magical powders and a humorous humorous ...... she loves to get the kids and her into stupid and sometimes dangerous games ... .. What happens next time is a nice combination of "Miracle at Lords" thrown with the Cuban missile crises (with authentic television news from the real event) and a "ghost" prank that gets out of hand. This film entertains, philosophises, questions questions about religion, and gives an unpleasant glimpse of the frightening scare of October 1962's Cuban missile crises. In the end, you are back with wonder of faith, family and rediscovered love. Oh, and the music from the early 60's era is just amazing! <br /> <br /> Recommend STRONGLY as a FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out of 10
