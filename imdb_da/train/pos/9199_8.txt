The game is basically "kill 30 people, find switches to open door.kill 50 people, find switch to open door" over and over until the level is complete. There are also fun mini-games like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a nightclub so Jack can get to another area of ​​the club or bomb disarm. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is also a tough game. You are put in an area that swarms with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a gun. When at the end of the game the skills become dust and you have to rely on luck. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is as ugly as it is difficult. If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot, the blood will split on the walls, ceiling and floor. And since there are more guys in each area, the walls are painted in blood. Family fun for everyone.
