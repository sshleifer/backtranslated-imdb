I think it's a nice family movie. There are lots of fun scenes and heart warming moments to be had throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effect is well executed. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who manages the horrible baseball team "The Angels" and is amazing throughout the movie. Also amazing are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are amazing in this top-notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie that everyone should enjoy.
