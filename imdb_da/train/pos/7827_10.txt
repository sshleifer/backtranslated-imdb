This movie is simply brilliant. The cinematography is good, the spectacle outstanding and the story is amazing. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who believed himself liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, I recognized him from Kline's account. Denzel Washington is also a masterful achievement ever. <br /> <br /> I urge you to see this. It's a long time, but it's worth patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, people, this really happened.
