"Groove Tube" was one of only two Ken Shapiro movies, the other being as many "Modern Problems". This is just a full-scale parody of television. Apart from Shapiro - which apparently did nothing after "Modern Problems" - the movie also stars Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in different sketches. One of the funniest ones has Chase in a Geritol spoofing advertisement, describing the drug as his wife's strips, and it ends up bumping him. There is also a pornographic news program, an annoying cooking show and the epic tale of some drug dealers. Still, it's all just a real hoot. In my opinion, the three best TV spoofing movies are this, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I might also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what ever happened to Ken Shapiro.
