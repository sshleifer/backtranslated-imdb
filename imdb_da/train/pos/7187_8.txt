Comics were short subjects originally shown in theaters associated with a feature film related to the mass magazine serialized fiction. Known as "chapter player", the extended movie images were broken up into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter will be screened at the same theater for a week. The series would end up with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest dangerous situation from which there could be no escape. The audience would have to return next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and fight the villain again. Series were particularly popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical movie theater included a chapter with at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, news and two feature films. <Br /> <br /> The golden age of the series was 1936-1945. This was one of the best in the era. <br /> <br /> Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ("The Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was excellent in the role. <br /> <br /> The action is constant and we are headed chapter by chapter to the final end, where we find out the identity of the evils. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs as he always does.
