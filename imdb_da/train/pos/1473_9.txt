Remember that any movie (let alone documentary) that claims any kind of truth will generate a negative and proportional amount of cynicism, from whom any suggestion or search for truths is already meaningless, those of you who are already Masters of psychology, movies and captains of the soul will undoubtedly find this film superfluous. You already know what is known. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority like myself, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" .... mostly brilliant and worth looking at for those interested in film, psychology and modern philosophy . <br /> <br /> Like Scott Mcloud's "Understanding Comics," Sophie Fiennes leads, the Slovenian philosopher, psychologist, and social critic Slavoj Zizek grabs into many of the films and specific scenes he discusses. The cover is a picture from "The Birds" (Zizek takes a boat out to recreate the shot). Lacanian Psycho-analysis, does not necessarily frighten an evening of fun ... but it is! If you like movies that are .... Having some knowledge about the Lacanian psychoanalysis helps (Symbolic, Genuine and Imaginary) are terms that are first thrown around a little, but the scenes that Zizek chooses and analyzes do it Remarkably clear it was always for me, a very abstract subject. In fact, it is probably better to have knowledge of the films he discusses than with the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer when the film continues. <br /> <br /> Why I love this movie is not because it captures great movies to analyze or reveal great truths about Lacan, but shows in a very practical and clever way where movies and psychology (and standard philosophy) meet . Why is "Sound of Music"? why is "Short Cuts" more than just class and alienation, why attack the birds in "The Birds", what is there to learn about the mind of "Alien Resurrection" what does the planet of "Solaris" want, what has "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" to do with each other, and what the hell is David Lynch across in film after movie ... Now Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voices in both "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith" is perhaps the strongest and clearest moment of the movie when he enters female sexual subjectivity. At one point Zizek admits that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentate that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children (fun, it looks, but ...). <br /> <br /> Yet, it is a fascinating documentary that anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant something more than literally stated should make an effort to see. <br /> <br /> And anyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, this is also a must, far less dry than "the reality of the virtual", and more directly than "Zizek!", two other pseudo-docs about " Elvis of contemporary cultural criticism "as he is dubbed, in the English speaking world. <br /> <br /> "Perverts Guide to Cinema" is NOT about the role of sex in cinema. Zizek argues that the cinema is the ultimate pervert art because it teaches "how to want and not what you want" and that it is the only contemporary art form that can enable them to be articulated. It's not a movie about finding the reality in the cinema, it's about finding the cinema in reality, and how important and exciting it can be. Hard to find, and a bit long, but worth the trouble, one of the most "stimulating" movies that look at the experiences I've ever had.
