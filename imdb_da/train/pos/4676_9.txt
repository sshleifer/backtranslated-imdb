I found this movie thoughtful and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of fast fix movies where we are manipulated to love the "good guy" and hate the "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very nice television actor, does a good job of portraying the black sheep / lost child who strives to get his father's love and respect, as well as his sister-in-law, as he apparently has a story. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good picture like a father who triangulated his sons, and now he is back with the one he always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition as explained by the director. <br /> <br /> This is an appropriate sequel to the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized that Judd Hirsch was too!
