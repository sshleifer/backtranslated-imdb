The wonderful urban Ronald Coleman is shown here as in few of his films. He is literally in all stages, and this comic film remains healthy because of him, not in spite of him. He is beautiful, witty and very nice here as he is one step ahead of his wandering, lovely wife - played perfectly by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French game and brings all the best qualities of the farce. Most of the support molding is well-known, at least by face, if not name ... and is perfect for this very funny movie. The wonderful Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he gets one step ahead of the other characters. His multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon" that any movie bird must see.
