When Douglas MacArthur hit more human lives for the better than any other American non-elected president, he deserved a better cinema cinema. Not that Universal's "MacArthur" is bad. It's just not all that should have been. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the potential was there. From the very early "Star Trek" episode "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the latest HBO films "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent emerged as one of The most expressive human instructors in film, a man who is able to subtly shape the emotional shadows of his actors and imagine the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films, and Universal widely asked that the film was "four years in preparation and production." Still, "MacArthur" is perfect enough and not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The movie begins in early 1942, shortly before the besieged general was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy)? To escape the Philippines to avoid being caught by the Japanese. Thus, this movie excludes: <br /> <br /> The birth of MacArthur in 188O in a border disaster in Arkansas, still subject to Native American tribal attacks, thus stating that his remarkable life spanned the distance from arches and arrows to thermonuclear weapons ; <br /> <br /> · his West Point exam ?? first in a class of 95, how he stayed with his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the medal at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on missions in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · His heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · how he ran around the wars of World War I as a mountain, often wounded and promoted with dazzling speed to Brigadier General; <br /> <br /> his post-war service as the West Point's youngest and most progressive commander; <br /> <br /> his participation in Billy Mitchell's court fight in 1924; <br /> <br /> his 1932 flight of Bonus Marchers; <br /> <br /> His efforts to maintain a fierce under-funded army as chief of staff in the early 1930s; <br /> <br /> His US Army retirement to become Field Marshal (!) of the Philippines army <br /> <br /> · and reactivate his FDR commission shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /> <br /> All this is left out for the benefit of long-standing recordings of MacArthur trying to combat marine disease while being evacuated by PT boat ?? So we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; Nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so hurtful to "Dugout Doug"? And so obviously unfounded. The rest of his career is actually straightforward: His salvation "Hit" them where they are not "campaign, the fulfillment of his promise to the Philippines" "I must return!" 锟 斤 拷 his crown performance, winner of the peace of post-war Japan, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a real feisty Ed Flanders) over the behavior of the Korean conflict, which resulted in his direct shot, and finally, his proclamation to the congress, that "old soldiers" simply fade away, then he just did it. Everything quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of comments. <br /> <br /> Sargent and manufacturers are almost painfully reluctant to join historical records with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions seem noble, let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic, let these conceptual registers comment. When Joe Sargent is the right expert on subtly manipulating his audience's responses ?? again, see Warm Springs ?? This refusal to offer comment seems quite intentional. Historically, it can be commendable, but it almost defeats the seers' efforts to place this extraordinary man in any rational perspective. And finally there is a kind of "made on the cheap" feel to the movie, as there is "Midway", released around the same time. Both films were referred to television directors - Sargent in this case Jack Smight on "Midway" and both have a TV look. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march, while perfectly customizable, lacks the subtle undertones and grandeur of his "Patton" theme - just another way in which a greater than life is memorized by a very ordinary movie. <br /> <br /> There was vanity and pettiness in this man, scary; there was also greatness ?? and love him or deceive him, one must admit that MacArthur did what no military commander had done before him: he won the peace. <br /> <br /> Finally, "MacArthur" as so many movie biographies became a great place to begin exploring this remarkable man, but a bad place to finish it.
