I've only seen IPHIGENIA once almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me since. <br /> <br /> A sequence remembers in particular, and could only have been shaped by a great instructor, which Michael Cacoyanis is undoubtedly. Context: The weight of history and a mighty army and fleet are all on King Agamemnon's shoulders. An act of sanctuary has fought the oceans and threatened his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he will sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo to get the wind to the thousand ship sails. He initially opposes but comes around and tricks his wife Clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, find out about victims and anger at the gods of protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discover that his name has been used in this deceptive, eerie way. He climbs on a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> The shot: The camera orbits the two youngsters without looking directly at each other. They apologize for the fate and weakness of men who deceive their loved ones and desire war. Suddenly they look at each other, and for a moment we feel both their power and beauty, and the undisputed - except of the camera - irony that in another time, somewhere, they might love each other and be married. It's a sharp and sad epiphany that only lasts for a moment. <br /> <br /> What direction! Which camera! What storytelling!
