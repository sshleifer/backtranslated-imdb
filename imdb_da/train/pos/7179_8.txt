It is reminiscent of Stephen King's writings and they housed childhood filled with terror from stories like IT - as the opposite. There is no terrain in these childhoods that any of the friends - still friends 20 years on the line - remember or seem to suffer. Up the whole line, it is described as friendly jostling, perhaps periodically described as "picking" on one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * anxiety * embedded as the film, and the participants in later life describe the relationship - all we see are young people grown up to be virtually the same people. More mature, but still almost the same people, and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Amazing! Not only for the fact that people can actually grow relatively scary of social conventions - but also that friendships can actually last. In this regard, this film is a little gem - assuming this has been the intent of the movie: A portrait of undisturbed emotions that bind people together. As opposed to recent years' films showing the dark sides of childhood, the violent impediments in Bowling for Combine are what can easily come to mind, but since the mid-80s along with the growing worship of children and childhood (accompanied by Thousands of advertisements, animations and series directed at children), several movies and documentaries have been successful in portraying the dark sides that grow up - the abuse, the loneliness, the pushing to excel, resulting in adults with darkness and winding minds. /> <br /> And here comes a movie that says: It is possible to have a happy childhood, see it! <br /> <br /> Thanks for that. OR the counterweight illusion ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
