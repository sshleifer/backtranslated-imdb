The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. It expressed human emotions and was an inspirational story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand that it was perfect for kids) and was sometimes fun and humorous. There were a couple of charged symbols to search for. The kinematics were acceptable. There was no sense of experimenting that many filmographers have made today (which quietly is getting a little warning). It was clearly filmed but had a good soft quality for it. Although editing could have been done better, I thought it was a good movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you, which was something I didn't like either, but on the whole it was a good movie.
