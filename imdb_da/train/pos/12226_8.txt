This is the best TV movie of all time! Can I say this because I'm a big Silverstone fan? Partly, but even without her, I still want to see it. I am a fan of serial killer genre films and believe this is a good entry into that category. Also Mary Giordano is easily positioned among Alicia's top five character creatures. Absolutely memorable - just as she really exists. I wanted her on my side too, if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character she does with her real life, with full confidence in everything she does. Seems sweet, honest, lovely ... just like she is in reality. So is it to act? Yes, yes, she is a kind of rebel again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a little scared to do things that seem over the law. But she does not do things that the normal teenager would do. Instead, she uses her time to read detective magazines and solve crimes. A clich√© abounds: she is a kind of renunciation of her father's death in a way other than vigilante style. At that time, Alicia seemed to play the same characters: rebellious, seductive, parentless, lonely. This also happens here, but this time she is a little nerdy. It does not mean anything; she is still cool as a geek. Check this out soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you didn't ...
