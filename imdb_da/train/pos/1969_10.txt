Frankly, I do not understand why this film has been such a big "flop" in advertising. Sharon Stone has certainly not lost any of his charisma and "touch" since the "Basic instinct". I voted this movie 10 and I tell you why: Games open in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events of BI1. Again she turns out to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class collection. She is "screwing your brain" like Catherine with such a skill, which in the end you are not quite sure who is the real villain. <br/> <br /> Regarding the technical part of the movie: Only true setbacks are the actors' B-rate crew. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. In the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was a little younger, but she is still amazing in her appearance and has only improved on her charisma. Her B-rate "assistants" are not that bad, even though I would have liked some bigger names on the cast. <br /> <br /> I think there are pretty good improvements in the floor plan. I think it's a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap Hollywood so easily benefits these days. The reason is great, it's easy to see technically, you don't wrap halfway through the movie and most importantly the moor is on.
