Well ... easy my favorite TV series ever. Call me a walking mail clich√©, but include violence, mafia, sex, games, drugs, etc. On a show and you already win points in my book. Combine all that with the actor who overtakes something you've ever seen on the small screen, adding directing that fits the vintage-style movie theater and most of all writing that blows the mind (and a few brains far) and you got yourself a show that becomes quite difficult to compete with. <br /> <br /> Above all, two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, fit his role in a way that words cannot express if you haven't seen him as tony yet, see it now! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on with every sign in the show, the psychological splendor, the moving scenes, etc. but you wouldn't be able to stop me, so all I can say is that it's all about it show with Seinfeld that I am able to see again and again from start to finish and end up enjoying it myself more.
