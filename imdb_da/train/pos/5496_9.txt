Someone has already mentioned "being at the right time in the right place". It was so true for this documentary that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and thought it might include some actions, but it is not. That's all right. History is nothing new to the people of developing and / or poor countries. It depicts man's manipulation of corporate media, misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating excitement on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence or even government (many believe, led by the United States) use agents who attacks "any" side to provoke the masses to violence and therefore justify their coups. A marine officer in the movie also mentions it. That they wanted to see the people confront the street. All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey (USA's Middle Eastern Pet Dog) throughout its history, which has experienced 3 coups, and lately secret plans from the Turkish army have been ironically postponed through a pro-government religious / conservative media contradiction. of the army's a-religious doctrines, where a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unique is that they filmed from within, perhaps randomly, when the events are happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. Whether this led to the directors filtering and manipulating the events and the information I wouldn't know. <br /> <br /> And whether Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the United States and the global economy without suppressing any conflicting thought of power and eventually becoming a self-reliant tyrant, the story tells. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hoping, and I think it's worth taking the chance.
