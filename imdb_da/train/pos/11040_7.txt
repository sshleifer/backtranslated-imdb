Watched this French horror movie last night and liked it. The entire film takes place in a prison cell with almost three prisoners finding a handwritten journal in a wall from a serial killer who had fled prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. When they look through the diary, they discover that it kills into the black art and commands that can be their way out of the cell and into freedom. What they find out is something completely different and terrible to say the least. I like low budget horror movies that deliver the goods in a pretty quality way and tell a good story. This movie does just that, although it takes a while to get started. The result and the horror they release is very interesting to me and I enjoyed the trip. Not a lot of gore, but it wouldn't fit the story, even though doing it is pretty good.
