The story is centered around Barry McKenzie, who will travel to England if he wants to claim his legacy. Being about the greatest Aussie shearer ever to set foot outside this great nation of ours is something of a culture clash and much fun and game ensue. The songs of Barry McKenzie (Barry Crocker) are highlights.
