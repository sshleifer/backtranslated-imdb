"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disruptive science fiction films of the 70s and still very convincing even to today's standards. Although deficient and slightly dated, the apocalyptic touch and environmental conditions (typical of that time) still feel very disturbing and thought-provoking. The film's quality level exceeds most modern SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. New York in 2022 is a depressing place to live, with overcrowding, unemployment, an unhealthy climate, and the total lack of all major food products. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in good shape) plays a policeman who examines the murder of one of Soylent's most prominent leaders, and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets ... Scripture is a little oversized at times, and the climax doesn't really come as a great surprise, the atmosphere is still very tense and rude. The Riot sequence is really awful and easily one of the most macabre moments in the 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role, and there is a large (but modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This is science fiction in my book: a nightmare and inevitable fad for humanity! No fancy spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
