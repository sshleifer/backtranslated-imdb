This stirring western spins the story of the early west's famous rifle, which was coveted by one and all. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout, only to lose it in a robbery. The story describes Stewart's practice of the rifle and a certain man through the film. The gun changes hands at a time, as if the owner is willing to lose it through violence. The picture has lots of action and excitement when Stewart shuts down his quarry. A great cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters is disappointed here, and the purpose of her role is quite unclear. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teen heartthrobs in recent years, have short but good roles.
