Baghdad's Thief is impressive in the form of the evil magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He plots with lies and magic magic to get the kingdom from its legitimate ruling young King Ahmad and a beautiful princess from his father ... He eventually falls as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and to it common man he ignored, here designed by the little thief (Sabu). The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms ... The scripture is poetic, simply and very beautiful ... The wizard's and his men's costumes rise and fall like wings of black birds and suddenly attack in night to cause destruction and create terror ... The brilliant hero wears white turbines and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues ... For spectacular scenes it matched everything that had gone before while using it color it made life a world as it had not been possible before ... <br /> <br /> With flying blanket and flying white horse, with a gigantic genius (excellently played by Rex Ingram) with evil guides and with the good play of Sabu and Veidt, "Baghdad's Thief" captures the Arabian evening's quality and true atmosphere ... <br /> The 1940 version is the screen's finest adventure!
