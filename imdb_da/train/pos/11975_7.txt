Full House is a great family program. But after seeing some episodes over and over, I have realized that they are incredibly boring, and they seem to live a lot from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it is incredibly cheesy. It's not like I hate it, but just don't look them over and over because they get old quickly. Probably the best season is the first. Full House is about widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. Then his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the girls' uncle Jesse (John Stamos) moves in with them. When they live together, they find that they cannot live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you of the importance of the family and that you can always come back home.
