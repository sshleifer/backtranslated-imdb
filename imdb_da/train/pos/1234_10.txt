I grew up watching this movie and I love it just as much today as when I was a kid. Don't listen to criticism reviews. They are not correct on this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit down with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone to watch. It's a comedy with a touch of imagination. With demons, dragons and a small bald child with God in power. This movie takes you from LA to Tibet, into the stunning views of the wonderful temples of the mountains of Tibet. Just a beautiful view! So go do yourself a favor and shake this one up! You will not regret it!
