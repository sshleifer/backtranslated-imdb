This is a way of cool fantasy movies. One of my faves, it's really that cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who continued to lead Candyman, he made a good start with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie about a girl called Anna who gets sick with glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream where the house is genuine. Each subsequent dream she has changed by the presence of what she adds to the image. In her third dream, she meets a boy, she thinks she has created called Mark. She turns to him and their relationship grows stronger as dreams become darker and frightening. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a great actress and it is very strange that after just one movie she has to disappear and never be in anything ever again. She really gives a good performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also Ace. Like Broken Arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. It's a shame that the audio track is no longer available on CD. The DVD is only available in R2.
