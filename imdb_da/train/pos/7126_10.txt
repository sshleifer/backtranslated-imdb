This film resonates with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and planted on unwilling hosts in a village. While I escaped the bombing and had experiences that produced valuable memories (for example, hearing a nightingale singing a dark night for the first time) and enjoying a life I could never have had in London, I missed my family and worried them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child are both dead and living alone in a small village. As an old man who is now without a wife whose children have been married and live far away in another province, I am once again lonely. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas of raising a child. When a deep love has grown between old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom is hunting for him and finally rescuing him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, there is great excitement, because, because of some bureaucratic rule, the child will lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
