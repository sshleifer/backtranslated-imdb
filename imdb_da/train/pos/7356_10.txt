If you haven't seen Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wives" then you miss out. Eva will be one of the greatest Latin stars, and you will soon see her in the theaters. This was Eve's first film, and she does a fantastic job. She was 24 when she shot it and so hot then. With regard to this low-budget film, it is pretty good for the first-time director who has another, soon to be released, film "Juarez, Mexico", currently playing at many film festivals across the US. In fact, it seems that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news. It would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
