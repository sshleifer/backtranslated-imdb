Of course, Rod Serling was a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left some of the time he lived and examples of television at this stage of development. There are no such shows now, but rather "Housewife" concludes ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful staffs of humor and witty junk that rattles our high-tech displays. Jack Elam lined up with episodes of such precision and with his insane misconception that I can't help but think Rod Serling was a long time ago tailor-made show around Elam, even though he was a supporter of the flow of history. This episode ends with a twist as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with especially "Serlingesque" dexterity. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
