The film has a great writing genre history. It contains all the usual Columbo ingredients; That way, Lt. Columbo approaches and binds to his suspect, the way the mystery unfolds to him, Columbo's dog, cat and mouse game, which is amazing in this and fortunately also a good soothing humor that mainly involves the Columbo character. It's written everything despite the fact that it doesn't even have a genuine original concept. Columbo hunting down a detective / killer novel author had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie. It is also an extremely orderly movie by James Frawley, who after this instructed 5 more Columbo films in the 70s and 80s. He delivered the movie in style and some really great and memorable sequences. It's one of the slower moving Columbo movies, despite not having too long. This style and approach does not always work well for a Columbo movie, but in this movie it does, which may not be the least thanks to the film's performances. <br /> <br /> Most Columbo films either star a great known star or star from the early days of film making as the movie's killer. This movie comes from the rather unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She didn't have a lot of movies throughout her career, but she is still known to some, mostly for her role in "Rosemary's Baby", which also won her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting that some might not like. It earned her 4 Oscar nominations throughout her career before she won "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. She also has a great interaction with Peter Falk in their sequences together. <br /> <br /> The movie also stars an ever-young GD Spradlin. I say young because I only know him from his latest productions out of his career, despite being already 57 at the time of this Columbo production. He is still alive, but retired from trading since 1999. <br /> <br /> An even better than usual Columbo movie post. <br /> <br /> 8/10
