It's rare for me to sit in front of the TV specifically to watch a particular program. It's even rarer when I actually enjoy the program in the end, but the last of Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I've seen. A remarkable cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, and an excellent, witty and sharp script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can't really say how well I thought it was, so I won't try, I just say if you get the opportunity, please see it !!!! I only hope it comes out on video.
