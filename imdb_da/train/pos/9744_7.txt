"Yes, Georgio" is a light hearted and fun movie / comedy that features beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I have enjoyed watching more than once. Some reviewers suggested, if you wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably be better served by collecting opera DVDs. Although a full opera may be a better representation of Pavarotti's operative talents, opera often requires costumes and stories that completely obscure the person's appearance and nature. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and display a personality and character in ways that an opera would not. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seemed to find the story incredible; I do not agree. Huge talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to capture intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get insight into themselves and grow positively from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions that they may not have chosen alone. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relation to each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself be in a visually and aurally rewarding movie with Pavarotti on top of his vocal abilities. Final scenes from Puccini's Turandot alone are worth to get there.
