I couldn't agree with the rating given to this movie and I think this is a sample of how short minded most of the spectators are around the world. Really ... Do you forget that the cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it just entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not so easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you hated it so much: because it's not trying to be comfortable for you. It's just a story, a very strange thing I admit, but after all it's just a strange story. It is not a good story, not even a great cinema work, but I think it is only worth having a 7-star rating for both the author's and the director's mind to make a story that is not made to satisfy the audience and thus sell billions of copies and make the big studios even richer. This film is for me European-artistic-like film made in the United States, and everyone involved in the presentation deserves respect. Be courageous or be exceptional in humor.
