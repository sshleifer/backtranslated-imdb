"CASOMAI" was the last movie I've seen before I got married, just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I've been looking for when I was married because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, reality is not that of fiction. For all those who wrote the priests as "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For everyone else I would only recommend them to watch this movie before and after "I do!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
