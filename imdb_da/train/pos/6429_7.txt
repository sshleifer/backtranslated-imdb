If the movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much more beautiful and evil than their Western counterparts. Storylines of the three Chinese ghost movies are pretty much the same, but the direction is excellent and detail and color are such that it is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the movie, accompanied by, of course, a lot of mugging. For those who have not yet experienced the 'Chinese GhostStory' trilogy, this film provides an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre; for those who have another enjoyable body in the Chinese ghost world.
