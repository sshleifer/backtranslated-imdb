I watched this movie years ago on sennat tv. Then it went with the title "Stairs to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply moved by the story and amazed by the visual effects of the trial (those who have seen what I am talking about). Such a fantasy! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and imagination. This movie is up there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it wasn't listed in the top 250 movies before I realized that so few have seen / rated this movie compared to those on the list. What a shame. I hope this movie will be released on DVD to Region 1 (North America), so 1) I can buy it and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
