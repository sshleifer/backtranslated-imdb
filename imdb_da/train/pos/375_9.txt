This was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I saw it for the first time, and when it is on TV, my eyes are glued to it. plays and plot are amazing. It works so true to reality, and it affects so many controversial issues. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
