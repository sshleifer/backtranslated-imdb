This is an entertaining gospel look presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and tells a little too. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is quite entertaining. Also note Jesus' blonde depiction in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blond hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all.
