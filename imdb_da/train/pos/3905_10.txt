witty. fun. intelligent. fantastic. I was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a fire was started. I got up late late every night and taped it for everyone I know. few. As 3 people out of the nearly 100 people I did look at, it didn't seem to be as amazing as I did. the others were laughing loudly so they were crying and thanking me at the same time. Please do yourself a favor. Don't run. see this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. It is a win-win situation. I wish I could have afternoon tea with him and meet the really rare comedian whom we, as a society, need more of .... sanechaos.
