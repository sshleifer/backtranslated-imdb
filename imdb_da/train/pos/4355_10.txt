I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent movie about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was fun, warm, exciting and moving, as well as entertaining. A movie like this would do very well with the word reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's just hope they get the chance. I would rate this movie as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It contains no violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so apparently distributors question whether or not to pick it up. Believe me, there are people out there who will love to watch a movie like this that has redeeming value, instead of the many typical big box office blockers we usually get.
