For many sources, this thought-provoking period lumps into drama in part on the basis of historical fact, along with the superficially similar "nunsploitation", which was a pillar of the 70's Euro-waste cinema overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole effort. Perhaps it was coincidental also director Gianfranco Mingozi's unambiguous attempt at narrative filmmaking without many well-received documentaries. <br /> <br /> Safely within a historical context, FLAVIA shows the growing rebellion of an Italian nun from the 15th century (Florinda Bolkan's career performance, even surpassing her talented work in Lucio Fulci's devastating), is not locked in the monastery by her not so noble father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's budding sensual nature. Wondering why women at best are referring to secondary roles in life as in sacred scripture, and she is confronted with ways in which male dominance can destroy female life, inspirational rebellion that provokes ranting of half-frightening older sister Agatha (indelibly portrayed by veteran actress Maria Casarès from Marcel Carnés READ ENFANTS DU PARADIS) and - more constructively - by a Muslim invasion. Along with the oppressors and perhaps manipulating them undoubtedly to make her bid, Flavia really becomes the outcast, she has already felt herself with expected tragic results. <br /> <br /> With its amazing widescreen compositions by Alfio Contini, who shot Michelangelo Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT, this is an uncompromising and rigorous account of a woman's tough but ultimately unintended struggle against the patriarchal society that does not gave her any rights beyond birthday or mockery as Sister Agatha's frantic remarks. A long medically-induced fantasy sequence, apparently modeled on Ken Russell's otherwise much more flamboyant DEVILS regardless, looks like the film is relatively clever in the skin department, making some of the mockery of its semi-pornography. This is a serious work that deserves rediscovery and restoration of its unfairly damaged reputation.
