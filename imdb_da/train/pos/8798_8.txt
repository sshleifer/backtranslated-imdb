First of all, I do not want to praise IÃ±arritu's short film, even though I am Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood. In another hand, I see most of the reviews focus on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle bottom line circling the entire collection, and maybe it won't be so comfortable for American people. (Although not the main purpose of the producer) <br /> <br /> What I am talking about is that most short films do not show the suffering that WASP people went through because the September 11 terrorist attacks, but other peoples suffering. <br /> <br /> Need proof of what I'm saying? Look, in the Bosnia short film, the message is: "You cry because of the people who died in the towers, but we (the other = eastern Europeans) cry a long time ago for the crimes committed against our women, and no one is aware of we as if the whole world has done for you. "<br /> <br /> Although the Burkina Fasso story is more in comedy, there is the same thought:" You are angry because Osama Bin Laden smashed you, but we (the others = Africans) should be more angry because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS long ago, and no one is aware of us as the whole world has done for you. "<br /> <br /> Now look at Sean Penn card: The case in the Twin Towers makes a lonely (and alienated) man happy. So, the message is that the power and greed (symbolized by the towers) must fall to let people see the sun rise and the flowers bloom? It is noteworthy that this awful bottom line has been suggested by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to being subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (well known for his anti-capitalism ideology) is much clearer and shameless about going straight to the point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but We (the others = Hispanics) suffer in the same way something worst, and no one remembers our grief as the whole world has done for you. " <It is as if the creativity of this project would say to the Americans: "You see now, America? You're not the only one who has been the victim of world violence, you're not alone in your pain and, by the way, we (the others = the non-Americans) a little more than you long ago so we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and by the way, we are sorry because you have had a little taste of your own medicine "Only the Mexican and French short films showed some compassion and sympathy for American people; the others are like a blow to the face of the US state, it is not equal to the Americans.
