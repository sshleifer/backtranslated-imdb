This review is dedicated to late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The Original Drum and Bass. <br /> <br /> There seems to be very little early who footage around these days, if there is more then it seems, today it tends to be of a completely different kind, which completely and a parody, a shadow of their (much) better year. To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone else, they have earned their respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert movie for me is one of their best. To order an audience of about 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, humor and a lot of bloody good music. We all know the other actions on the bill, The Doors (their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point was that whoever was there was who the majority had come to see. This show was a year after the 1960's great hippie party; Woodstock. The film and the album had come out and then The Who's biggest work to date, Tommy. The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste to be able to experience their own unique event in order to "Grove and Love" knowing that this concert was their own. To do this, you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungry cursed crowd. <br /> <br /> At 2 am at the end of August 1970, M.C. announces, "Ladies and gentlemen, a small Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherd's Bush London," OO. <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's body features are of black leather, the front is the end of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional dress of long tassel and long floating hair, Keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, which Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins, whom he preferred to wear. > <br /> Who has never stopped their attack on High Energy Rock for over two hours, performing their and other artist's biggest tracks like Young Man Blues, Shaking all over, and then queuing, Keith baiting crowed to "Shut up , it is a bleeding Opera "with Tommy, Rock Opera. Crowed went wild. This is what they had come to hear, and who didn't disappoint right into the Overture and never came to air until the final note of" Tommy Can you hear me? "Great. <br /> <br /> To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature At their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world, was a fantastic piece of cinema history. <br /> <br /> The English DVD comes only in a soundtrack of English / linear PCM Stereo, as in the US, I think you can get it at least 5.1, "Check local press for details ??" at that okay. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without additional features, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a piece of rock and festival history, this DVD will send you in a nostalgia ride down the memory track the moment you hit the game for some of the best Who Concert movies that were supposed to be Live, Raw and in your face ! <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5.1 and some extras would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
