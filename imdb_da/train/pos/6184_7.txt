As this is Black History Month, and I review the results of many African Americans on film in chronological order, I got this movie on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his orchestra were in it. Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the highlight of this predominantly murder-mystery-musical comedy mix. Many other songs I liked were Kitty Carlisle's special "Sweet Marijuana", Carl Brisson's "Cocktails for Two" and his duet with Carlisle on the past, and those of Gertrude Michael, which is great as the woman you love to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably go a little too long with their love / hate as a producer and detective, but they grow on you. And Toby Wing is a sexy stupid tease like Nancy who tries to say something to Oakie, but gets a "Not Now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen, I was not surprised at the revelation of who did it. And get a strain on how naked the women here are (of course, their breasts are covered, either by their hands or a little tip top). This was very clear pre-code. Worth watching movies that are interested in this kind of thing. P. S. As a long-lived Louisiana resident, I like to note when someone was born here as Carlisle was a New Orleans native.
