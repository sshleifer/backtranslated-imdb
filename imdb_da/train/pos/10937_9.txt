For all the hoopla, respect and recognition that this movie comes from Kung Fu historians, it still lacks sharp focus on a few critical areas: action and battle scenes. But I have to say that the plot is probably the best and most original I have ever seen in a martial arts movie. Five deadly venom no doubt is a must, not just a movie you can see over and over again; But I must also say that after seeing it, you feel it could have been even better. It leaves you somehow something you want more. Producer Chang Cheh puts the story beautifully for a potential masterpiece, but does not continue to give us more of the action we want. The fighting styles in the movie really take the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad) and they are shown, but the battles are noticeably short. The Toad and Snake styles are especially exciting and should have been featured a lot, much more, in fact, Toad is killed by the middle of the movie. Interestingly enough, with this movie, the absence of constant action or struggle for the development of a great plot is one of the few kung fu movies where you are truly interested in the story and interested in the result. This movie has a dark and evil tone to it and you are drawn into the mood. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the film and add to the film's feelings. To start the movie and introduce the poison chamber producer, Chang Cheh takes us to a nasty dungeon. Final battle scenes are certainly good, but seem subdued and somehow you expected more. Still, this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is totally entertaining. My overall impression of the movie would conclude this: The styles used by the fighters are only shown to us and not shown in detail. Sad thing is, the director had something extraordinary at his fingertips and did not expand. I wonder what could have been with this movie, still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
