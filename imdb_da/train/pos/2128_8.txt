I just watched this at Turner Classic Movies last night, for the first time ever to see it, and I loved it. I like many of the older films, especially because of the lack of all the dirty language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think they were done much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine. I just thought this movie was very fun to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you feel the same way about the older movies, I don't think you can go wrong with this. I think "You've got mail" is a remake (though slightly different and also a very enjoyable movie.) Of this movie. For a relaxing night out with a movie, you don't have to be ashamed of whether your kids or anyone goes into your viewing, get it or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
