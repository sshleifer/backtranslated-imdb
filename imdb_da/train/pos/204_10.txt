First, I don't like almost any Neil Simon movie. But there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and I would say that it is among the most entertaining comedies I've seen. The second time I saw it, the connection was ready. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Oh, afraid they might sue so he changed them to men. And how boring it would be if they were only wives, some biz stars are more fun. Now it's a personal review and my still living grandmother aged 97 (she even survived Walter Matthau's magnificent imitation of her!) Would deny it - but some of you will find resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have a little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he got into one of the finest entertainment results I can remember (and my old grandmother enjoyed it himself even though they did not recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the movie character). <br /> Very ethnic in taste, and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn it off. For me, the pleasure is lingers.
