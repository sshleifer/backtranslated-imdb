This is the best mob file ever made. It deserved more than what the Oscar did. Nominated for things like his score, art direction, supportive role (Newman), this movie could easily be nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks gives one of his best performances and the child who played Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised I can't see him in more movies today. Critics themselves did not give this movie enough credit. But besides the incredible performances, another real star of this movie is the incredible music. This was by far the best score of the year. It was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. My Grade A +
