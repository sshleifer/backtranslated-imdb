This show was amazing and I always look forward to seeing it. All the characters were fun and amazing in their own way, each episode gave unobstructed laughter, and it was totally entertaining and different than many other shows. Everyone was just crazy and breathtakingly fun that you couldn't help loving this show. There were some dead weight episodes, but that '70s show was always able to create a kind of sympathetic atmosphere to where it just worked It's one of the best shows ever to be broadcast, and I want to see this show anytime I can, for it never gets old, never gets unfunny and never becomes uninteresting.
