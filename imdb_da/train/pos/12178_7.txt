I think this movie got a low rating because it was judged by the worst moments. There is a diarrhea ghost and an embarrassing nut scratching scene, but apart from that, there are actually a few moments that made me laugh aloud. Jason Lee performs some wonderfully subtle comedies in this movie, and Julia Stiles manages to be quite astonishing fun herself. Apart from the fact that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after approx. 40 minutes into it, you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick ... Cheers
