Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty movie. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really beautiful cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk dress is also great. She looks good; Boyer looks young and trim out. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman seeking meaning and a priest seeking life seems quite obsolete, but against such unreal sets and skies it is somehow works, given the two stars, great score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting cast. The movie runs like 76 minutes and seems poorly edited and some characters appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is fun as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old pastor, Lucile Watson, the mother's superior Tilly Losch dancer John Carradine divine and Basil Rathbone plays .... Now I'm not sure . He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was turned to the star by Dietrich. I can't help but believe he would have been wonderful. The world-renowned Boris role would have looked after the great Gilbert quite well. And after Queen Christina's success (with Garbo), his career has come back on track. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any other 30s movie Dietrich had in color. She looks good and wears some great clothes. My favorite is Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears at the pool. It is definitely worth a visit for the lush sets and colors and the two great stars.
