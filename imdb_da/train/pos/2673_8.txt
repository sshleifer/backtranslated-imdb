Journey of Hope (1990) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor Turks do so they could live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as Westerners that they will give up their lives and live in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are swollen with greedy villains who are living on charging huge fees for desperate people who are in no wind. A family discourages the cold, the treacherous mountain range and predator criminals to discover that there is not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists worldwide, not just in America. Some people tend to forget about it. A heartbreak of a movie that leaves you wondering why at the end. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
