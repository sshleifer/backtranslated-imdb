This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The football is extraordinary, fascinating at times. It also received an Oscar for best photography, and earned it. I have many films in my movie collection and several more I have seen beyond them, and not many of them are more beautiful or just as beautifully shot as this one. <br /> <br /> It's unique and a great movie. Cast is great and does a good job of portraying their characters. We follow their destiny with devotion and become very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I like much of this movie for what it represents and how it presents it. I highly recommend it
