This movie was a rather entertaining comedy about Murphy's housing and housing law. If a movie like this was made today, the family would no doubt be dysfunctional. When it was put in "simpler" eighties, we get what was supposed to be a typical family in the era. Grant of course fits perfectly with the comic and dramatic elements, and he works with a more than competent support cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans provide a solid ninety minute entertainment, 7/10.
