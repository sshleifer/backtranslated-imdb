If there's a genre I've never been a fan of, it's biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes and trickery around, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often make a great disservice to the people they are trying to catch on the screen. Skeptiscism is the place for hype with most biopics that make their way to the big screen and the infamous Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and filmmakers protested against Gretchen Mol, who gave the role of Bettie Page, and said she was no longer a celebrity and did not have the chops for that matter. I never doubted that Mol could handle that part since, but I never expected to be blown away by her performance when I was just watching the movie hours ago. Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin-up girl, who, after an early abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few board members would likely do) accidentally becomes one of the most talked about all the time. The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90-minute maturity, but despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that maybe a small part of the story is missing. Director / co-author Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's amazing script is only horrified by one too abrupt and not as clear as it should end. Nevertheless, credit must be given to the two ladies to create an almost flawless biopic that manages to celebrate both its subject and the decade it emulates eminently. Come Oscar's time, Mol, Turner and Harron were to receive nominations. Doubt it will happen even though there are certainly no three women more deserving of them. 9.10
