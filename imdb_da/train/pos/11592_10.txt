My son was 7 years old when he watched this movie, he is now on a Russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and who has long been in his mind all these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and Eagle. He asked if it was possible for me to get it to him. I am sure many things go through his head as he only has 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood, he links this movie. On January 27, he will be 47 years old and I want to be able to get this movie to him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years, and as we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
