One of several musicals about sailors in leave, it is the usual sailor who meets girl, complications arise, exclaims happy kind of plot. It goes along smoothly enough, but it also draws in places. The dialogue is not as zippy as "Top Hat", for example, and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. It has some of Irving Berlin's best songs, including 'Let yourself go', 'I put all my eggs in a basket' and 'Let's see music and dance'. It has Fred and Ginger, who when they dance, take films to heavenly heights, and they do not disappoint here. They make a talked taped dance, a knockabout comic dance and a whirling graceful dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> It also has Harriet Hilliard, who is quite good at her role. She had a varied career and became the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she touches without being sentimental. Here two songs are delivered easily and efficiently. She makes a good contrast to Ginger, but you may think they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More tightening has made the movie even better. Well good though.
