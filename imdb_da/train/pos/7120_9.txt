Most war movies made in the United States during World War II were very fun to watch, but suffered from serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for propaganda value to raise spirits at home than anything else. I'm not beating these movies, as many of them are still very attentive. But because they often lack realism, they are prevented from being really good movies. A perfect example was the John Garfield movie Air Force - where a B-17 almost unilaterally takes out half of the Japanese air force! Pride of The Marines, however, is a successful departure - where high scores are set to portray a true story in a fairly accurate manner. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not a true story, as it seemed too unlikely to be true. But after investigating further, I found out that it was actually quite true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to serve the honorary medal. This is a case where reality seemed too incredible to be true!
