This movie has a special place in my heart, which when I first caught it, I learned adult skills. It rang very well to me and even an excellent student I had at that time. There are scenes that make you shiver with sudden emotions and those who even put a smile on your face through pure identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, placed with their best work, a great tour of a young Martha Plimpton, an inspirational storyline, and a thrilling musical score provide a most fun and rewarding experience .
