I will start by saying that this undeserved has been panned by almost everyone! The fact is, it wasn't what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was the cockney geezers and the good one liners "do you like that day?" etc., but this is much more mature than his previous works. I agree that it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to watch them and listen harder, this movie requires all your attention! Look past the cool and dazzling look of the movie, try listening to the dialogue rather than admiring the performances, and I think we all get a more thorough understanding of the whole movie. Yes it has its influence from modern classics (fighting club, pulp fiction, etc.), but it is in the whole original in both directions and pacing with a music score second to none. I feel that if everyone watched this movie over and over again, they would understand it much more and perhaps appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema as it is, and I also hope that Ritchie continues in this in vain, then I prefer this for his mockney "masterpieces".
