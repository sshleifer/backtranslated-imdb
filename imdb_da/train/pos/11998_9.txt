This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable images, good acting and touching subject. It would be very easy to write it out as being too sentimental, but it is the emotions this type of movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the history and presentation of history. There were some cheesy shots, but one can expect this in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can say is that there was not much detail. However, this film was not created to explain any element of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumphs, controversy, errors, etc. It was designed for a quick glimpse of a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all the time.
