this movie was pretty horrible Vipul Shah's last movie was good, one was just bad, although it's a good story and handled in a good way. Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this movie from another gujarati game "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to see there are many flaws in this movie, but still an entertainer songs are pretty bleak and does not work well, but they are still good in general not a movie you would enthusiastically see it is still a story to take into account, and it is good if you are the type of relationship, quite good movie with lots of errors and humor, There really is no need even a bit
