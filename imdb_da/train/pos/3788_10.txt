This movie is beautiful. It is genuine and down in the heart, but at the same time totally wild. The characters are easy to fall in love with because they have so many different minds, but we all could refer to at least. In Canada, we do not have many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few I have seen, Loners is one of the best. It is very fun and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, see Loners.
