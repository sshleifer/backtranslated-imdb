This series is "something different". Sometimes European series are less accurate than the US, but this time, authors have hit the right goal, creating a blend that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, it has everything: fantastic plot, smart, witty, always well-delivered lines, a fantastic theatrical timing showed off all the stars and beautiful shots in Berlin, one of the world's most interesting cities. It is entertaining to see how things work in the field of justice in countries other than the United States and to once "feel" the old Europe's way of dealing with life. Kudos to all the casting and crew for a well done comedy that will be a must see in the coming years. Watching the series in German is super.
