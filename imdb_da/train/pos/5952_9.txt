This movie is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history teaching, so I just accept it as it is. Bing performs in his usual infinite style quite well as the blacksmith Hank Martin, who is accidentally transported back to another age, King Arthur's time. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande or Sandy, who is the subject of Hank's feelings, though engaged to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I just love the episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in tattered clothes and head to the highway with their backpacks to experience the kingdom first. King Arthur's comment, "I say we are not alone" while his scruffy clothes are a good step is one of the hilarious moments in the movie. William Bendix's portrayal is extremely ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at quaint "you Olde English." <br /> <br /> The story is not deep but it is well done in my opinion and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It is also a good family entertainment. <br /> <br />
