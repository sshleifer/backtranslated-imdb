I've seen it plenty of times and I'm planning to buy the full feature. I love all of Jason Steele's comedies. It is very different and unique and is very comfortable. I love indie movies and this one is just amazing. The reason is strange but very fun. This short film is about a talking spatula named Edward. The order of the events is a little jumbled, making this movie very interesting to see. At first you see Edward fighting for spoons, but then the focus shifts to earlier in his life. This is a stupid movie, but of course it's still amazing. I strongly recommend that you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It is very fun. The mood can't match everyone's taste, but look anyway. It only takes 16 minutes of your time and it is free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
