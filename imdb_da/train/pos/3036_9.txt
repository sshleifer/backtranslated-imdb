The name just says it all. I watched this movie with my dad when it came out and had served in Korea, he had great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this movie is that it only concentrates on a short period of human life - interestingly, man's whole life had made such an epic bio image that it is dizzying to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters avoid the poor man's cheap shots. The theme of the movie "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just words that are blathered from the lips of a high-pitched officer - this is the deep statement of a man's total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck is the liberal that he gained a better understanding of the man. He does a good job showing the fearless general ravaged by the human side of the man.
