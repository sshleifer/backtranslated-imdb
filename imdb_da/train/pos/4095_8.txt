Now my friends, films like "La BÃªte" (aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done on the old continent :) in this movie we all see: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac black off gorilla, non emotional dialogues etc ... etc .. In serious terms now, it is an allegory that men can sometimes be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's an amazing movie experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this, I recommend "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
