This is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie movies will really appreciate. It has good plays, lots of gore and a decent plot. You will be reminded of films like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not so big, but the film really is the atmosphere and solid performances of the actors, which seem to be lacking in many of today's great budget special effects-filled films. The movie really moves together and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the movie is a little short. In addition, it seems that the end leaves an opening for a successor, which would also be very interesting. So take some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy it here.
