Being a person who normally does not enjoy boxing movies, feels that they only focus on boxing and not the characters themselves, this movie really moved me. I loved being able to see the protagonist Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) going through so many things in such a short time that it was great for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a wonderful job of playing Diana, especially as this was her first acting experience, she showed true emotions and portrayed Diana wonderfully. All actors had chemistry on the screen and made this movie even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie even to those who normally don't see boxing movies. 10.10
