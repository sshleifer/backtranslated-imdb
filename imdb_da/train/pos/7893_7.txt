I think I'm part of the silent minority who's had this movie. Is it one of the best in the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential. As parts 4 and 5 kind of hit the series, I felt this so-called last installment ("New Nightmare" is the right final) brought the series out of its decline. There are some good nightmarish sequences, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a stoner that is rubbing, falling asleep and stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is both a very original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of dreamscape, jumping around like Super Mario. And Freddy belts the fun one-liner, "Great graphics." And since the film was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy began to control the game with Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> Casting is fantastic. Lisa Zane is perfectly thrown in the lead. I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man" and I think I saw last time that the movie was about 5 years ago. He is another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a strong screen presence. And who can forget about cameos? The best is Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") who plays an anti-drug advertising spokesman. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is truly amazing! So for those looking to check out this movie - please rent or buy it on DVD! Hopefully all editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video release has removed the 3D item. <br /> <br /> I personally didn't see many things wrong with the movie. It even further elaborated on Freddy's backgrounds. The film is a good mix of humor and scare, and the burnout effect is great. Could this have given the franchise better justice? It could of course have. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And finally, I loved the mounting above the opening point. Fans of the series will be happy and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
