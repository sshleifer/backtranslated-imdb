The film begins with Vincent Price starting his performance as a magician. But in between the very successful show comes the police and shuts him down. It seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks that the Prize had created - even those he did at his own time at home. As a result, Price rightly kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Price was killed and probably thought it was a good thing, because the price was a bit sour, he just couldn't stop by one (like eating Lay's Potato Chips). <br /> <br /> The film was filled with very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a large circular saw and a crematorium on the performances), great plot twists and thrilling action. One thing you can't say about this movie is that it is boring. Although it is also far from subtle, it is fun throughout, although it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Having never seen Vincent Price's version of the HOUSE OF WAX, I would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN much more and scored it an 8 or 9. That's because while MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie, reminds it most about the movie that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The reason is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula resumed in the follow-up movie. Both were made in 3-D, both have a plot where Price has every reason to kill, but he can't stop when he's committed the first, and both are very fun to see. The biggest differences and few are that the HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror movie, and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie AND THE HOUSE OF WAX (price edition only). They are both amazing 1950s horror movies.
