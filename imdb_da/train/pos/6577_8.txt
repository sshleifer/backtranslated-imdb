With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's games have almost disappeared from the theater these days. To bow, talky also seems to be the general judgment. This BBC version of one of Shaw's funniest plays does not reflect this judgment. It's certainly bow and talky, but it's also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British theater, it's completely cast with actors who - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us have probably never heard of. Carter is beautiful as the Bulgarian girl who puts the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One can contravene the particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry who brought the accusation into the lines of the enemy and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. But the role invitingly overpowering and Ryecart was obviously told to over-act. The other players are letter perfect. Carter as the self-dramatic Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as the Swiss soldier-of-fortune are of course at the doctor's center, and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" comes across as a filmed game. But you are unlikely to ever see a Shaw movie that does not betray its origin. The grounds are generally wise. But Shaw is about the dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are immaterial. Enjoy this for what it is.
