This little movie had long been on my "keeper" list. Do people realize how stressed, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as the mentally retarded) were truly treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century ?? !! All the pious, agitated Christian attitudes of that time were mortal to explore TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone examine what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized women as emotions and emotional responses as big as a man? Think about it! This film's sensitivity still gets me, and I give credit to the director to capture this through his eyes.
