The best way for me to describe Europe, which is high on the list of my favorite films, is the exclamation that came from a companion after the movie ended: "I didn't know that movies could be made that way". Completely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It's so far away from the ship's master and cover that one can get; perfect integration of many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice over, performance, editing, lighting etc .. all equal, none predominantly. Despite Hollywood's "dialog" nearsightedness, cinema is not about dialogue, nor is it about beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the presentation of these elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will convey the idea. Reduce or eliminate contributions from an item and the movie has no meaning. "Europe" is what the cinema must strive to be.
