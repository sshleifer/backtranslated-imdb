Sandwich between San Francisco and Captains Brave two of Spencer Trace's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects on some people. They gave him a gun star Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. Tracy and Tone are a couple of world wars I draftees, Tone is a weak character who almost crosses the hill in boot camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy still plays the beloved blowhard, younger Wallace Beery type, which MGM imagined for him when they signed him away from Fox. <br /> <br /> On the front, Tone gets a chance and takes it when, during a fight, he manages to get to a church tower looking down on a German machine gun nest. He has learned to shoot now and he does a sergeant York. But Alvin C. York was never changed by the war that Tone has. <br /> <br /> The wound in the fight Tone is confronted in a hospital with Gladys George looking out for him. Tracy himself goes to visit his friend and he and George get something started. Later when Tracy is reported missing in action, Tone and George were married. Tracy is crushed when he comes back and learns about marriage, but takes his step. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about Tone using the war skills he has learned at gangsterism. He's a hitman now, and George doesn't really know what he's doing to live. I think you can figure out the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that gave me some trouble is that I can't believe Gladys George couldn't figure it out. She is a street smart girl, her part is much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Talking about The Roaring Twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character development similar to Tones, though he was not the film's central character. In fact, there are elements of you giving him a gun found in taxi driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The fighting sequences of World War I are very well-placed by Director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin puts this movie, I think it's much better than he gave it credit.
