A strange, witty and wonderful depiction of family life! Author Andrew Marshall has written something that is fun, vain and occasionally scary! Yes, don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful melody and bubbly characters; The show has a dark side, and sometimes it can be quite chilling. And that's what is so good about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom, where each character is a 2D comic unit (the case with My family). Instead, the characters are completely rounded people showing the full slide of human emotions. The occasionally dark moments that Bill is apparently haunted by a curse, and Ben wakes up in a bizarre village, are two examples of the show taking a surreal, dark ride that helps add a little depth. Of course, the show is also incredibly fun, and it is guaranteed that you smile. It's a shame Eureka Video has stopped releasing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope of getting episodes that are not available in stores.
