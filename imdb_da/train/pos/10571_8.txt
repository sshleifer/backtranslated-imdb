James Cagney is best known for his hard character and gangster roles, but he has also played many "soft" characters in his career. This musical is one of them, and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney wanted to star in. Cagney even does a little song in this and also some dance. And it must be said that he was not bad at it. He plays the role with great confidence. He apparently had some dance jobs in his early life before his acting career began to take time out, so it's actually no wonder he also took some musical plays in his career. Of course, he also feels comfortable in this completely different genre than most people are used to seeing him in. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who may be among the best and most successful instructors in the world. genre. His earliest '30s musicals largely defined the musical genre, and he was also responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street". His musicals were always easy and fun to see and more comedy than anything else really. The '30 musicians never acted on their song, it was something that more emphasized in the 40s and later made musicals, mostly from MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, it has a light and simple story set in the musical world, of course it is predictable and evolves in a formal way. It is nevertheless a fun and simple story that also makes it an entertaining movie to watch. Then do the characters and actors depicting them. Kind of strange, but the overall plot line in the movie is kind of left to the end of the movie when the movie only begins to consist of musical numbering. <br /> <br /> The musical moments towards the end of the movie are also entertaining and well done, though I'm not too big a fan of the genre itself. Once again, the musical tracks also feature a young Billy Barty. he often played little boys / babies / mice and anything more early in his career, including the movie musicians "Gold Diggers of 1933", a year earlier. <br /> <br /> A recommended early genre film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
