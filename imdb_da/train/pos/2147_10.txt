I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train commutes, bike rides from the train station, soup stands and other typical scenes depicted as well, certainly added to my own appreciation for this movie that I really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this movie painted with vibrant colors, but you don't have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Director Suo's tricks were subtle for the most part; I found his highlight character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter that makes her sublime a little bit constructed, but most of the director's tricks were so gentle that I was fully drawn in and just danced with his characters. Or cry. Or laugh out loud. Wonderful. A +.
