I just can't believe some of the comments on this show! The show is just genius! Sure it doesn't follow the tried and true, but we as consumers always want the same things that push us over and over again. Should we not have the opportunity to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while. The style is not as realistic as previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it shouldn't be. The show titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Slight" What part of the title states that the entire beloved cast of other releases would always be involved in the action. And nowhere does it say they would solve mysteries, and they can't even stand monsters, so why would they? I'm actually glad they put some long standing plot points working in a Scooby-Doo show. They still have ongoing jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, quick-change outfits in hunting scenes, standard hallway gag and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad this show is out there because I just love it. I myself am glad that they were driven by the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on only two main characters and one villain. It's probably ridiculous, it must be! Sure it's different, it must be. It would make you laugh at the villain and cheer for the idiotic robot shop to defeat all invading pests, regardless of size. You must get the running "Roobi-Roo" joke. The whole thing is just put together so well, there is not one thing I can believe it is wrong with it. The script, the play, the animation, all in the top. The title music is amazing (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it starts up) and the background music is just gripping.
