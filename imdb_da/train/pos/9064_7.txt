I sat with my kids when we saw this movie. We all found that it was a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth grade starts bullying things with him and that's what leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy only has so much time to eat 10 worms or other. From this point, the bull and his friends are trying to make unpleasant ways to cook, roast or bake the worms to try and get Billy sick so he will lose the game. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming more and more like everyone, even the bullying friends. <br /> <br /> I don't want to tell you if he wins or not ... just watch it to find out, but I think if you like good family movies, you will like this. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all daughters, and they liked it a lot.
