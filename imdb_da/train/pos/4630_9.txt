This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. The amazing actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, also has a minor role in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis living together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who connects them to and from - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There are some kind of friends / sex in the city going on (mostly homosexual), and they all just want the war to end so they can continue their lives in peace. But it's rubbing. No matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have, the war will not end. Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it in some way. There are many on Israeli side, both there and here in the United States, who just want it all and will not consider peace. There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job whose peace would ever come. It is in no interest to end this war and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always your heart when you see this fun and engaging movie. It won't go away. You know something that is tragic that will happen, and of course it does. With the emotions on both sides running strong and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens and that is what makes this an adult version of friends / sex in the city. There is no superficiality. It is real life and it was a beautiful thing to see.
