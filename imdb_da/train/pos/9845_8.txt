I'm not going to lie, this is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago at my local theater. I saw it another time, and I was a little sorry for the slow scenes. Sid (the sloth) is not so flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is excellent and the story has a touching end. It is worth taking children 10 and under, but teenagers would probably find it a little boring. Also the uniqueness of the characters is so interesting. As I said, this is a pretty good movie, but I would rate "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8.10
