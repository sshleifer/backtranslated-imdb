I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never stops. The whole movie was done very well. The finish is really good. Ontop that it is action packed, they even have a surprised effort there for you. When I saw what the movie was about on the Internet, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but I sense that such a big Luke perry fan, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I gave it a try because it was a very good but out-of-the-box movie. It was very original. Anyone who believed in this movie gets a standing ovation from me. The action was great. Luke Perry again did an excellent job. I give this movie the highest rating.
