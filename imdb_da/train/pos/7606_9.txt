The first series of Lost kicked off with a bang ... literally and slowly declined. This may have put some viewers off, and people who began to look halfway through would either be bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I want to advise people who are new to the world of Lost to simply look from the beginning and not get away from the slower episodes. The action throughout is excellent, but why have 5 series planned ... why? All this means that there will be no answer for at least 4 years, okay, I will keep an eye on whether it keeps the tension up and the dialogue flowing.
