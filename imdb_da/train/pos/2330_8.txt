This show is good. I like the plays, the fun pieces and the beauty of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc. They did everything well in the show. The show started off well with its fun, illogical basic idea of ​​bringing the dead people back into the first series and, frankly, as they said, the first episodes in the second series were a bit of a disappointment, but it later came back well anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it's being canceled. Why does ABC not just end the whole end when all episodes are already finished ?? I really want to know how the story should be. I think it should be given a chance as there are still so many viewers who love it.
