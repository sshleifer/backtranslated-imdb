Orson Welles' "The Lady From Shanghai" doesn't have the amazing play of "Citizen Kane", but Charles Lawton, Jr.'s movie, the unforgettable set pieces (like the picture in the aquarium, the sailing scene with an amazing, blonde Rita Hayworth song " Please Do not Love Me "and the truly amazing Hall of Mirrors climax) and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in his greatest performance, Welles in a beautifully understated role, the aforementioned Miss Hayworth - Welles' wife at that time - at her most beautiful) makes for a very memorable movie experience. The bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling, not at all impenetrable. The viewer is amazed by the twists, and Welles' closing line is an unruly classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial arbiter.
