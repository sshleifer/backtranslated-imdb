I had seen several days of filming this movie that summer, the end result was only two scenes in the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Take the cart, stop the cart, etc. Look at this Dakota youth looking forward to watching the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo crew was knocked down, so the shooting scenes were too real. (yes Doris, animals were injured during admission) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great Western / social commentary from the 50s. This should be in the same class as High Noon for true Western drama or used as a social statement such as the Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for the 50's youth.
