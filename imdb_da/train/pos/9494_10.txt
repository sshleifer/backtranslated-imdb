WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claimed that it is one of the funniest and coolest low budget actions ever made. I don't generally see movies knowing they are getting bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was very glad I did. <br /> <br /> It's filled with the brim of action (much of the surprising graphic gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but so much of it in a scene that it becomes fun) and outrageously unpleasant dialogue, all adding to the laughter-inducing tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ginty, the exceptional-looking star of the EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget active turds), is entertaining at the forefront of the best performance he could muster. Williamson is better than usual, obviously hamming it up with unparalleled joy (and he doesn't come in midway through). The rest of the throw is also fun to watch, especially the bad guys, one of whom is a sadistic sex pot that speaks with an accent that seems to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. She is invaluable. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how much it was. It is not so bloody that it is nauseating, but it is rarely violent in parts with some fleshy squibs going out in the shootouts, and it has a cruel torture sequence that nobody will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is swirled by a lot of bad guys, he conveniently gets hold of a chainsaw, and the splattering moments that follow will have all the action fans cheering and wasting their beers. <br /> <br /> Don't miss WHITE FIRE. It's a tasty - if persistently stupid - action classic.
