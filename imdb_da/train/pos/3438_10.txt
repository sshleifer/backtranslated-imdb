The movie was very excellent despite the NC-17 rating and disruptive scenes. In fact, such things happen as such, and so this film shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in outstanding performances), if she recently attended college has all the good for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a fantastic performance) at a frat party that turns out to be a true gentleman and sweet. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they stop going to their apartment. They talk and take her to the basement where they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. This incident is her. She goes to a club that meets a bartender / DJ Adrian (wonderfully played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting drunk and helping before she goes a long way. They make a friendship. He also does drugs, and Maya also begins to use. In other words, introduces her to another world. She starts going back to school and works as TA (Teaching Assistant) and stains Jared as one of the students. While students take a midway, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand deciding to invite him to her place. Will the story repeat itself? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You see the movie. Outstanding A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role of focus and endurance. Chad Faust doesn't like that he can be a rape, but he does a great job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very brilliant man who saves Maya and trains her into a new world. This movie deserves a prize.
