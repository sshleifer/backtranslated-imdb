I rented this a few years ago, the video store only had VHS at that time. Right to video was to hit it's steps (you know where the box covers using the same font and color schemes of successful movies). I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was "what the hell's wrong with the sound?" - There was obviously no dialogue copying. Words echo so I stopped mumbling what I needed to be aware of - remember, there is no Shakespeare here! Just simple speech. The story is simple enough, the boy meets girl etc. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt, the people in the film did not seem like caricatures written into history, but non-actors temporarily picked from their real job (uniforms included). Nevertheless, you begin to notice what the filmmaker is after, so see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people are hurting their individuals through vulgarities, it could not have hurt the marketing. There was something honest about it. They wanted a bigger budget, it would have been better, which I am sure they considered daily, but they went ahead and made it, I felt what independent filmmaking is about. The word "Indy" is thrown around as if it's a genre .. Hi! .. it's fun!
