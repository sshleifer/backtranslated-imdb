I have to say when "Pushing Daisies" came out, I was immediately won out of the adventure as putting such grimness. The narrator made a cake out of the whole trial by making death seem as routine as good, Ned (Lee Pace) baking pies. And bringing them back to life was just as routine. <br /> <br /> The trio of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), and sometimes sidekick Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked such a joy) created for a fantastic dialogue and sadness. It certainly deserves the title of a (romantic) comedy / drama. <br /> <br /> Down and Chuck made a shy and not-quite-ready love couple who are still exploring their feelings, even though they can't touch - an obstacle that seems to be really no obstacle with aids like gloves. cellophane and quirky schedules around the apartment. But despite the unpleasantness presented when working their feelings about a strange secret that few people know, they still manage to show their on-screen chemistry by touching scenes that when Ned gives Chuck the beekeepers. However, the presence of Olive provides some outbreak meetings in the cake shop and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply and put a damper on a show that had real potential. On some of the episodes, the plot line was hasty and awkward, which made you ask "what just happened?" in both the overall dead-person-of-week plot and in the overall plot line. The addition of Chuck's father plus two half-brothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled (not the episode "Comfort Food" feels like the episode "Bitter Sweets" in the fact that it died-off -You died in food?). A few touching moments (the beekeepers) happened to help promote the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they became close, the authors decided to throw another ape-key rather than let the relationship evolve. (Oliver comes back from the monastery Chuck's dead father comes back to life and does not go back, you get the picture). Shame it didn't work but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy-smiley going on and incredible scenarios to remind that it's not "Dead Like Me." Then again, it is in "Pushing Daisies time," according to Creator Bryan Fuller, so it makes it plausible again. <br /> <br /> It should have lasted longer, but it's just wild thinking at this time. Kudos for what new show is trying to replace this short-lived gem.
