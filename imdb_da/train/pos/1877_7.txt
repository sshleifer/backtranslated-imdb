Arthur Bach is certainly unhappy in his life as a millionaire and attracted to people under him in a social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scene and is so much attracted to a shoplifter. <br /> <br /> He also drinks quite a bit, and sometimes he runs while drinking, which of course is not fun ever. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing, but behind the comedy there are also some realities. John Gielgud dries the floor with everyone else on the screen and created a sign for ages. Talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but Gielgud like "Hobson" will remember you most.
