Steve Carell has made a career of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'The Daily Show' and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a wise and fun script that perfectly utilizes his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little weird, but in an unfortunate good guy kind of way. One night, while socializing with his colleagues for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His colleagues, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially drunk Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent person Andy is and they resolve to help him out by helping him finish his virginity. And then Andy's beginnings in adulthood. Andy is the extraordinary innocent, and the bulk of humor stems from his naivety to the situations he finds throughout the film. Some of the humor is raw rough stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually touching, as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or drama; It rolls into your seats comedy. Still, all the good comedies I've ever seen have enough heart to worry about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a little more vulgar in some of her jokes. I especially loved the end of the movie, which I thought was a perfect way to end the girl. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of "Something about Mary". Very light and fun; It leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you're done with a comedy. I would highly recommend.
