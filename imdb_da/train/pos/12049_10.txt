I gave this movie a 10/10 with some reluctance as it is hard to praise something that looked haunted and scared me for years. The pure threat to the woman in the face of the variety is just plain scare, and the accompanying music only exacerbates the fear. <br /> <br /> I saw this as it was the first time on television when I was 10, and it really disturbed me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. So many movie reviews continue with how disruptive or scary movies can be, but you can believe in all those who posted on this board. These are really incredibly powerful things. I think I really like horror movies and generally find them quite fun more often than not, but it's really threatening and will probably disturb most people. I haven't seen it since I was 10, and I'm tempted to see it again, but fear I might have some sleepless nights. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly it is, but I think it's something to do with fear being the woman's greatest weapon, and that we as viewers are as receptive as we feel the fear so intense. It is noteworthy that other viewers feelings are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I've also seen the stage play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing compares to this.
