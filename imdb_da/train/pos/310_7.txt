Dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary to tell any life story. In the case of "Lucy", the key points of Lucille Balls are teens, early careers and 20 years of marriage to Desi Arnaz all included, albeit in a shortened and reworked manner. <br /> <br /> The main emotional points of Lucy's life are clear: Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress, and finally flourishing into the brilliant comedienne who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage with Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi creates the first television empire and forever ensures their place in history as the TV's most memorable sitcom couple. Like Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Don't expect to see the very same miraculous transformation that one Judy Davis made while playing Judy Garland, but York makes Ball strong, yet sympathetic, and is a lot of fun in itself. Although her comedy timing is different to Lucy, she is still credible. The film never goes much into her perfectionist behavior on the set, and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance in the early "I Love Lucy" years, but observing York portrays the Lucy exercise privately, is a good inclusion. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and makes the most decent job with Desi's accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not too memorable, as teenager Lucy. <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not presented much, fortunately, when Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they are not good actors in their own right, they were just not all that fit the people they played. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland, and the suppressed accents can sometimes occur. <br /> <br /> Although the film's main structure sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some of which seem to be unexplained. Jess Oppenheimer, lead author of Lucy's radio program "My Favorite Husband", which started in 1948, is depicted in this film arriving on stage to help "I Love Lucy" in 1951, completely away from the fact that he was the most important creator! This film also depicts Marc Daniels as the greatest "I love Lucy" director for his entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Also, although I expect this was due to budgetary constraints, Ricardo's has been living in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York, when they actually changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen is slightly larger and out of scale from the original as well. Connecticut's home looks pretty close to the original unless the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. <br /> <br /> Desi also talks about buying RKO in 1953, under Lucy's red scare event, although RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes may well have been too dramatic a license and the film does work to convey the most important facts, but would it have caused them to show a little more respect for Oppenheimer and Asher, two important characters in "I Love Lucy" history? The biggest gaff comes in "I Love Lucy" recreational scenes, at least a few of them. It is always risky to recreate something caught on film and it has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene of the huge bread loaf was shortened, and anyone familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences immediately! "We have a child" number was also shortened, but apart from that, it was almost dead. By far the best was the "grape-stomping" scene, with Rachel York really nailing Lucy's way. The producers made the wise decision not to try to restore "Vitametavegamin" and the candy factory bit, instead of showing the actors to exercise them. These scenes proved to be effective because of that approach. <br /> <br /> The main mistake of the movie is that it assumes that viewers already know a lot about Lucy's life, since much is skimmed or omitted at all. Overall, it gives a decent portrait of Lucy & Desi's marriage, and the actual errors can be overlooked when character development works effectively.
