Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) comes out of the reform school and goes back to the slum. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does his best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. Apart from his associations with the Termite band, Gabe is followed by real gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and Gabe is. It is up to the Termites to work the law to their advantage and give their gangsters just desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that introduces Dead End Kids is really pretty good. The boys walk over to the new residents' furniture on the street and continue to make it their own. They talk to each other in fake posh accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then continue to start a fight with the new boy, but after he has proved to be a good fighter, they ask him to join the club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is also good, filled with evil, seemingly dangerous, but is really pretty smart and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop is studying to become the boy's mayor, he has a dream of schoolwork. This is wonderfully staged, with small holograms of the children walking on his face and shooting questions on him. Angels Wash Their Faces is a great title because it plays out the success of angels with dirty faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. Notoriously bad behavior on and off the set makes these boys enjoyable in this movie. But instead of seemingly disingenuous, it gives some good laughs. This is an example of what many of the boys would be in The Bowery Boys series. We even get a few disturbed words from Leo Gorcey.
