Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as a title character in this funny little Gothic nail bits. She accepts a position as secretary to a London community dowager (played tremendously by Dame May Witty) and her scary son (the effete and annoying George Macready). Before she knows it, she awakens to find herself in a seaside resort, she's never seen before, where Vigig and Macready call Marian and try to convince the servants and nearby townspeople that she is Maced's fearful wife. Of course, this couple can only plan killed acts, and even though we know that Julia should eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis is building genuine excitement by answering the question of how she can handle it. <br /> <br /> "My Name Is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to set it apart from any number of movies that came out in the same time period, but I was surprised at how well it coincided despite its shoes - string budget and B-movie pedigree. There are a few moments that just got you on the edge of your seat, and I found myself really rooting for Julia when she caught on the system under her feet and started throwing her captives. In any other gothic thriller, the hero would have swung, screamed and dithered and waited for her hero to come and rescue her. So I can't tell you how refreshing it was to get the heroine of this movie to use his brain and find out how to save himself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
