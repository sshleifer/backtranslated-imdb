I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a child and was happy to see that a movie was made about the book. <br /> <br /> I was kid-seated for a boy and a girl aged 11 and 8 and had to talk to the girl to watch the movie. But fortunately at the end she was glad she saw it and even said she would buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. There were some great laughing moments and the movie wasn't as "gross" as I expected it would be ... tho it was quite high up there on the gross meter ... the only thing I can't figure out is why they had to having the "dilly" line in there that Woody had made with reference to his private part ... it was for me the only choke moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasping at that moment in the movie) .. I have no idea why it was filmed in the movie; It added nothing to the actual movie except for the shock / gasp factor ... except for that, a pretty good movie. Nice to see the "Pepsi" girl, all adults.
