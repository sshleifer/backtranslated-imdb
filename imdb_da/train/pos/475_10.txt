John Turturro once again demonstrates his intuitive Russian chess genius, preparing for a comeback tournament and creating an unlikely relationship with a resident at home at Emily Watson at a 1920's Italian hotel. They fall in love with the horror of her social mountaineering mother (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story whose shadow gloss can make it appear cerebral. But despite its origins in a Nabakov story, it certainly is not. The romantic elements and the feeling of time and place struck down the psychological analysis of the hands. John Turturro, who appeared in "Barton Fink", "O Brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he does not rely on the Coen Bros movie to claim his stature.
