The 700 Club offers a good perspective on world events. Some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy. I find the program to be informative and inspiring. It is only natural for many to throw at a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few shows that can point to a 40-year track record of success in the television media, and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be murdered, I find it curious that so many people will literally travel over themselves to jump on the car. I have certainly said some foolish things in my life. I would definitely be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson, when he puts on a great show.
