Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the crackle script. There are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famous reunification scene could have been much obscured by the minority actors involved. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course Oscar moreso in the Odd Par), and with all the little idiosyncracies and ways Matthau jumps into the character (the line where he claims he is with that side he lives in the city while Lewis lives in the country Lewis is "out of touch" is the hallmark of this) making this one of the best ideas I have ever seen in any actor in any role it be either comedian or drama or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work excellently together; The contrast they portray highlights Simon's amazing ability to create comic conflict. This movie is simply one of the ultimate "must-see" and requires a legitimate prestigious place in the history of film history.
