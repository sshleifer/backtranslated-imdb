The Japanese "Run Lola Run", his is an offbeat movie that will put a smile on almost everyone's face. Fans of Run Lola Run, Tampopo, Go !, and Slacker will probably like this. It tends to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days with separate, apparently unrelated vignettes, all contributing to the overall story in unexpected ways. catch it if you see it, otherwise wait for the rent.
