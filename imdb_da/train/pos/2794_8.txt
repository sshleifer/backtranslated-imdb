How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This makes it with an almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures do not want their daughters to be breastfed. Here we see a bunch of excellent actors that we have never heard of before, depicting people from different cultures living fairly humble lives until their female children want and have the potential to become professional football players. The structure around the parallel between the two cultures is wonderful. There is no abandonment. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both are also stupid). A mistake: The Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives, but not a child among them.
