I saw this movie in joy. <br /> <br /> This may be one of the best movies all the time. It has a timeless value that you can get so much out of it, it's great. There are parts that move, fun and just good. All aspects are spot on, the story is perfect, every detail is 100% real, even small Irish features have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high shots gives two great views on Cristy (beware). Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I've never seen an actor ever do it. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> And it's so good to see, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing you can get to the real life experience. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, see it. Have no doubt there is something for everyone.
