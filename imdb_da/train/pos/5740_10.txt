The emotional forces and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things Hollywood does no more. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and heartfelt movies I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce, and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, delivers Oscar Winning caliber performances! There are not enough words to express how big this movie is. Of course, people who are not in sentimental movies cannot care about Dominick and Eugene as much as the rest of us, but for the rest of us, this film goes straight to the heart and compassion and compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, EVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS UNDER ***** <br /> <br /> The simple yet eloquent story is told here. Eugene is an in-school intern who faces long hours and a demanding workload in the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a little slow and awkward due to brain damage due to a victim of abuse by their father. (A heartbreaking moment when this is found out of the movie that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (aa "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He has to decide whether to finish the medical school, which would mean accepting his stay in another city and leaving Dominick (i.e. Nicky) or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay her brother's schooling by working as a bin. <br /> <br /> The issues of ethics, morals and responsibilities are blatantly mixed in this landmark film. When Gino thinks Nicky can make progress toward independence, Dominick turns around and does things like helping a drug dealer or commit to using a defective cord he finds in the dump on an electrical appliance. <br /> <Larry is "The Character" and Nicky's partner on his trash can, which equally dominates Dominick's head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend as he guides clinical pharmacology) going to Atlantic City and play away all their money. But deep down, you can see that Larry cares for him. On their rounds, Nicky is also friendly with a little boy we find out has also been beaten by his father. An end result is also tragic, and the pain that you see on Nicky's face when it happens, speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity of the two brothers to each other cannot be overstated. All Nicky wants to do is to be loved and look for acceptance in what he can. (ie he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything else in the world. But can his brother become independent enough, so Geno can pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have gotten more accolades than it deserved, but unfortunately came out at the same time as Rain Man, who dealt with a similar problem. However, I like Dominick and Eugene because it has a much stronger emotional component. Be aware that this movie is aimed straight at the tear channels, so Kleenex has a handy! What a movie !!!!
