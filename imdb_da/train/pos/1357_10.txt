Wow what an episode! After last week watching Mellisa constantly make cameos about the friendship Annie and Brandi, I almost ran out. But it was nothing until you saw Mellisa's tirade after being fired. When she hobbled around her thrown spears out obscenities and screamed for someone to get her bag out the absolute hilarious thing ever on reality TV. She continued to scream at people to get her clothes "all" as someone else would wear one of her scary clothes. Mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums? Then Joan begins to call Annie and Brandie every name in the book and get up and stop the show! Both rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show for as long as keeping ratings up. Mellisa cries and refuses to make an exit interview, just turns to America, what everyone thought you were a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can't get my way! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa to think, and it did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest competitor and deserves to win the whole game.
