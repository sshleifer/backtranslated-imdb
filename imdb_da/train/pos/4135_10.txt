This is an absolutely charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespeare work, he shows in this movie that he is by no means limited to playing only classical theater. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce lawyer who tries to avoid women and their treacherous ways to the loving puppy who falls for Lady X, as Merle Oberon plays effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting. Ralph Richardson was also happy to see. I highly recommend it.
