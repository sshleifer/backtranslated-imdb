My observations: Postwar hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa from "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton good as always; less part than in the "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington way more beautiful, even assuming perky little nose was missing by Hamilton. The tent scene at the end with the previous boy next door was funny. As a two-year veteran of mourning, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I used to work in a department store and it was as elegant as this. Unfortunately, it has disappeared and faded into turbidity. We were famous for the big show windows used to lure passers-by in the store to get them to buy all the wonderful items. <br /> <br /> 10/10
