But it's a little fun, at least if you grew up on Weird Al, as I did. It's a mockumentary about his life and his career, beginning with superstars and going back to track the origins. It is uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very fun, especially when he goes to Japan. Although it is not as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and he does not find love, but fleeting, he takes in a bottle the completely bizarre cultural melange that is Tokyo street life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Weird Al is not recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he might be a rose with no other name smell just as sweet. Still, this is a fun movie.
