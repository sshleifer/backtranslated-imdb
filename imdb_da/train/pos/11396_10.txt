Released two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning movie has it all - sumptuous Technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking filmography, stunning wall-to-wall Gershwin music, superior choreography, lighter end-air plays and great performances by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood is no longer doing them here. It's definitely my favorite movie all the time, a standard where I judge all other movies. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy!
