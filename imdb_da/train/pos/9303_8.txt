When you watch this movie, be aware that it is not a normal movie. It has no real story just characters, a bunch of gangster characters that come together in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lie and listen. The film stands out, so it is difficult to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the user's comments on this movie are so mixed. <br /> <br /> I love a movie and recommend it to anyone who loves one-liners and things that differ from "normal". You can't really put your finger on what's so wonderful about it, it's just a comic world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
