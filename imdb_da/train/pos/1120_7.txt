Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this rare grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher. The plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a monastery are planning the spring break in life in Florida, but they are scheduled when one of them witnesses a man who kills a local woman, and when he understands that he was seen, let us Just say it becomes deadly game with cat and mouse, and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff. In my opinion, Grave is one of the more comfortable slashers that came out in the 80s, especially in the late 80s, which was when the slashers went downhill, it was one of the few that did not That, and this movie should be more known, it's a shame, it's not. This is a movie that actually interferes with stereotypes (just try to guess who the final girl is going to be - I'm wrong). The principle is all tasteful, and it is one of the movies that you just hope they all get away, which of course they don't. This combined with the fluency of the film's first fifty jars (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (the other murder gives a real shake) and some unexpected sleaziness (although this is not high budget thriller I don't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast), in a late 80s movie). There is one or two bad things about this movie, not bad just less, as the subplot with the two teenage boys who do not go anywhere and the end, which was stupid and plus the substitute inability to follow the logic. There are no sharp tools in SHALLOW GRAVE, but at least it is a slasher flick through and through. The scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the vicious Sheriff are tense and exciting. All in all, a very enjoyable and worthy slasher with great performances from all four main girls and the psychic sheriff.
