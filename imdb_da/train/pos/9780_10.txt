I watched this movie at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, a stylish and imaginative shocker, is one of the scariest flicks I've seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a large selection of good actors (as an example: Peter Martell as European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, great production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx as Italian horror films in the eighties. Meat skinned clean to the bone ... and the blood runs red ... this wild Heart Stopper will grab you ... and give you some dark dreams ... A must-see !!
