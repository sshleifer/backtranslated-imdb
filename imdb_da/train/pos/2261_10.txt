I saw this movie and the play, and I must add that this was the most touching story I had ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I wasn't aware of how terrible life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults who were and were living in that time. It brought tears to my eyes and much sorrow for my heart that every man should have to fight so just to be alive and to bring the children right out of this area and teach them to act and preform and transform them to tell Their own story is simply amazing. This only surpasses a five star, I judge it a ten. Thanks Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lies heavily in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD out there on the piece, please let me know. Thanks. PS There was nothing wrong with the kids who would draw attention to their problems and relationship with other countries' attention in the hope that some would have a heart and offer help.
