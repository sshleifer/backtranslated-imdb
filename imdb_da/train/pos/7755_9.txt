"Written in the Wind" is an irresistible, wonderfully kinky movie, as only Director Sirk could have done it. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, weird melodramatic and colorful contrasts. The link between economic success and moral decline is the film's main theme. Sirk seems to indicate that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to watch the film as a good example of what Sirk could do with kitschy material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The action in the movie is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the movie belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (she has earned The Best Supporting Actress Oscar), which manages to keep the film boiling point. Kudos to Frank Skinner's vibrant score, Russell Metty's brilliant camera work (every shot is a masterpiece in itself) and production design department. Also the title melody is a beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
