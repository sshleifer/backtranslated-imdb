I love so much this movie! The animation is fantastic (for a pok√©mon movie), cgi looks so great. I love the music in the movie. So great they kept the Japanese music. <br /> <br /> With regard to history: the great. It has a good sense of friendship. Celebi is a very sweet and powerful pokemon. Ask is really amazing in this movie and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I didn't like was Suicune's appearance, he suddenly jumps up, helps Ash & Co a little and leaves. They could have made their role in the film a little bigger. <br /> <br /> But overall, great movie! Can't wait to own the USA version on DVD!
