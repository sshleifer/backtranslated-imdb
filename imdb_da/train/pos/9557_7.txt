I love this anime! I laughed my head with all the jokes and violence (mainly from Akane Ranma's reluctant but short-haired "fianc√©") so slapstick, but Ranma deserves it, but he tries his best to make changes ... wise. The protagonist Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the damned Jusenkkyo spring and become a girl when it is sprinkled with cold water. From then on, it is pure chaos one after another. Among the stand outs is the horrible brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy shampoo, perverted Happosai all cause problems for our hero / heroine. But it is Ranma's selfish father Genma who is winning the culprit most of the time. If anyone wants an anime that's fun, it's this one. It's better and better with the Japanese dub.
