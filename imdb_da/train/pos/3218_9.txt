Nine out of ten may seem like a high mark to give a straight to video sci-fi movies that have become confused at the American Picture Office and critically criticized as the worst movie of Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, when reading negative reviews of this movie, they usually start with the nature of the tree by Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier. I'm also going to start here with my surprising statement that this is perhaps the finest piece of play I've seen Russell pull off. Todd is an emotional creep and suffers from intense PTSD - this film is written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now. The depiction is spot on. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety - typed into a fever height by training that teaches him to analyze any movement and interaction with another person for evidence of fraud and danger. His hyperfocus brings with it an inability to understand the larger continuum that the tasks he is given to do lie within - there is a scene where he cuts himself and cuts carrots and continues to work idle and does not clear the cut or blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focuses on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he simply performs the desired task of mess - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables he prepares and the food that will be eaten later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is spartan to say the least - the two great talking scenes he gets are central to the movie's plot and both emphasize the grim nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always. Fear of keeping him pumped up to a hyper alarm state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to respond to a knife edge. Discipline to keep him in control through his fear, overcoming it and performing tactically. The introduction is that he does not have time to think and cannot afford emotions. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug of Nielsen's Sandra - but I think you should interpret it from a person's perspective, which is only an experience of embrace, is in battle - the quake represents him who suppresses his struggle / Flight instinct responds to fear of being joked, limited his movement and vision - fear and discipline indeed. <br /> <br /> there is the subtitle of his mission (twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to throw infantry on the dirt of society when they have earned their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up Mace's responsibility for his wife and child - desperately needing a mission, even one with such a likelihood of his death. <br /> <br /> There is also the military subtitle - the conflict between Busey's church and the hotshot from HQ, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more precise and aggressive. Any of them could beat Todd in the ground - but it's not about the tools you have, that's how you use them. An incentive Todd, who has the freedom to exercise his initiative and act without the emotional impact of perceived superiority, uses ambush tactics and insidious tricks to cut a swim through the newer entity - sent without support, coverage, or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot compensate for lack of leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle themes. When a movie is shot and written so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. See open minded soldier and see what it teaches you.
