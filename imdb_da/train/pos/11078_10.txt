I saw movies today and it just blew my mind away. It's a real work of art and I don't understand why most people think it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego away, and then you get true power! This was the main battle at the end of the movie, and Guy Ritchie has shown it in a magnificent way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever see" - can you remember it from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... The voice that always tells us that we are important, gives us our pride, it does not tell us to give, but only to take that which causes our aggression that Want to be in control that creates all the negative emotions and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to achieve genuine control is when you lose control and you simply release your personal meaning. A great movie!
