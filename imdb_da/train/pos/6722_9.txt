Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to big), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). What is missing is a major question of sociological significance: chucking mainstream American culture for something more satisfying and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm movies at the local colleges in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated warmth, put on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and wanted to see the latest surfing movie at night. Often the narrator himself was the filmmaker and read a script out of sheet of paper. Sometimes a surf band or proto-punk band will add music. I was never happier. Apart from hooting and hollering, I saw that 'Riding Giants' took me back in time. It also strengthens the feeling of living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the Joneses, pushing you physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and rejoicing - may be the answer to the question , "What's the meaning of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: living life solely on our own terms. Perhaps the community would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is great to see people who actually live their dreams. It was this message that really impressed me.
