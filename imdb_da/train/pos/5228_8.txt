I found this movie hilarious. Spoofs on other popular movies from that time were some of the funniest I've seen in this kind of movie. Try it. If you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing and you get humor, you should enjoy the movie. I (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie (this is not a spoiler because I won't tell you what actually happens) was a flashy thingy scene from the MIB. When they first discover the device and not know what it is doing ... and then later in the movie ... you understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie is that I have never been able to find it in DVD so I could buy a copy.
