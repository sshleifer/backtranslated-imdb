The late, big Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those of you who didn't pay attention) portrayed this story of terror and it was definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen as a child. (I had to go MILES just to watch a movie and it was usually dark when I came out of the theater as it was always scary to watch a horror movie, but since it was as well done as this.) When I had the opportunity to see this several years ago on videotape (which must always be a last resort), I was surprised at how well it stopped. Take the terror test: see it at night alone and then tell me it's not scary ...
