In the beginning, this movie seems so bad that I almost fell into trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic drill. But I gave it a try, then another and another, etc. Finally, I became dependent on this movie because of the dreamless slow pace, wonderful natural set, bathed in a mild autumn lamp, and especially musical score made by 70 's progressive rock and absolutely exquisite folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (Troubadour). You should notice the song of hazelnut, silver trout and lady disappearing in the air ..., heard in the middle and at the end of the movie. There are some scary scenes in the beginning that allowed us to appreciate Elizabeth Suzuki's natural charm. If that film was made by some "repertoire" directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would have rolled on the floor and rave over the movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece. Personally, I think this movie is a million times better than any of Fellini's cinematic sh # Â¤ @ t! Absolutely not for the pretentious.
