A prequel to the renowned Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick as well as the new series co-creator Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is set in the twelve colonies about 58 years prior to the events in Battlestar Galactica. The new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the most important steps in the development of what would become the Cylon race. <br /> <br /> The pilot and series are set to follow two families; Graystonen, which includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while Adama's includes Joseph (Esai Morales) a lawyer and his son William, the future admiral for Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some good experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker as well as some very talented relatively new players, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities to that series, but it is also very different. In the pilot, the science science elements are absolutely present, but are smaller part of this series. The scenarios at Caprica, while reflecting a more technologically advanced society, also have retro feel, this is achieved through part of the architecture, costumes and the way it is shot. <br /> <br /> While the appearance of the two series has some significant differences some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme is rarely touched in BG is much more important. We also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul, and whether a machine can have one, as well as issues related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The pilot has been released directly to DVD in an expanded and unauthorized version before viewing on television, the series is set to start in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, this series is filmed in Vancouver
