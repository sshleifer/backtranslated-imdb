I recently found this movie on VHS after looking for it for years, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov stars and co-wrote the original manuscript (nominated for an Oscar). Other stars you have heard of are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / editor, just published from England's infamous Wormwood Scrubs prison (he was banned from the Conservative party's headquarters, chosen because he is a liberal). He immediately begins a search for a new employer, which he can subdue, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He social engineers enter a London men's club and learn the identity of the best computer experts in the city, he steals the identity of a Caesar Smith who has just left the city for South America to pursue his hobby of collecting turbines in the wild . He talks his way into Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Clamps employ Smith and show him around the computer center, especially its safety feature of a flashing blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his security, and the computer tells him, "Disconnect blue light." Using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future breaks Ustinov into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various fake companies. The scheme begins to rave when Klemper's assistant Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) notes the amount of business that Ta-Can-Co appears to trade with Ustinov's scams. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever. To tell you how would spoil this very fun, romantic, intelligent and forward-looking image.
