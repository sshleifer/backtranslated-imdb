I found Gray Garden to be a gripping movie, an incredible intimate <br /> <br /> watch for excentrics that basically have the right idea: forget the community and live in a delapidated house without heating and a huge cat and raccoons who care for their own interests rather <br /> <br /> constantly chattering at the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that Mazles Bros. has chosen to document. <br /> <br /> They look like characters out of a <br /> <br /> Fellini movie, just alien if it makes sense. Old Edie is almost entirely bedding, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes <br /> <br /> growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She <br /> <br /> boasts around the house, always wearing a baboushka-like <br /> <br /> headgear around her head that completely covers her hair. We <br /> <br /> never see her hair through the movie, nor do we get a tip <br /> <br /> that she still has a lot. However, at age 48, she is still <br /> <br /> beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In Gray Gardens we get the feeling that both of these women are <br /> <life has become much smaller than they once were. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the sadder of the two. While her mother married in her previous years, made a family, lived luxuriously and even made some recordings (the scene where she sings 77 years <<br /> along with a recording of "Tea for Two" she made) Decades ago, one of the movie's best scenes, Edie left his promising career as a <br /> <br /> model to take care of her unhappy mother. At 58, she still wanted to <br /> <br /> find her prince charming. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame and of domestic and romantic <br /> <br /> happiness yet to be fulfilled. <Br /> <br /> The highlights of the movie include the opening moments where Little <br /> <br /> Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the "te to two" sequence, <br /> <br /> birthday party, the climatic argument, the merchant delivers scene <br /> <br /> and the stage in the ceiling. It's all amazing <br /> <br /> honest and inaccurate. And it is made even more recognizable as it is quite right. <br /> <br /> I suggest seeing Gray Gardens back-to-back with Kenneth <br /> <br /> Specifying Short Puce Moment. Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but it's worth every penny.
