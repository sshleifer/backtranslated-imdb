Having developed a critical eye for movies and a love of good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my spiritual symbolic team. While I'm an unimaginable fan of Denzel Washington - both his skills as an actor and his public persona; I'm an honest enough fan to admit to the (very few) times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a movie or two. And I could be wrong with them - after all, I'm not an actor. But it was different - Denzel would be pioneering her career experience and managing one of the most sensitive issues you knew about - a child's abuse. Like his direct debut, no less. And develop the film to point out that it will successfully present a man's triumph. I would not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I wasn't. <br /> <br /> What I saw is a movie full of promise that connects different audiences and gave the inexperienced viewer a short but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed after all. This movie did it - and it was a dry eye of any color in the theater that showed it. It requires someone to know the topics in this movie to know when the truth is presented. It requires a talented filmmaker to tell the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it. And if he can further draw an audience in and make an audience feel emotionally, without shame, the filmmaker has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. That's what makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you've actually won.
