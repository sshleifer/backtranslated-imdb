Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are the sequel to Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Their fake journey follows almost immediately after the first movie and does just as well for a job if it is not better to entertain the viewer. The reason is a vicious person from the future trying to kill Bill and Ted using evil robots that look like Bill and Ted. When the robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with the ugly reaper (death) and return their lives to normal. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie is top notch, and even thought it is a bit odd at times, especially Bill and Ted's conversations, it's a great movie. Wannabe rockers have probably made another great movie. Choose it the next time you are on blockbuster!
