I totally agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. As I said before, I remember seeing that I was looking at, and thought it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the history of the colony incredible, but I remember the music as being so much a part of its appeal. If I remember correctly, it was native pipe (related to the music at the end of One Flew Over Cookoo's Nest). I have also been looking for a copy. It must be necessary to look at someone, but especially the schools. It should be republished.
