This was one of the best war movies I have seen because it focuses on the characters more than the current war. All the casting does an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more credible. Camera recording is great, it was also pacing and editing. This movie actually comes to you and makes the audience look after the charters.
