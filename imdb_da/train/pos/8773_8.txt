Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 movie boxer Jim Corbett, known as the man who beat John L. Sullivan. Directly with a light hand of Flynn's good friend, Raoul Walsh, the star is also Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious, selfish young man who has a natural boxing talent and is sponsored by the exclusive San Francisco Olympic Club in the late 1800s. Although good-natured, the fact is that he is a "shanty Irish" and a social climber, anger at Olympic Club members; Most of them can't wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him. Despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor. Finally, he gets the chance he has been waiting for, a battle with world champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan requires a $ 10,000 deposit to make sure Corbett is struggling for $ 25,000 purse. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) despaired to get the money. However, help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie, and Jim Corbett is an excellent role for Flynn, who himself was a professional fighter at one time. He has the necessary charm, good looks and athleticism for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest, insisting that she hates him. In fact, she didn't seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is Corbett and his career rather than the history of the box. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is considered the man who made prizefighting an art form. In the film, Corbett is flooded and avoids being hit by his opponents; It is believed that he was wearing down John L. Sullivan in this way. <br /> <br /> Good movie to catch Flynn at the height of his too short time as superstar.
