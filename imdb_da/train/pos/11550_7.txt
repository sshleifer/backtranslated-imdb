If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good movie, which is not a small feat considering the coma, I was put in by the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this movie has a sad beginning that wasn't even extremely fun or even optimistic. When things get messy, however, you're back with a comedy that still stops well after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who would like to see their previous work.
