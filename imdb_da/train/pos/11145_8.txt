After racism, rural areas - also known as migration by the country - are another socio-political issue from the 1960s. The WestSide Story had dealt with racism at a love party in an artistic view. Midnight Cowboy now employs the rural areas of a friendship drama in a psychological view. It has a deeply daunting end that we witness one of the two fates that pass by. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger gives us in-depth secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums. While the beautiful Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women in the world ask him to share a wild love fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in pure and sunny Florida. Therefore, Joe becomes a hustler to make his fantasies a reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to raise enough money to migrate to Florida. Besides Ratso, Joe helps find his way to do what he can. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, they share medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their earnings and thus share a destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe recognizes that it is beautiful not only to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and moreover, Ratso cannot see Florida when his heart did not defeat his illness while on the bus and took him there. <br /> <br /> Might is always right and Feeble has no right in daylight. From there, "Midnight" gives the actual sight. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Each aspect of each character is the reality of the poor, which carries their inevitable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative perception of a socio-political issue, rural.
