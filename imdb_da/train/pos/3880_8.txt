Well, first of all, it was actually the most elegant Clausen movie to this date. The man always has a sense of character with a sense of humor to them, but I think he in this movie adds a dimension that is infinite with something he has previously done. His work has - in very black n 'white words - been accepted by the broad but not the critical audience, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a clear way to let the audience know what to say. <br /> <br /> In "Villa Paranoia", however, for the first time he surprises himself with an invisible wisdom and respect for the minorities. Not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget. Seen in Jutland - in the 'country' - it's about the eternal question of lack of love, but in a close and sometimes brutal way that keeps you looking and keeping you focused. And in addition, even manage to play ab ****** d! A true b ***** d who wants the right thing but has no idea how to get there and people are suffering. Bitterly. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I expect his next one to be strong.
