This may not be one of the best films ever made, but in general it is a very comfortable, pleasing foam, where everyone involved seems to be doing well. Highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. OK, so Frank Sinatra's "acting" leaves much to be desired, but his song is a great redeeming feature, and the songs fit perfectly into the film's romantic atmosphere. Sinatra continued to make many more films in which his undoubted behavior shone through, but in this is his first venture to Hollywood, his voice, not his acting, his main contribution to this movie. I've just seen it again on TV, and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time I saw it many many years ago.
