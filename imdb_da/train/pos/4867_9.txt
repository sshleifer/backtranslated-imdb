Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire with a foggy day and several other dances, a duo with an unlucky Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what is essentially "scene" dances in a cleaner form than in his movie with Ginger Rogers, and before learning to take full advantage of the film's potential. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their comedy career for radio / spouse does the kind of dance they must have done in vaudeville and didn't have the opportunity to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s . (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points in the movie and worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm up to the "Chin up" exciting carnival number where the three sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth staying under the "plot". I've seen this a 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.
