'Iphigenia' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterful game is masterfully adapted to the screen and created to life by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis achieved the impossible. He managed to film a Greek tragedy on the screen without losing his efficiency and importance. A stellar Greek cast helps him with this. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Just as impressive is Irene Papas, who, although she sometimes seems over the top, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis, which is ideal in all scenes. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rookies say the movie lost the best foreign language film Oscar with only 1 vote !!!
