We loved the movie. I'm a mother of two little men. I love having a movie I can see with them where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important. And family is forever, and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we saw more of the Davis family. But over all that I loved, I left the same feeling, the others did "please, don't be over". We both want actors not to change. The new actors were good substitutes tho. My 9 year old son also loved this movie. asked me to buy them all. He is a film critic, so he says it tells me something. Family should all see this step buy it for friends. Help return a time of values. We read the books now as we are hooked. really hope to see more. Blessed happy
