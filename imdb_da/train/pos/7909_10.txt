When this first came out, my father took it home - we were amazed at it - it was so different from what we had seen before. I was looking for a particular movie last night and I found the "Mind of the Mind" again. The box falls apart and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it's not the Finding Nemo quality graphics, it's still very good. They should sell this again - it is a landmark for computer animation images.
