and what a combo. Two of the great singers of the century stand together in this undervalued musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone, who can't write either because his wife died (actually she just became obese!). Best scene is the farmhouse number, where Bing sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments out of hock. Just wonderful. And this is a rare lead role for Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again the manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram co-star. And who knew Rathbone could be fun?
