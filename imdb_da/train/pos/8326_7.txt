Man Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." Don't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein and tries to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton maths candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. Of course, a bit of the movie is historically accurate, but it's not the intention. It is not meant to be anything but a light comedy, the opposite of Robbin's most famous 1994 movie (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's whole life should not only focus on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and came across nuclear weapons (it came to the point where the FBI filed a file him). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
