With fantastic filmography and a thread of the kafkaesque absurdity, this film had me from the simple but fascinating opening scene. The movie plays a lot like a dream, and I think it may be why people either hate it or love it. Characters are sketched superficially, and the story itself is small and perhaps a little pointless. But these are mistakes in the movie, but conscious choices. The film work does not attempt to function as a story, but rather is a deconstruction of the 1940s war film. <br /> <br /> I would have trouble arguing that there was very real substance for the movie, but the film is such a cinematic wonder that I was totally swept away. This is one of the most beautiful filmed movies ever and there is a wild fantasy in its style. I can quite understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.
