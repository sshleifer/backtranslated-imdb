I saw this in Detroit in what must have been its original race. I literally rolled into the theater. It was so funny. I haven't seen it since, but would love that. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says something that is dated or exaggerated is for my money just a bunch of poseurs. Each shit is either vicious, erotic or perverted fun. Each and every one! There is not a weak one included. The open sequence, for example, as parody 2001, has gorilla go-go dancers with pendulous breasts. Felinni would have filmed it if he had the evil white. If you come to this movie with an open mind and a blithely slanting heart, you will pen it right into your very best list.
