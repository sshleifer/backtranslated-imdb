My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to watch this movie and was delighted with the great movie experience. It has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the movie and especially Hallie Kate Eisenbergs refrain, "Boys are so weird." It is refreshing to watch a movie that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are actually different in their emotional and social makeup. The boys really do these kind of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers stupidly! We have had the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend, myself and my daughters, 23 year old girlfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guy's day out. We had even more fun the second time and everyone raved about it. It is clean and lovely occupied by a pre-adolescent cast, reminiscent of TV Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel it is getting stuck here, not unlike "Freaks & Geeks" who didn't survive their first season but sold their DVD release. See it especially if you have boys and you find it stimulating the conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love it because of the opportunity it says to say, "The boys are so weird!" Do not miss it ...
