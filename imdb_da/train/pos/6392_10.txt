This independent B&W, DV has consistent shock, surprise and amuse with its ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. It's all funny and ridiculous things, but anyway, as absurd, so much of the movie has to be, there's a heart and a reality here that keeps the movie grounded, keeps the whole piece from slipping to complete madness and there is the real message here . This film is about how we all survive in a world that has gone crazy. It seems to be the heart of the movie. Because so insane and outside the wall that things get, Leon, 30 years. old paper boy protagonist, always trying to keep it together. He is like a child to always try to catch the balloon that floats away, so that everything will work optimally so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie could have been far above the top, but the unusual casting really keeps the piece coherent. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the pile here with a show that shines through its absurd sick tics. Like the characters in the movie, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person downstairs. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. He takes the utterly ridiculous phrases and keeps them real. It's his scripts and his throws that help keep it all fleeting. It is a true testament to Majkowski's skill and all involved that this film, with its lattice plot and characters, never once works our nerves. Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and contradictory and somehow gave it heart and humor. This is a unique movie. Not to be missed. <br /> <br />
