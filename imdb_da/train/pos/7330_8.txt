This movie is based on Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are straight out of his paintings (the dead dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of original art. Bakshi is known for his great use of the rotoscope (the technique of tracking a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. But since the film is quite realistic (all characters are human), it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story of interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really disgusting villain and a beautiful baby. This movie has the feel of the best Conan comics, not surprisingly, as Roy Thomas is the author of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is far from the crappy live-action Conan, not to mention all B movies in the genre. <br /> <br /> Absolutely recommended!
