This is one of the little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck who decides money is not enough so he rents the family who lives where he believed HANS family did. OKAY? This is a great little high school soap, PG-13, but the little sex references are comedy, so if your child can't handle them, they can't live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a hunk, and as usual goes through this fun, OMG, remember when we did ... the ensemble piece as if he were in the final stages of a neuro-infectious disease. But that's okay, because even though this old Oracle continues to hope that Ben is so well proportioned everywhere, there is hope for us ladies yet. Fortunately, the rest of the ensemble - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier, and Josh Zuckerman - fill in and hold this shadow-side-Ozzie-and-Harriet Christmas alternately fun, comfortable, and warm. <br /> <br /> This movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone would like to back up to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is a happy movie and it makes you feel comfortable with life, love, family, Christmas and chanel. There is really something for everyone.
