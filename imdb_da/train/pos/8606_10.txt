It seems there is no slot on this movie! Most of it is done in a dream, and like most dreams it is often silly and illogical. It is also a beautiful production with some good songs and fine performances, especially of our angel. Jeanette's deadpan, unconscious insults and various other faux pas on dream reception are fun, and her jitter bow with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a joy. At one point, she will sing some distance from Carmen, followed by Faust's last trio (with a lapdog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - great entertaining if you can get into the groove.
