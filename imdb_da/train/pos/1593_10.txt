The show is about two sisters living together. Holly is the youngest having some teenage problems on the other hand her sister Val has jobs, boy friend, fianc√© problems like most of the women on the planet. They try to support each other, they make mistakes sometimes, but they do not give up and continue. And the performance is also about friendship. The priorities of life. I loved this show so much. It's fun and the actors are so good. I'm really sorry the show is over. I still see rerun's time :) :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth can be new to comedy, but she plays really well. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I like Vince and Holly's relationship, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he comes up. With Tina Holly found a real friend and I like those who hang out. Lauren's character is so much fun, and she is a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really takes you in and makes you laugh. I want the show not been over.
