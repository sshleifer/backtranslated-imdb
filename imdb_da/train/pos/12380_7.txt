NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) hires a room in an old brown, where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some eerie hallucinations. As a lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) goes on to address her, she struggles to maintain her hygiene (not to mention her willingness to live), as her experiences take a toll on her physical, mental and emotional health . /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror movie for those who are not familiar with it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the film does not really give much in the form of real scares. Or for that matter any atmosphere. It's obviously scary, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It is more a story of a troubled woman's attempt to deal with the rising unreality of her life. At this level, it works, but it's not quite strong enough. What "The Sentinel" * makes * offers are some eye-catching pieces (especially the fascinating, fabulous spooky climax and there is a scene with Beverly D'Angelo that must be seen as believed). There is also something to see, but not much. A malicious music score by Gil Melle adds to the threat. <br /> <br /> No review of this movie would be complete without an assessment for the filmmakers in gathering such excellent ensemble cast actors. Some of them do not get too much, but to see them all is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impression, respectively, as a hard-nose detective and an appealing neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars like D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum make short exhibits, and other well-known faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Anyone who was the casting director of this movie deserves some sort of prize. <br /> <br /> Written for the play by director Michael Winner, probably best known for the "Death Wish" series, which he did with Charles Bronson, from the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't consider this a really big horror thriller, but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining. <br /> <br /> 7/10
