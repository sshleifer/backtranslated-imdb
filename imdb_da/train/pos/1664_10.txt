I thought this movie was great, with excellent performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with preliminary but confidential fashion, her hands map out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion that Artemisia gives to his art is just spectacular to see. <br /> <br /> Although not every character was obviously beautiful, it made the movie more realistic, as facial hair and clothing were perfect at that time. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought this movie was great.
