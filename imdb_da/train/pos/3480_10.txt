This is the best comedy I've ever seen! But not everyone can understand this, you must be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) All in all one of the best movies I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors who play very well, but to perform by Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is in my opinion best working with supporting the role in film history :)) in this movie many Georgian stars play like ipolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... they all are stars in Georgian filmography :) plus in this movie plays great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course director of the movie Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this movie to everyone, but remember that you need to know good Russian language to watch this movie
