Since it has been a few years since I reviewed this classic, I have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those I grew up with, it made my childhood happy, it made it great, miss some of these things today that we clearly don't see so much as we came back in the days, well forward to the review ... <br /> <br /> Speech Spin or the Air Heroes, as it is called in Denmark, is a large animated series, it is much like chip and dale, ducktales and many of the old, so it has the strange feeling about it, I can't remember this series as much as I want to remember it. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, it was very good that it came with some kind of message, not so much of a message, but it is one of the old ones so it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I don't want to sound old or anything, but I want the time to slip out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or something else weird , we all have these new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana or something, but I do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows as we did in early days. <br /> <br /> Now I might be wrong, but I feel like time has changed too much. Finally, I would be thrilled to see these series as Talespin being released again to the TV screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids, I have a day, give them back .. .
