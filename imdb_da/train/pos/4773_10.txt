Nice piece of good cinema. This is one of the movies you see smiling and you don't know why. Well, one of the reasons may be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today and he is able to film emotions. <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, you can feel what Mr. Straight was the feeling when he made the decision to visit his brother with his "marvelous" John Deere. What has changed in his mind? What changed in your thoughts when you saw this movie? <br /> <br /> A beautiful fraternal love story.
