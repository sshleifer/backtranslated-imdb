What a fun filled, sexy movie! They certainly don't make them like this any more. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. The tone is oddly innocent as the significant nudity unfolds out of stock farcical situations, rather than any overtly sexual desire in the characters. It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become violent. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film certainly confuses the origin of the softcore function as lying in nudie cuties and natural films from the old school. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress has ever seen better naked (she is slim but wonderfully curvy) or dressed, come to it (I have loved her since the original round of the UFO - who else could wear a purple wig!), I eat my hat.
