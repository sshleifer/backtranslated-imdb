Single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself in work with several minimum wage jobs. When fired, she finds that she cannot support her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts) if the latter has asthma. Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. Soon she will become dependent on the drugs she sells. Her life comes down, especially when her children, her eldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. Then she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the addicts she was working for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has some of the best plays I've ever seen! Diane Keaton takes over a lot and her character comes out so crazy, but she was extremely convincing. She is much better suited to drama than to comedy. But the best performance in the movie comes from Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. He is perfect as the responsible son, who is still young, but tries to be the adult in the family. His performance was particularly great in the scenes, where he confronted his mother with the substances. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a good job. <br /> <br /> A movie worth seeing, especially due to Michael Seater and Diane Keaton performances!
