Yeah right. Sammo Hung was already starring in 1983's "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain". Now 2001 he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time he finally does the right thing. You rarely see him in wuxia, more often in classic eastern or criminal slapstick. But this role simply suits him! The ancient Chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies (as far as I know about movies translated into the west). Although the legend contains a large number of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: You haven't seen a story the same in a modern movie! And it does so well! And wow: all the colors plus the immensely deep, right-of-heart story makes you fall to this movie in an instant. The first time I looked at it, I had to see it again immediately, and I did. Okay, I didn't understand all that first time. But it only makes it better! You know you didn't understand it because there is so much spice in it! Therefore, it is a pleasure for one to see it again and again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you see it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story to love, characters you cry with and really: a movie you never forget! - Editor note: Well, I think I'll see it right now again: D
