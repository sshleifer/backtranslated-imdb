I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, great !! .. Tom Cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say .. I was totally blown away by the movie and especially TC's performance, I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not at all I expected. <br /> <br /> I had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it, I am so glad I was forced to see it. The strange thing is that I can't say why, all I can say is that I found it quite involved and couldn't stop thinking about it the next day. What I felt about the movie is all I can say about it, it's not the story (fantasy, psychodrama, anything) it's about the people and events that shape their lives and how small events like entering a car can change everything ...... what the critics wrote, maybe the original was a great second movie to Alejandro Amen√°bar, but it was a completely different interpretation of the subject and in no way a narcissistic remake in favor of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can't even consider writing a few trite, glib phrases to describe the movie just go and see it !! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know this is not a balanced thought-provoking review, but what. It's not that kind of movie.
