What is most disturbing about this movie is not that the school kills sprees as it actually portrays, but the truth is that they are performed by teens like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Ben Coccio using a handheld camera technique manages to bring us into the lives of two friends who have some problems with the high school, even though we are never ever told what lies behind those problems. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? Some of you just don't think they will ever do the very thoughtful massacre at Zero Day. The scenes of the surveillance cameras at school during the recording are made so stronger for that reason. You can't believe it really happens and it really happened. Handheld camera technology also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie, a brilliant idea given to the subject.
