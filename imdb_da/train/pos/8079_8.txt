Not many reviews, therefore I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO TO THE OTHER RESERVATIONS! This was an excellent movie. RKS is one of the very few Indian directors who can actually put together a really good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave another example of great as well as bhoomika, which was a little unexpected but fantastic to see. <br /> <br /> Surprised, there hasn't been much hype about the release. <br /> <br /> Film movie / other awards nominate, considering how good the movie was. Better then Khakee, I thought, and I thought Khakkee was also a good movie. Is a pretty long movie, but definitely worth it and while you see it, it seems to be long. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for RKS next film and the next AB, Akshay movie they always seem to work well together ... for example. waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also performed really well in the film and should do very well if she continues in the same way in the future.
