A young and seemingly promising college student (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row. Sean Connery plays the lawyer who is "happy, fortunate" who the grandmother's grandmother jumps out of retirement and usually takes the case in the hope of releasing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on debunking a theory that Connery can dig up to try to release the boy, whom he and the entire police department swear, is guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Late Lynne Thigpen co-star in this very intense dramatic thriller.
