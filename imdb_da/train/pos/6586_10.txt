Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever to narrow the edge of the great Basil Rathbone of course, and this is probably the best fit of a Conon-Doyle card story. A length adjustment includes some new plot strings that fit well into the surrounding drama and increase the hatred you feel for Milverton. Excellent performances all the time, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick completely rounded and comfortable in their roles make this a great piece of drama.
