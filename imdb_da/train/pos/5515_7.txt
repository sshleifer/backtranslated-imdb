I read a little on Che before I see the movie and you want to know something he was really for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces did for his people as well as everyone other Hispanics in general! Now I don't know about others, but for me he did the right thing by having socialism so everyone had to pay their fair share. But, of course, the powerful elite would not go after it. So, instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work as there were too many of his other followers who only took up where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As far as I'm concerned, and as Che said it himself just before he died, "If you kill me, it's fine. But you just kill a man, you'll never kill the cause!" I couldn't have said better myself. <br /> <br /> But ... Whatever .... That's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
