Eytan Fox did it again: Move the viewer's heart into a modest story that takes place in an overwhelming mess. The film also manages to describe the perfect and subtle atmosphere of the incredible city that is Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago, and that's all there: the lifestyle, relationships, beating the city, the mess, the shock of utopian minds in the most light heart, blithe and ignorant megalopolis ever. Highly recommended: it is a journey of the heart and mind with an interesting perspective to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Bene: There is a central homosexuality in the movie. If you don't think you are too gay, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as "just love". (and calm: chick is also hot!)
