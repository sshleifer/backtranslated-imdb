I wasn't sure for the first time if I looked at a documentary, propaganda, or dramatic presentation. I assume that given the time of production, it was a mixture of all three. Clearly, the dramatic plot was something predictable. But you had a feeling that there would be some interesting scenes when the movie continued. We could see what seemed to be realistic training regimes and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this movie came together for me, was closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I perceived it) that I have not experienced before. You can place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young soldiers. This was mixed with the usual problems of portraying the Japanese soldiers who were capable at one point, as one might think that real Japanese actors would be a little scarce. The film is excellent as a source of the state of American thinking in 1943 as the war led with Japan. Also of interest was a dig in Japanese with regard to the help that the United States gave Japan in recent years.
