Here's a proof of why Mary Pickford was America's Sweetheart. 'In this rather complicated drama, Mary plays the young daughter of a chatter who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "hills". The scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply lovely. She is even willing to take a bath. The fact that Mary was able to pull out this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing and something because of her dimensional stature (5 '). Tess must face many physical and emotional challenges. She does it with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time. Tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone. Why she agrees to help her daughter "hill-tops" is beyond me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close-ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The Danish-born Jean Hersholt is simply fantastic as the villain. The scene where he handles a little baby is enough to get you to throw vegetables (or anything) on ​​the screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) had carried a beard, would he have been a battle for the model used in World War I recruiting posters by Uncle Sam? Will you! <br /> <br /> Although history is a little predictable and slow at first, it is worth investing in your time to see the play or the pure `Americana. 'The movie highlights choices for anyone who involves making another happy and what it is to be a true Christian. Recommended.
