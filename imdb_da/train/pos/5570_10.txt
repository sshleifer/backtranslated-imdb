Sophmoric this movie is. But it's fun when everyone goes out. It shows that the "boy storage room" is played by "the other side". It is good to see that the tide is reversed and how stupid they are. But that's probably not news for most women, because (just ask one), "they've heard them all before". <br /> <br /> See it with a small group or group of mixed sexes and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7% ... can you ever really enjoy them?
