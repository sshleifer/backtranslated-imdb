Alain Chabat is a fine actor, writer and instructor, but perhaps a little rude to take an idea for a story that probably had them rolled in the hallways when Aristophanes still learned that it is' I 'before' e 'except' c '. But as I said, Chabat is a fine actor and he can make charm when he needs to. I am also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg, who also turns to a successful performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the plot is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single. This does not sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off the back, he makes an event with a colleague's sister to ask - for fifteen thousand euros - like her new boyfriend, allows the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him, thus getting him off the hook. Of course, they close together, but along the way there is some underbean and Beatrice dueling, and all things are considered to be a beautifully painless ninety minute and so well done at the French box office that a sequel may not be out of the question.
