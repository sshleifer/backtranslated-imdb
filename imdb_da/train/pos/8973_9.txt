I watched this movie when I was a small child on television (thank you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had nightmares about it for many years afterwards. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's National Film Board's best animators. Pojar was again a mentor and partner for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is obvious but usable. The contradictions of beauty and life (the plant) contrast with the anonymity of the glove's hand. The bad doll hero is condemned despite the lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small space where the action takes place is the character of the whole world. The invasion of the hand is a complete violation of that world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunting movie. I found a copy of this and other great shorts by Trnka in the public library and showed it to my own children. One should see.
