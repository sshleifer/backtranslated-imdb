This movie is by far the cutest one I've seen in a long time! Wonderful animation and cute characters (even the evil ones were sweet!) Made this a total winner in my book and in the books from those I saw it with. I still want to see it again but haven't had time. Better than Toy Story, which was also good, but not good.
