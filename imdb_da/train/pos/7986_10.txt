This is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. It is by far the best thing I have seen depicting the current reality of Latin America ... kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and heartless chaos against innocent victims. In my opinion, Denzel Washinton provides the most moving performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. Cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is amazing as always. Walken shines on the screen for me as no other actor. I would have loved to see more of them both. The authentic places are remarkable. The camera's work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the molding, which makes it even more interesting for people who are familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
