Wilson (Erica Gavin) is nabbed by the police and sent to jail in this smooth and entertaining example of prime 70's exploitation, marking the direct debut of Jonathan Demme. Having written and produced a few mentor Roger Cormans' New World movies, Demme got the opportunity to lead for the first time and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and delicious doses of nudity and violence but has a appealing heavy-in-kind quality to it too; It is often as fun as it is flashy. Standout scenes include a creepy and raw vaudeville style action performed for the prisoners, as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and of course, highly repressed Superintendent McQueen (horror icon Barbara Steele, making a fantastic trip in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a bank robber scene away haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply monstrous. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that it is as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they do not take any waste from anyone, and they are more than capable of dealing with them. <br /> <br /> Our attractive throws make the most of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the sweet Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the sweet and crooked Lavelle, Gavin as the wide-eyed, and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax plays out, Demme comes up with a tense beat the clock column as our heroine race to save Belle from being lobotomized by predators Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the type of man who does not seem to use the women. <br /> <br /> Joining John Cale's tasteful scores, "Caged Heat" is optimistic entertainment and a guaranteed good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
