Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survives electrocution, the officials give him a choice to either electrocute to a greater extent or accept some attempts. He selects the experiment and is placed in a large metal cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution. They can have anything in the room (within reason), but they can't leave. after a few days the meals are cut down to one a day, and the room temp is set up to 100. After some more alarms are charged at intervals so that they cannot sleep. One day a "witch" enters their cell (albeit a glazed part). What happens now, I'll let you find out. I can be in the minority here, but I liked the construction, it was exciting for me. Now if the payout was half as good as the build, I would have rated it so much higher. <br /> <br /> My character: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster's 2 DVD sets Extra: Disc 1) Director's Cut; Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theatrical Cut; Comment with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Cast and crew interview; The preparation of; Original Trailer; and Promo Teasers
