I first saw this movie on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The movie I believe in is a complete masterpiece. It's the kind of movie that people should make. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French movie he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his lifestyle until he is crossing a Down Syndrome man living in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors, including the actor, who actually has Down's syndrome, create a credible friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and our changes change with Down's syndrome. He realizes that life not only works and does not play, but for the living and loving, and that is what life must be about. The end is kind of stupid but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to get a tear in the eye.
