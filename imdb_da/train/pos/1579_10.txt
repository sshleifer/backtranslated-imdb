I watched this movie at the Toronto Film Festival where it got a standing ovation! This film tells a story I have never told before - about Rosenstrasse (a street in Berlin) rebellion of German gentile women who were married to Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it is a unique story, and the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen shows that there were good Germans (the auxiliary family in "Anne Frank" was, for example, Dutch) who did not support the Nazis and actually had the strength to oppose their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime, at risk of their lives. The plot is good across the board, the framing history of New York interesting and intricate, the direction from Von Trotta masterful in all scenes, and the production values, including the amazing filmography, are excellent. Of course, the New York family could speak German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their mother tongue with their family - a common event. So the criticism is unjustified. To say more would ruin the experience. The movie is long, but I didn't look at my watch once. I hope this movie gets a lot of distribution is North America, because not only is this movie a masterpiece, but it can actually help to cure any animosity people face to the Germans because of their support from Hitler. If this movie plays in your area, WRITE YOU TO SEE IT! You will be glad you did!
