This is one of the best movies. It's one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work too. <br /> <br /> The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list. But they give equal or better performances than the top of the list. It's a pleasure to watch a movie about true love, romance, friendship without having to endure seeing someone having to kick their way to save the world. <br /> <br /> If you don't like this movie, you have no heart or emotion. Then go see a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. Watch the movie. It is a must. TH
