I had to give this movie a 10 simply because it did what so many movies thrown on the black audience has lost MISERABLY to do. This movie was void of all the videohore cliches, and it also skipped the gangsters, rappers and foul language. It examined several relationships between doctors, African Americans and African-American male / female romantic relationships at a whole new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the film's meticulous mix of light-headed humor with some rather hard and heavy problems. The movie will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. It was the premier of AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this movie makes it a much larger audience. Black People (and everyone else) would love a movie like this - if only the industry was SMART enough to put them out there! As an extra - if your doctor, a resident, a doctor, a premedicated student, married to a doctor, have a doctor's siblings, have a family doctor or know a good doctor's period - they would also love this movie. It portrayed the residence permit and practice in a true way of life, which was greatly appreciated by the doctors, residents and medical students who saw the film. Dennis Cooper fully spent his stay in internal medicine - so he certainly used his knowledge / experience for the film, and that is very clear.
