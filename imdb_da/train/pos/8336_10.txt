This film tells the story of a romance between Albert Einstien niece and a gas station attendant. To get the two together, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Hudsucker Proxy's Tim Robbins) learn to act more intelligently. This impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered a genius. Hilarity follows. Not to be missed. Filmed in Mercer County New Jersey at Princeton University, Lawrenceville Prep School (doubling to Princeton University) as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in Hopewell.
