David Lynch's new card is a very "Lynchian" piece full of dark, tense, silence, discreet but highly textured background music, and again has two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme in his work. <Br /> <br /> Both characters create a very exciting slave-lover relationship that can be seen as a direct follow-up to the same kind of relationship found in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. To Lynch fan's. <br /> <br />
