I saw the last half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on DVD. Recently, I've seen more of the reality series series on PBS about ranching, etc. None of them came so close to telling the story that this movie does. Based on REAL reality that draws no blows, gloomy, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a movie to be shown to students or to anyone interested in early-border life. Fine acting on the part of both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell adds to a well-executed script. The opening credit states that this was done even though funds were provided through the National Endowment for Humanities. If this is the kind of product that taxes can go to, I would be happy to see more. I highly recommend it and will encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the movie.
