I got to see this right here on Friday at the Los Angeles movie festival at Laemlee at Beverly. This movie was most applauded by all the movies that night. Considering that two music videos first opened, I didn't know what to expect as they were very quick and attentive, I wasn't sure I was ready for a card instantly. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed this. I thought the main actor's demon guy was really good. I was so impressed with his performance that I was checking his name. I was surprised to see this was the Witchblade guy. He's been really good especially since then! Either that or he got miserable roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this brief. The girl did an okay job. I think it's hard as it was her first performance and was so young. Dad did well too. There were lots of really nice work for a card, both for this and the short player next "Mexican Hat", which was also nice, but I enjoyed the most because it had the most depth and feeling, and I used to actually about characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and dark! It was about real issues using a more imaginatively similar approach to keeping ADD people like me interested. We don't even want to talk about the last movie in the block that I left. My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more of the demon character and a little less getting started, why I gave it a 9 out of 10. I also thought the final credit went a little slow. Otherwise it was beautifully told, instructed and edited. The timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast MTV editing done on everything today. More from this director comes in the future as well as the actor. I now want to think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor not the Witchblade guy.
