Recap: The morning after his bachelor party Paul is woken by his sister-in-law to be and discover that there is a woman sleeping beside him. Unfortunately, it is a waitress from the bar and not his fiancee. And suddenly she turns up everywhere ... the residence on the highway and with her parent-in-love dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-girlfriend had followed him and photographed. It's not just about saving his wedding ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: In fact, much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something much more fun, something with a small edge. This movie was not afraid to take the jokes any longer. And Jason Lee now does how he delivers comedy, especially when his character is half panic and deep in trouble as he is here. And he got good support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a great deal like ex. <br /> <br /> More emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
