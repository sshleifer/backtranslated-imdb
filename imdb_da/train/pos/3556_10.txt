Oh, it's such a wonderful musical. There is a little miscasting - Frank Sinatra is very dissatisfied with the Jewish Nathan Detroit, although it only becomes apparent on "Sue Me", which is a distinct Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with an inferior Sinatra presentation. With these two deficiencies in mind, the film is otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can't sing worthy prayers, but pulls it anyway. Stubby Kaye represents his Broadway role wonderfully (it was written to him). Damon Runyon's language and pacing and humor come through quite well. This is on my see-it-all-chance-I-get list.
