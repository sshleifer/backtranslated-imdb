First of all is the release date 2009, not 2007 for this feature length of nature documentary. It should be more correctly referred to as: "Earth, 2009". Secondly, allow me to deal with complaints from some reviewers who have seen the TV series "Planet Earth" in 2006. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this TV show but learned here that this movie is full length version of this 2006 TV series. I judge any movie, at its own merit, not from its source. I judge the results alone, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really excellent. I reject this trivial complaint from some reviewers: that it is simply an extended version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". So what? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> As a movie film and one that has seen dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime, I was astonished and greatly impressed by "Earth, 2009". This is the debut film of the new DisneyNature division in Disney and follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney's groundbreaking and Oscar-winning nature documentary from the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, movie editing, music score, sound and story are all good. There have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories. What really sets "Earth, 2009" apart is its scope. It literally covers the whole planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, it was obvious that this documentary required massive effort and time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> Three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four species on their major migrations as it spans a year through the seasons beginning in January and ending in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two special new high-tech cameras were used for this movie: a camera has a 360-degree computer-controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is an HD camera set at an amazing 1,000 frames per second. This recording technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes in "Earth, 2009", especially the cheetah hunt and big white sharks that jumped out of the water to catch hawthorns and an aerial view over the edge of the world's highest waterfall. There are many amazing great shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through filmography, music scores and narrative, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a fantastic music score performed by the world-famous Berliner Philharmonic, excellent creative and technical filmography and James Earl Jones's narrative, I consider "Earth, 2009" as the largest natural-film-length documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent, and dedication have really been very good here. This movie must be required viewing in all schools worldwide. I predict an Oscar for best documentary film, among other awards. Really a fantastic, amazing, exciting and magnificent documentary. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
