On MTV cribs, all ballers and shooters pull the classic movie Scarface out of their DVD collection. This may give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Well, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but it's not Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge seeking a new lifestyle. He falls in with the mob group and becomes a well-known lawyer. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of Brian DePalma's movie, Scarface. This belongs to my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate it *** 1/2 (out of ****). Definitely a movie to watch. Phenomenal.
