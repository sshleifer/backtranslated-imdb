A film / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they do and maybe more what they do not do. The pace is very quiet ...... so you have to relax ....... breathing ... breathe out before you see it ...... <br /> <br / > First you think .... but nothing happens and you get a little angry about it .. and that's the problem because it's the mood of the movie and the really great social realistic pictures that are good in this movie .. .... ..... many would say it's disgusting ...... but it's not that bad ... I think it's more used for marketing .... and there are some really funny moments. .. a 60 old woman stripping ..... i guarantee the most unsexy striptease in movie history ...... its movie which is real .. i think thats the word ...... right up in your face ... .... and that makes it a bit scary.no computer manipulation here ..... its real life ... and as we all know movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things ... ... .... so it's a lot worse in the real world ....... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie, can you start looking at your neighbors and think ... maybe they are the people it is he movies ... i beat many of them out there ...... sick ... crazy people living with a nice facade ........ after watching the movie, I feel more interesting to see with my neighbors ........ <br /> But maybe you should not watch this movie your first date .........
