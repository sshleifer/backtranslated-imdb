The group of people travel to Belgrade in a horrible bus led by a full conductor and his stupid son (who likes to run with his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events which, with much irony, describe the nation's fall of spirit in 1941 and are so fun that even today they are used as common jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a farmer 4 meters tall with his 4 sons who are almost twice larger than him. In the end, the film takes a dramatic trip, and the trip becomes only a swan song in a dying country.
