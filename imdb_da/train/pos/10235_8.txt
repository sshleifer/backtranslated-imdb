An unusual movie from Ringo Lam and one that is strangely appreciated. The mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears driven through bodies is remarkable especially during the first ten minutes. A horse driver gets chopped in two and his waist and legs continue to ride the horse. Several horses are chopped up. It is very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are trapped by a madman madman generally and imprisoned in the Red Lotus Temple, which seems to be more of a torture chamber than a temple. The General has a resemblance to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as he radiates oblique philosophy and makes scary paintings with human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is very impressive and the setting is gloomy. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly consistent, unlike many HK action scenes from the time. Sometimes the movie goes to absurdity, or the effects are cheesy, but it's never bad enough to destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this, it's one of the best HK kung fu movies from the early 90s. Just remember it's not child friendly.
