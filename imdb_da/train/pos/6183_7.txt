Financially strapped Paramount pulled all the stops for this '34-phase adaptation entrance: large budget, large cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen marked as director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for out-of-focus rock and a murder mystery script that doesn't deserve to be in the same garbage bin as the worst Charlie Chan's first draft down the street. I have to believe that the carving was out of Leisen's hands, as the great Duke Ellington's number has been cut, but that doesn't mean it's not worth seeing: "The Sweet Marijuana" number with topless corpses is a mind blowing considering the threatening production code, and it also has the astonishing Toby Wing (which unfortunately has fed horrible lines and plays the stupid blonde prototype) as a chorion hot for an otherwise busy Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's play is bland as Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches new plateaus as a stereotypical stupid detector. And try to see Lucy in the choir. This rates 7.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 rethink: I've recently given the movie a different look, and now I feel I was wrong to report the lack of Busby Berkeley's production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the scope of the plot. However, I still have huge problems with editing. Paramount, the most racially-owned large studio in the city, faced major problems with the production code in the worst possible time in its history, financially and pulled all stops there (see also 1934's Search for Beauty). One should look for pre-code buffs.
