IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68. It does not matter right, except that it is quite interesting to see this abstract film and video (one of the first works of art to merge the two apparently) in connection with the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released that year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feelings of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc. Are pretty convincing and pretty pretty. Certainly helped pave the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known.
