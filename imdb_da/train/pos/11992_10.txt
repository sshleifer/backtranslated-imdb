Ever since I remember, I have loved flying and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot license and looking to become a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old Tail Spin ties in my basement at home and it hit me, that was it. My parents bought every band they had and that was the only show I wanted to see as a child. I had the theme hidden as I grew up and I can still repeat it today. It's amazing and I plan to buy the DVD soon! It's really good for kids and adults and is completely timeless. I can't get enough of this show.
