I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and since I am going to study filmmaking in Canada in all places, I will definitely take it up in class. <br /> <br /> The story centered around the probably most unfortunate movie crew in the history of the movie, is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver each and every word on time. <br /> <br /> If you simply couldn't laugh at "Hollywood North" I suggest seeing a psychiatrist immediately - you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> Besides the wonderful script, I also noticed the great chemistry between the actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where they really just act? Jennifer Tilly (playing a hilarious actress) and Martin Landau also delivered a very edgy but fun performance. Great movie, even better cast.
