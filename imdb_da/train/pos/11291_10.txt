Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not real) who looked to throw his wings in the air and then shook them with his fist when he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He's only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would love to have the movie. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the movie studio that did it? <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen it in a video store like Blockbuster? I wish they would make full catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVDs these days. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where to buy a copy. Thank you.
