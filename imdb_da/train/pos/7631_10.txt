Kurt Russell's chameleon-like performance, combined with John Carpenter's flawless film creation, undoubtedly makes this one of the finest bob-tube bios ever aired. It also stops: the emotional foundation is strong enough that it never gets old; Carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy in the life of the only King of Rock and Roll. (I had been an Elvis fan for most of my life, but it was not until I saw this thought-provoking movie I was looking at the image of the man himself. It was a revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the ten best movies always.
