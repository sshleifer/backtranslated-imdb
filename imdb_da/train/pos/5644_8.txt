When the United States entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to cast out propaganda films. The little American is probably the best of the party because the stars Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is delayed because of the war when both men call. <br /> <br /> When the ship Pickford sails, the Germans (think Lusitania) are lowered because they carry ammunition, Pickford has a fantastic scene that she stands on lifeboat and shouts at the German commander. Later, of course, she goes into both Holt and Hatton when she is held as a prisoner of war on a castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille provides a truly stunning scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt wander through a bombed out village. They pass a ruined church where only one wall remains. Against the wall is a very large crucifix. As they stand and look at, the wall collapses, but the Jesus figure remains suspended in the middle of the air. It's a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy. <br /> <br /> Pickford is always a pleasure to see. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the many other actors of the arm-waving histrionics from the day that was spent. She is also very very beautiful. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is okay. The list of name players in "extra" parts is Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie but interesting to watch American propaganda at work.
