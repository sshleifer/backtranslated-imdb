The adherent to this movie did not do the film's justice. And while the movie didn't know what it would really be like, the first half of the movie was a light romance comedy, and the other one had a more serious, romantic drama, the overall effect was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it more of a thrill thriller that it never really turned out to be. Of course, Kidman, as one of my favorites, is biased, but this movie turned out to be a light, sensitive, somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 9.5.02.
