This should be one of the best movies to come out of HK for a long time, I waited eagerly to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title. Lots of amazing actors in this show and I was especially impressed by Sam Lee's impossible credible insane behavior and Edison's depiction of a killer machine that completely turned its normal idol image. I would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action-packed movie. But I have to warn you, it's also an equally depressing movie, as all the characters in the movie are in a kind of dead end and trouble with their own and struggling to breathe. Do you think about what really is about life.
