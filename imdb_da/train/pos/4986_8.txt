Lensman is a little less known Anime gem from Toho and MK studios. It is loosely based on the novel, but it reminds me of more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> To see this, see it in Japanese with subtitles or simply Japanese. The English dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to death. There is not much new, despite the fact that it is the first animated feature to combine CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to see, anyway.
