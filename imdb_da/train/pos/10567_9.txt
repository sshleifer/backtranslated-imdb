A strange one. One of the best musicals ever. The three Busby Berkely tracks ending in the movie are spectacular, but what makes this movie so wonderful is the incredible non-stop teats and the natural appearance of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also lovely, although she may not have been a great actress). There is freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today, much less in the normally styled 30s movie, although the plot involving the movie prologue setup is quite dated.
