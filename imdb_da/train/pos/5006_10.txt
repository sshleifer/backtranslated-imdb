I remember stumbling upon this special while channel surfing in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought, "This is probably the best on TV I will ever see in my life." 42 years later it has been true. There is still nothing so amazing, as frankly amazing as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the superstars you want, it's the most superior of them all! <br /> <br /> You are what she can do. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is really a story-teller. Her ability to pull everything she tries is legendary. But this particular was made in the beginning and helped create the legend that she quickly became. In spite of the fact that she has so far risen for such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise and revealed several of her talents as she walked together. But they are here right from the beginning. You won't be disappointed to see this.
