It is not always easy to explain what a movie is, but this time I think I've found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (criminals who score some drugs and do some stupid things in Scotland) and The Blair Witch Project (due to the movie's style). It's about loyalty between two friends, one of them comes out of jail, the other has not been caught yet. With a stolen vehicle, they drive through the Scottish countryside, but do not get out of gasoline. As they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of the sky. The farmer believes they will steal him and point to a gun at one of them. But everything goes wrong. One of the friends shoots accidents the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a man hunting through the fields and forest of Scotland. The two friends will literally run for their lives. This movie was apparently shot in just 12 days. OK, it's not exactly incredible, because most of it is always in the same place: the Scottish landscape, but I still find it amazing. Especially because this is not a bad movie. It may not be the greatest movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they have achieved. I had a good time watching it and generally enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.
