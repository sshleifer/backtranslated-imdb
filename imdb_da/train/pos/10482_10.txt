I love this movie. It's one of those I can see over and over again. It is well traded by a good casting that does not try too hard to be starred. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for a newly established housewife who turns to sell the pot to make ends meet, could have been made into an Americanized turd by a movie or action thriller. Either would have killed the movie completely. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like an Ealing Comedy with an amazing emotional factor throughout. It's worth seeing just for the stage with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (no it's not a spoiler!)
