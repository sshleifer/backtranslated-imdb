This movie is one of the best time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is excellent, the music is as good as the movie, and the killer is as creepy as it can be! Actors are amazing, RIP Donald Pleasance you were amazing as Dr. Loomis, he made the movie even better. Without him, the film would lack a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends roughly murdered in the house, which is, of course, one of the best scenes in the movie. She gives a great performance. I loved this movie as it scared me back as hell when I saw it in the early 80s, and I still see it today, as it is a great movie that just brings you into this world where you could be beaten like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a crazy man in a mask escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without having any idea that he is there is just shockingly scary and Enjoy yourself even more in movies as the events even though fiction could easily come true. We all know that, unfortunately, evil exists in this world, and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing deep fear of all this. Death at any turn. Halloween, of course, shows this in the most frightening way. Horror must be credible and that is what makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that's made for an excellent and scary atmosphere. In addition to Psycho's excellent history, which I both love, I think there are the best horror that has to offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I want to see them all my life and never get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies all the time.
