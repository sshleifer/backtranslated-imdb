Hrm-I think the line was from the old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie that apparently has been translated from any language completely unknown to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so incredible that they have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that instead of fighting wars, nations have climbed guys into giant robots and shouted it out to determine it, it is never terribly clear. But that's probably something really important. There are good guys (of course, capitalists, that is, "us") and bad guys (Commies!), And there are great stop-motion robots. Unfortunately, the effect budget was pretty slim, so we don 't see many of the big robots. There are lots of cheap looking interiors, and then a large room fights near the end. The space fight is especially nice, as it serves just no other purpose than to blow the rest of the power budget. <br /> <br /> With the money now spent, the fight is declining (and I don't make this up) two guys hit each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in a bar by recreating the final scene, complete with a final line that guarantees that no audience cuts their heads. As I said - it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
