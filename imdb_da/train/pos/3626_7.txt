This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher / baseball coach inspired by his players to try out the pros and fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the big ones. Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sports film, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the parts work, and the producers are doing a credible job of recreating the real events that led to Morris's short stint as a jugger for the magnificent Tampa Bay Devil Rays . The first half of the film dealing with his rag tag pile of High School Baseball players (all of which are all too old to be in High School) is less effective and probably a little too long. Overall, the movie suffers from some pacing problems and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without. However, it is still a fairly involved film with an inspiring theme, which again shows that baseball is the national pastime of a reason. GRADE: B-
