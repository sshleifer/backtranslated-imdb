I suck on gratuitous Boob references, so I'll just write a clear flat (no pun intended) review. I love Elvira, not in a "I'm about to shoot-press-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatic", but enough to say I think she's rocking. The movie is played as a 50's horror movie only much more fun, look for "Deciduous ankle ride" to know what I mean. Which relay shines through in the movie is the absolute charm of Elvira's (or should it be cassandras). I first saw this movie at the age of 8 and have seen the incredible times since. I really have to get around to buying a copy, and the video store version looks a bit worse for wear. If any other fans of the movie will send me an email about it, it's free. <br /> <br /> Another great achievement by Edie McClurg (chastedy pariah), an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
