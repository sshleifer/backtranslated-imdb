For years, I thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the leaders. It certainly has the same tough house humor that Ford twists his films with. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I learned that it was George Stevens who actually directed it. I still refuse to believe that this movie was not offered to John Ford, but he was probably out in Monument Valley to make Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen, along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., plays three sergeants in the Indian Army who have a lovely friend / friend / friendship. But the old gang breaks up because Fairbanks is engaged to marry Joan Fontaine. Not if his two friends can help it, helped and anchored by regimental beastie Gunga Din as played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> The Rudyard Kipling poem served as the inspiration for this RKO movie about the barracks lives of British Raj. The magnificent playing of the leaders is so good that it overshadows the movie's incredibly racist message. Not that the creators were racist, but that was the British assumption at that time, including our leads, and Gunga Din showing this most effectively. <br /> <br /> The British trains India with steps, made deals here and there with local rulers during a weak Mogul emperor, who finished in the mid-19th century. They ruled very little India indirectly, it would have been impossible. Your rule depends on the built-in troops you see here. Note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal, and Gunga Din is significantly lower in status than that. <br /> <br /> Note here that the rebels are actually Hindu, not Muslim. There are so many tribes of this religion as there are Christian sects, and this strict cult was quite genuine. Of course, those who are strangled cannot view them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement until the congress party became, these people were the mood of a free India. <br /> <br /> But you cut it, but it's not a good thing to stifle people. and the British also had their points here. When I look at Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason for the primary directive came into being. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant got to play his real cockney himself here instead of the urban Cary we're used to seeing. Fairbanks and McLaglen are doing very well with roles that are perfectly suited to their personalities. <br /> <br /> However, the best-performing role in the movie is Eduard Ciannelli as the guru, the leader of the Strangler cult. Notice the fire and the passion of his performance, he blows everyone else off the screen when he is on. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli admonishing their troops in their mountain temple. Note how Stevens gradually darkens the background around Ciannelli until all you see is eyes and teeth like a ghoulish Halloween mask. Haunting, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was just after the action of this film at the end of the nineteenth century that more and more of the British public began to question the underlying assumptions that justified Raj. But that's Gandhi's subject. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a good movie, entertaining and fun. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can see how the Indian Independence Movement evolved.
