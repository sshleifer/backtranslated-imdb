Bottom line - Best romantic comedy ever. This film performs what every major movie strives for: the creation of a world and time that we want to visit again and make us happy to be part of humanity. When I'm blue, this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh (and it's still true for many pictures - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All the players are in top form. The characters are so dead and the characters fit so well together that you forget the actor (usually hard to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The support molding is consistently brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a total pygmy package"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as "Greek choir" - "but the time does not exist"), Durning "something we can start from NJ "), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins boss and co-worker at the gas station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies does Eisenhower ??). <br /> <br /> Don't miss this overlooked treasure.
