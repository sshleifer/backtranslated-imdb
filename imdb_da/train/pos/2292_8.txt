Just looked at this early Bugs Bunny (the first time he is called here) and Elmer Fudd's cartoon on ThadBlog as the link from YouTube. This was Chuck Jones the first time instructing "wascally wabbit" and as a result, Bugs has another voice from Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx, which we are more familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he channels Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" -type personality at that time). In any case, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs all go uncomfortable with him by turning the radio really loudly and letting himself die after his master throws him out of his shower repeatedly and says "Turn off the lights!" when Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with the different voice, Bugs is certainly his evil self and I laughed myself blue all the time! According to Thad, there was an extra scene at the end of Elmer, who just gave the house to Bugs after hell, he went through, but it was probably considered sad as he suffered a mental breakdown at the time so it is just as Well, cutting the scene is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
