John Waters most accessible movie so far is one of his better ones, considering he is cutting back on all campiness and utter vulgarity that seems to chill most of his previous work. Certainly, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a way that cannot be considered wrong or disgusting. Because of some great casting choices, this movie has really brought out the silliness of contemporary art and the subjective nature of your contemporary artist. Fun and a little merciless (if possible for Waters), this is one of those movies I would see on a rainy day.
