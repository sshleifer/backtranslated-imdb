Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this movie was about, those names were enough to attract me. Beautiful, talented and popular, it's the artists to watch out for. <br /> <br /> Okay, where do I start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls are targeted by a "romantic" serial slasher, a guy they all knocked on school dance 13 years ago. His trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolate, and a bleeding nose. His optional weapon: Well, take a pick ax, knife, electric power drill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Okay, so basically it's a scary movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror films should not be Shakespeare, but I will not get there. I love horror movies but not all of them. The one I love It is up there with some of my other favorites. It's fun, sexy and scary. The murder mask is childishly scary, and seeing that cupid firing a bow and arrow on a victim is really freaky. The story is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very funny. I really wanted to see much, much more of Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her do some leading work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very talented actress and Jessica Cauffiel gets to make the ditzy blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com'), and the younger version of Denise Richards was as horrible as her. Highlights: Each scene of death had a special distinction to it. The craziest is the opening scene in the morning house. The hottub scene, while ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was scary. The soundtrack is great, with crazy music and some nice alternative tunes. Lowpoint: I felt that the killer was not enough, we hardly saw the mask, and it was not at all embossed. under climax. I also thought the climax was really unfocused, but fun. <br /> <br /> The button at the end was not a big surprise, but I'm really happy that the filmmakers decided to save us all <br /> <br /> I don't like telling people what movies they should Look, but if anyone asked me to choose a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing, Valentine would be. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
