Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without a British accent, he is more than that with his over-the-top and greater than lifetime interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. As Scott stands in front of a large window, sunlight throws a glowing cloak over him; All you can see is his silhouette. Increased by Scott's voice, a weird grumble, the effect is galvanizing ... like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Horror", yes! <br /> <br /> But, as they say, the lot that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott shows such merry ferocity throughout the movie, it shows contagious. To put it another way, "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as "after" even though he really shouldn't be. That's what you might call the "Doctor Smith" effect as Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing the role and many other weights (both the stage and the screen). <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not consider myself Scott's slip of responsibility. But other "Christmas Carol" tourists can. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
