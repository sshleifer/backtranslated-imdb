I gave this movie 8 out of 10 as I booked 10 for example Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire at the latest. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge such films without understanding the life of the Balkans, mentality and a soul that Kusturica presents masterfully. To understand it, you really have to be one of the Balkans. This is a great movie, much better and more modern of his previous movie, which is boring at this time, I think Kusturica is continuing with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art itself, every scene is artistic to the limit. Plot is probably an adventure, remember it now, but remember to read to my daughter who goes - to sleep a similar story.
