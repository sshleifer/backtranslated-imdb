Maybe I'm too generous with the review ... but I just love this movie! I've seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love with it all over again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing great or monumental happening. But I'm a big romantic and this movie * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so much fun. The scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's such a clean, good movie - and they're so rare now! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie too, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you have to laugh, or if you are just lonely and should * see * a romance if you cannot participate in one. It's a good one!
