The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are on it again. With "Fever Pitch", the creators of other films that have dealt with many brutal themes have abandoned that tactic as they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film to the screen, something that would have been hard to do. The novel, with the same title, treated a man's occupation with football, as it is set in England, where the sport consumes most British sports fans. It is credit to the writing team Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most Americans when they make their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a film that presents an obsessive fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life turns into the Red Sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher with scary ways to involve his students on in the subject he is trying to teach them. When Ben takes four of his best students for a trip to a local company, he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the cunning Lindsey Meeks, a young woman going places, but in thirty have no independent life. br /> <br /> History follows the two lovers through the ritual of joining the Red Sox, home team, in Fenway Park. This team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world who are stuck with a team that does amazing things, but until 2004 they never won a World Series. In fact, the end, from what we heard, had to be changed because it was the year when they finally won the event that had removed them for 80 years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as paired in the middle of the movie. Mrs. Barrymore is a natural, always surprising in her appearance in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular television comedian, became a film actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in "Taxi", in our humble opinion. The Farrelly Brothers movie will also satisfy their fans as baseball fans with this baseball tale.
