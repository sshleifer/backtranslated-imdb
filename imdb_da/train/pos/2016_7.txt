Higher and Higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's smaller Broadway musicals, it only had a round of 84 performances on Broadway in 1940. But it gave one of their bigger hits. It never came into my mind. <br /> <br /> However, apart from a minor song, so eerily rich, the entire Broadway score was scrapped when RKO bought the movie rights. Instead, a whole new score was written by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson, mostly to accommodate a Francis Albert Sinatra who made his feature film debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who had made some vocal cameos in previous films, takes a leaf from the side of his singing competitor Bing Crosby. When Bing played his feature debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took the role of Frank Sinatra, and I can't think of anyone who could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The board chairman is billed third here behind stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is the butler, and she is the girl's girlfriend to Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months. Mainly because he is about to go in the stomach in chapter 11 or he informs the staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a lovely old soul to work for and none of the employees will lose a good thing. They collect their resources and get Michele Morgan to imitate Erril's daughter, who is over in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to sneak a rich bankroll in the hope of saving the family's wealth. Only Michele starts looking at another. It is a small plot and certainly not worse than a lot of musicals, but RKO invested this movie with a good draft of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another débutante and her mother who suspects something is not right, Victor Borge is a fortune that does not seek anything. Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes play others in the Errol household staff. Not a bad bunch at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra singing three good ballads all had some sort of commercial success, The Music Stopped, a great way to spend an evening, and I couldn't sleep a snap Igåraftes. The last one was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, but lost to Alice Fayes, you will never know. 1943 was the year of the music Union Strike against the admission industry. To get their material out, Frank Sinatra recorded the songs of Higher and Higher with an acapella choir for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded songs from his movie Dixie in the same way for Decca. Both were condemned by Union President James C. Petrillo as strike breakers and both did not cross the picket line again. The strike did not run until 1944, although Decca broke earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than Columbia, RCA Victor and the others. The stacking gave some exciting moments to Sinatra. He had just left Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called. It closed a necessary place for his artistic work when he wasn't sure whether to leave Dorsey would prove to be a real career move. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, higher and higher were received and a legend was launched.
