Having become completely dependent on Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding !! I absolutely love this show and can't turn it off. The character of the characters, the complicated plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing. I am completely and completely connected. I don't know how the creators do it, but every character touches me very deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core !!! I do not have a cable, so I have rented the series on Netflix. When I put it on, I see all the episodes at once and feel sad when it's over. I can't wait for the next disc to come to my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
