I accidentally came to this movie when I noted all the movies I wanted my sister to record for me while on vacation, and I'm so glad I included this one. It's about issues that most directors are away from, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for TV so I couldn't buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's a touching story about how people with eating disorders aren't necessarily shy away from everyone, and how many actually have diet mates. It was emphasized that although bulimics may maintain a relatively stable weight, they have more serious consequences for their health, as many people are unaware of.
