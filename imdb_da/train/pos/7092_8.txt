There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of twelve monkeys. Gilliam (supposedly) produced a long list (think of the plane one from the fifth element) and handed it to the butch bruce. It had the title "Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts". It ended with a simple message saying, "Don't do any of the above in my movie." <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this movie (absolute sand). Gilliam did not have a hand in writing. I would argue that these two factors played a major role in creating the extraordinary success (if not commercial) which is the twelve monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are just what we rightly expected from a Gilliam movie. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam is looking forward to the wrong audience. Although the end of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has gone through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clock, bureaucratic, relentless movement of the signs against their destiny. It is this journey, and the character development they undergo, disturbing. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam movies (especially Brazil). But they all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his film almost always ends up as a mess (especially Brazil). I still claim that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there is no denial that The Twelve Monkey is a fresh breath in the tight plot. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way that is not usually seen from ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumors above, Gilliam also manages to get a first-rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald. Bruce is excellent in this movie, like all the cast, especially an appropriate bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It has been over a decade since this movie was released. When I saw it again, I realized that it was not really aged. Of course I was changed. And it made me look at the movie with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a movie that is at least about reflections in mirrors, changing perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time, which we all do. A premium movie. 8.10.
