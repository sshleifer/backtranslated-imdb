I don't easily distribute ten star ratings. A movie must really impress me and the Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Moreover, this trilogy has been collected so nicely that I think it is one of the greatest movie trilogies of our time. Although all three films could not be more different from the Ludlum short stories, they still stand as a strong milestone in cinematic performance. The Bourne Ultimatum made me cry that the series was finished, but I couldn't even try to stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew we were in favor of a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne movies is here again: the action, the dialogue and of course the shaking camera. But for me the latter was never a problem. I think it adds excitement. <br /> <br /> I'll be back to watch this movie several times before being released on DVD, simply because it's genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should be the time test as a fantastic movie and, in general, an unforgettable trilogy.
