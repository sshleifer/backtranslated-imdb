I started watching this movie expecting nothing, just another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes is art and main character, which is enigmatic, not much, I really got myself in this movie. <br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully acted and really touching. It's a bit slow, but immersion was complete. The management was great at letting us know the bits for the bit story that led to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes. The end was unexpected with a twist, I didn't look forward. It's not the kind of movie we often see.
