An oddly enjoyable effort that combines a suitably colored album with Adam and Burt and flashbacks for the original TV series. Most flashback scenes were lifted directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie. Like the book, it left fans from the original series who hungered for more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth trying to borrow a bond from a friend who might have recorded it. I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
