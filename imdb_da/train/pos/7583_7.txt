The last chapter of the Hanzo Razor trilogy provides appropriate closure for this entertaining series of samurai exploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps because of Shintaro Katsu, who serves as a producer, except for the titular antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo reveals a female ghost guarding treasure hidden at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo is Hanzo, he is not discouraged by the fact that she is a ghost, so he continues with rape ... ahem, interrogate her, using the well-known revolving netting unit. The plot goes through a number of blind monks, also doubletime as loanharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's senior officers Onishi and his two servants provide the typical comic notes, and generally it is business as usual. <p> <p> Significantly less coherent and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the other (undoubtedly the finest in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthy of its own benefits. Complete with brand training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fighting and a mystery Hanzo are encouraged to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.
