Deathtrap is not a whodunit. It is someone who will make it to whom first. It is so difficult to describe this movie without giving anything away, so I will not mention anything more about the plot. As far as acting is concerned, it is Cris Reeves greatest role as Clifford, a young playwrite. You really see the series in his acting in this movie from "exhaling cheeseburgers" to scary even. Clifford is such a tough role to play, and in the stage production of this I have never seen the Clifford game well on both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him like a little puppy or a homicidal maniac. Reeves is the only person I have seen that has the character completely. As for Michael Caine, he's ..... yes, he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors in the last 50 years and in this movie as good as he has ever been.
