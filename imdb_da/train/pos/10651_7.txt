Some movies simply should not be restored. This is one of them. In itself, it's not a bad movie. But it fails to capture the taste and terror of 1963 movie with the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the throwing ends with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just didn't get the right sense of Luke's character. But the big mistake in this version is that it went too far from the Shirley Jackson story as it tries to be grandiose and lost some of the excitement of the previous movie in a trade for more special effects. Again, I would say that it is not a bad movie in itself. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
