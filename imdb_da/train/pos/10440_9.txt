This movie is intelligent. It is more than most other movies, it exceeds the smallest common denominator - stupid people will not appreciate it. The story is also dependent on dialogue. It has some parallels with lost in translation, although before sunrise is much lighter, somehow less abstract and simply much better. The script, the signs and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel completely realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the play have merged it perfectly. <br /> <br /> The dialogue addresses very personal issues with the risk of being a little over the top. However, it remains on the right side almost all the time, although I did find a little unpleasant and embarrassing moment. Balancing on this fine line requires demanding talented actors. Sometimes it gives good results, and in general, this movie is simply overwhelming! Only very, very rarely is "love" in movies depicted in a way that I find credible and realistic. Every time it is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think that the amazing and seemingly timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this regard. She still looks great in this movie, 12 years after. <br /> <br /> This is simply a gem of a movie you can't miss. One of the best movies I've seen from the 1990s!
