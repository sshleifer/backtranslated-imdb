I just thought it was excellent and I still do. I'm grateful we can still see different things from what Hollywood almost flood us with. Saving Grace is smart and fun - those who feel offended by marijuana stuff, better see American bride's kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid. I laughed my ass out of most of it, but also considered questions about what the female protagonist should do to pay off her late husband's debt. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - a witty story with typical English humor and good acting and management. You couldn't ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
