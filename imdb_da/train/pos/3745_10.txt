Many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder most mistakes, collection of tracks, gaggle of possible perps, red herring spell and inevitable showdown between clever evil and even more clever crime solution. "Forgotten" leaves faith and gives us complex signs that may or may not have committed horrible actions. The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly bound packages can frustrate some, but to me it was a sign of an intelligently crafted narrative that probes, disturbs and tracks the question: What does one do the evil person looks like? <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easy ... forgotten.
