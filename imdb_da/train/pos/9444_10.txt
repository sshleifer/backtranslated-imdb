*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packed with memorable moments (as quoted above, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four boys taking a trip to the wild forests to go rafting and get away from the big city for a while to find out that their fun soon goes bad. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are virtually no special effects, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing is at all sugar-coated or done beautifully. The city's boys resemble the city's boys, and even the fierce guy Louis, depicted with precision by Burt Reynolds, is evident in the grace of the wild on this journey. This is a perfect example of a what-if movie. What if a few friends were rafting in a wooded area that none of them were aware of and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted of murder that they were forced to commit to their rescue own life? <Br /> <br /> There is obviously a very strong element in the film dealing with the social and class structure and relationship (or lack thereof) of rural and urban populations. When the four guys arrive in the forest early in the movie, they clearly do not know how to interact with the people living out there and they talk to them as if they are not sure whether they will understand or be capable of to communicate. This communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, where they attempt to gass the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles down for them. While Drew and of course the inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis has some trouble buying the gas, and Bobby comments on genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it is. The whole thing is. When the boy turns away from Drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their horrible jam session, he tells him to give the child a few bucks, knowing that none of them is absolutely sure how to respond. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of things we see in the Release that creates so much of the excitement to be followed. This great scene where there was a lot of fun (including the funniest "redneck dancing" scene until O Brother, Where Art Thou?) Ended with everyone, unfortunately unsure of what to do about each other. These people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed meet in the hills, grew up in modern society and modern laws and live by nature's rules, which do not include not killing. Confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river and hoped for the strange end to end and for the adventure began. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When the cards are separated from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the hills next to the river, which quickly become unpleasant and the uncertainty about how these people live - which was established by The scene above - comes into play to create the most tension under the stage. I think a good sign of a quality player like this is that the movie's tragic element, namely assault and actual murder, takes a very small screen time, but remains some of the most memorable parts of the movie. There is no free violence here, it is all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a starting strong effect. The move is about the violent clash between two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they accidentally find war with each other. The ride down the rest of the river after the assault, which takes the majority of the film out, gives a spectacularly effective excitement and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you so much that you get numb. It's surprisingly effective when we find out that Ed may well have killed the wrong man up there on the rock, and the excitement of the movie doesn't even give up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing movie that is a testament to its success because it is quite obvious that a movie like this is meant to shake people up a little. Hillbillies is the human (ie more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but rather similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, which can neither be compared to a timeless movie like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so right, and we know the men as well and in such a subtle way that it almost as if we as individuals of the audience are really a fifth member of the team . It's not often that a movie is able to get that way.
