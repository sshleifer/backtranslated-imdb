The wooden horse is a very smart movie about a very smart and successful flight plan prepared by British POWs during World War II. It is excellently acted upon with an angry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is tight and rapid movement throughout. Highly recommended.
