Really, I think this movie is more of an easy target than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is really well done in many respects and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit outdated, but it's the genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Like all the old noir classics, this also has a manuscript that turns you around so you don't always know how to understand it first and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all the pieces together. It's the genre. Generally, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and in turn surprised without leaving the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is, she looks good, and she speaks her double-entangled dialogue in such a way that it becomes something mysterious, sexy and fun. The direction is more than acceptable because we face it - you need to keep an audience interested in "did she or did she not?" questions for two hours. In addition to a twisted script and a fun performance of Stone, this is effectively done by the direction of the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very sharp and modern while at the same time straight industrial products joining Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press break anywhere, and there is something interesting to the eye. <br /> <br /> The film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first movie and makes them something more real, especially the meat. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" is treated more materially in reality here, and typically the sexuality of the film is used for better effect. It's still titillating, but not made so easy for shock value and buzz as done in the first. I don't want to say that it's not yet a gimmick, let's see, this movie has to be fun. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie. It may be an easy target, but if you see it for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatal drive, twisty, sexy, she or she didn't do what you have to enjoy (no saying is calculated).
