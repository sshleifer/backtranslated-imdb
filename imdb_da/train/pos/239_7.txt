I watched this movie with my boyfriend at the time, and I can say I didn't have the best time, mainly because I didn't know about Ned Kelly or his story. But since this is a biopic, it is important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the way events are told is true or if it's all fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is exhibited as a hero and a struggle for justice, makes me believe everything is true. I don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid western type movie for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is amazing as always, and the sexy Naomi Watts charms the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance if it flies on cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.
