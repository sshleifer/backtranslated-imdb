A question of life and death, what can you really say it would properly do right to genius and beauty in this movie. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no boundaries, each frame is filled with amazingly bold compositions. The shifts between the bold colors of "the real world" to the heavenly black and white are brilliant and visually show us how much more living life is. The final court scene is also great, as the judge and the jury go down the stairs to heaven to judge Peter (David Niven) 's operation. <br /> <br /> All the shows are spot on (Roger Livesey is a standout) and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, which has never been a more romantic movie than this (if I have it "I've seen it ). A question of life and death is about the power of love and just how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's film is reason enough to watch the movie alone, the way he lights up Kim Hunter's face makes her more beautiful, which genius he can make simple things like a game of table tennis looks exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; The way the sound is attenuated at vital points was a decision far ahead of its time <br /> <br /> This is a true classic that can restore everyone's beliefs in the cinema, appreciated during its first release and by today's audience. but one of my favorites all the time, which is why I give this movie a 10/10, in a word - beautiful.
