This is a really well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favorite movie of her. This film should have won the National Award and would have been my choice to represent India on the Oscars. It's at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws' coming to Oscars from India this year. It is such a shame that the information on this (and all other Indian movies) on the IMDb is missing and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the throw and the crew are not mentioned at all. Prizes and nominations for this film are not given, although Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not even a vote for 'Doghi'. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It's Marathi, and luckily escaping the song and the order of dance, is not intertwined in glittering glamor and half-witted designer ware. It is a really lively story that is made with a rare understanding and respect. 'Doghi', which can be roughly translated as 'two women', is a story of two sisters Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave venture not into many sub-areas, making it a very difficult movie to lead. The entire movie is set in a remote remote village in Maharashtra, and the screen rarely goes far from the two female protagonists' house. No aesthetic sunsets in this. <br /> <br /> The movie opens and we are introduced to the whole house, which prepares the Gauri wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father is a hard-working farmer, the house is full and happy; There is nothing that wants in their simple life. But on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's spouse meets a fatal accident. Gauri's father cannot carry the tragic news and suffers from a huge stroke. Without a strong, functioning member, the house could have fallen apart, but Gair's mother pushes the responsibility. She works when she can, but can't make ends meet. But her life is still easier than Gauri. Exceeding that people are half-heartedly trying to forget, Gauri makes a vicious hero. She is excluded from society. <br /> <br /> Gaur's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help, she accepts her proposal. He takes Gauri out to Mumbai, where she is made to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns and their relationship improves. Gauri gives his life for his family. <br /> <br /> But when Gauri returns to Krishna's wedding, her mother doesn't come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri, but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She asks her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promise that they would face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes out to Mumbai, but what she does is never said ?? The subtle dialogues tell us what is known. It's just the only story that is deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is a responsible movie theater. It is respect for the subject it handles. It's respect for its audience ?? It does not think they have the mental ability of a four year old. <br /> <br /> The play is first rate. The direction is wonderful ?? The silences carry the story forward in a way that no words could have. Scripture is well-researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to 'Doghi'.
