The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film critic, nor do I want to act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie. Of course, this movie did not 'I have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the play was amazing and the film was amazing! It looked like everyone had a lot of fun making this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I imagine it might have been a mistake in recording the DVD. I will definitely check out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
