This movie was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart for Best Actor. I can't see why Lucile Watson was nominated for best support actor, I just don't think she did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and enter the United States in the film's first scene. They go by train to Davis' relatives house. Davis and Lukas were in the subway to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and in need of rest. But when they come home, they are a Nazi who lives there, and theirs is not much, nor can they happen. It turns out that the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to enter into an agreement with Luke. Yours is more to the plot, but you can find out for yourself.
