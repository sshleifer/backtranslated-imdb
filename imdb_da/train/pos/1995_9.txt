I've just seen this recently, after an interval of nearly forty years. It does well, especially Lionel Bart's excellent songs. ("Who will buy" with the magic counterpoint, just one of many standouts.) <br /> <br /> I disagree with the second post that rejected its G rating. The rating system, which was completely new at that time, never intended the G (General) value to mean "completely without conflict". <br /> <br /> Characterizing what unfit for kids reminds me of the description I once saw The Wizard of Oz: A girl comes in a foreign country and kills the first person she meets. She then goes on a road trip with three companions and kills again.
