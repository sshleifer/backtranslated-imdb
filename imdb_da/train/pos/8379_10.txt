I remember this movie from when I was 12, it was amazing .. I remember the day not as most things I saw back then I have even tried to buy it, but it's like rocking horse sh * t! Still, the play is a bit cool, but the story is great, as it was a real B-movie with a low budget and the incident where the battle scenes were amazing to see, I must have seen it about 20 times. It was a very well-filmed movie, and I loved the idea of ​​fighting with giant man-guided robots, pity that they would destroy it by making a crappy spin off "Crash and Burn", don't watch the movie that way, it's total pants! If you are a true Sci-Fi movie fan, look here if it was restored today, it would be a winner .. I would really love to see a remake or even release the DVD of it.
