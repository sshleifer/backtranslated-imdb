I'm not a big Tim Matheson fan, but I have to admit I liked this movie. It was dark and a little disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy, I don't know that classifying this movie is a little SF and a bit scary slash thriller.I saw this at about 2.00 or so on my local channel there was nothing else on, so I decided to see it.If you haven't seen this movie id recommend it not so bad, the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this movie even better. I do not know if this movie went to the cinema, but it felt like it was made for TV or went directly to video, because I wanted to buy this if it is on DVD it fits well with my type of movie and has a little bit of the X-FILES story linked to it. Management firms or sharp companies involved in risky, shady conditions. All in all, a good movie.
