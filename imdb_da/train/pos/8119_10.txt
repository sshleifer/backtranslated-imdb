I think the opening of 20 minutes of this movie is perhaps one of the most exciting recorded, with the amazing music score working to create excitement for a smashing climax. What cinema goers made of this in the 30s, I can only imagine. "The times" said at that time, "A miracle has come to the screen." See it and wonder.
