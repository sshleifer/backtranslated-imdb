Several years ago, when I first looked at "Gray Gardens", I remember laughing and finding the fun camp. Years later, I still laugh loudly when I see it, but after many performances I have come to see the beauty of the strange, winding relationship between the inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. <br /> <br /> Mother and daughter living together in their dilapidated 28-room East Hampton mansion adds a whole new meaning to the phrase "Shabby Chic". With countless cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niches of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles in their mansion to film those living lives day to day. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving statement of true love and anarchy. The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. And their lives are an example of drive, determination and free will. This movie has more to recommend than I can put into words. It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself. <br /> <br />
