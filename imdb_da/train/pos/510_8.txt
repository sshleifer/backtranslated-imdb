I just watched this for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten both how imaginative the pictures were and how witty the movie is. I had not forgotten the opening scenes that are (with the scene at the Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed. Anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's off-hand references - Anyone interested in romance will be moved by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual images will enjoy the notion of the afterlife. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" nearby - but this one is great. <br /> <br />
