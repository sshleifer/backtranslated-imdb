I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has been sticking with me over the years. It's not about soundtrack or filmography or even the dialogue and some bad acting. It's about the educational purpose, and the message behind it is the most important. It is not a sin to have a child when you are a teenager and still in high school, nor is it a bad thing, but it is a problem. Ton's girls I knew have all the kids now and I assume they never saw this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you are in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but they must take a back seat in your future because you have a child to think about first. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message behind it: JUST SAY NO!
