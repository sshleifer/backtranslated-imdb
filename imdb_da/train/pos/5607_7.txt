When I saw The Tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses many of the genre's troops: the creepy occasion, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. The hero's life, Trelkovsky, seemed surrounded by evil, secret forces trying to drive him up. <br /> <br /> The last time I looked at it, I challenged this initial interpretation. If this movie is a horror movie, only horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror. In fact, this movie can be understood at a literal level as a lonely man slowly becomes crazy without any external influence. In his career, Polanski made three films dealing with madness: Repulsion, which I do not specifically like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, where the hero is driven by evil forces; and the tenant, who may be the best study of paranoia ever made in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man renting an apartment where a woman killed herself. He becomes obsessed with her and begins to slowly become her: he wears the clothes, puts on makeup and speaks like her. But is he obsessed with a spirit, or does he just let his wild imagination get the best of him? It is this hesitation between what is genuine and imaginary, and as Polanski never resolves, it makes it such a fascinating film. Many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be for normal reasons, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe in. <br /> <br /> Though this is not my favorite Polanski movie, it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create excitement and portray madness in very convincing terms. And technically, it is also a marvel. Suffice to say he collaborates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary director of photography Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP) in the film. A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments can make this movie hard to enjoy, but it is still an experience.
