I enjoyed this movie yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and have many friends in the music industry ... who are now trying to become adults .... no more fans, groupies, money etc ... and they have a hard time adjusting to an ordinary life ... like they see the new bands etc. getting spotlights ... it's almost like they have to start again ... this film is a testament to what many of the old rockers from the 70s and 80s are going through now. ... and this is where I find the movie sad and depressing.But it depicts the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost in a credible way. The young girl who comes to her upscale home reminds me of the Hollis maclaren (scandalous) ... and she is a lady in a movie you want to cheer for. This movie is a must for people in their 50s who have seen the rise and fall of bands, people who knew the members, and have seen them hurt as the age creeps in and the popularity fades. This is an almost perfect movie ... but somehow positive .... because of the whales. One must see!
