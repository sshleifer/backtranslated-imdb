Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and attempted to kill her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and use her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and the title then in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is a nasty movie to watch. It presents a scenario that is all too right for us in America: The witch is chasing a person who is considered an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being a person who spoke her thoughts, a person who did not play the sympathy card, and one who was just hard enough to move on with his life despite his terrible trial, she was labeled as suspected and hated by understanding even when It was clear that she did not kill her own child. The media began a squabbling and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the whole nation glued to their sets as they spun this family piece by piece. And overall, Lindy remained as magnanimous as ever, even though her husband Michael was falling apart. Of course, this attitude is the strength of power, as unsympathetic as it may seem, and people happen to react strongly to it. They want to see a distressed mother crying and crying and occasionally weak at every turn, not sitting there and looking blank. People do not understand that not everyone loves the same way, and when someone decides to stand strong, they begin speculation. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and thus creates a cold but not unpleasant woman, one who stood by her beliefs even though they cost her freedom. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to slowly dissolve his character in despair - somebody or Chamberlain's would be too detached, and no one will see it. Apart from the monster that is at the time of this writing, the news media becomes. They always eat the trash and feed the missing slurry to the uninformed public.
