Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in The Sopranos. He died by being shot in the eye. This was the best and well-organized scene ever in the soprano. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone will haunt Uncle Junior in her dreams until Uncle Junior can't take it anymore. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode 3, denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy will continue forever. Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character ever. I recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and good instructions and produce because it doesn't get better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
