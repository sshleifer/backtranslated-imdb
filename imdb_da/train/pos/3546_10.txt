One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where the producers and the director were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, rather than what people might expect. The lighting and setting are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name I can't think of). The dialogue is also unique, as no contracts are used. The film is well paced, beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish. A real joy is the music. Such a selection of first-class songs, from start to finish, perfect and orchestrated. The music is also very original and very memorable, and I think better than many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which may only have two or three. Not bad for an instructor without experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
