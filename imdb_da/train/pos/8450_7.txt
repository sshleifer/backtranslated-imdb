Wasn't really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the end was really really shocking to everyone who attended and those who looked home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener, these two can seriously put a good fight if they had more time to put on a wrestling match. Flair wins the DQ after Edge strikes him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 OTHER MATCH-TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad to notice the fact that this is the first time these Divas were standing together in the ring. Mickie goes to a modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks and nails her own Chick Kick to win to keep her title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH-TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Seriously, this fight was real. The HHH fight focuses on the Big Show's damaged arm, but the Big Show is still fighting back. Later HHH is able to overturn the Big Show & nails a pedigree to the victory. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH-SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISA {This was a bonus game} Not so bad, it was okay. After Viscera was down behind the judge, Benjamin's mom got a bag {which had bricks in it} and slammed Viscera upside down with it three times. Viscera rose only to be caught with a spinning heel kick by Benjamin for the victory against big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTE MATCH-JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow and sloppy. Both men did not really do a very good job. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for victory. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST FIRST WOMEN'S GUARANTEE MATCH It was pretty entertaining for me. Ashley (I think) eliminates Candice last to win the first ever Women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH-JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. COURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN A ELIMINATION CAMS MATCH FOR WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool Elimination chamber match. But nothing will top last year's Elimination Chamber, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on the Masters and gets a roll-up on him to remove him. Seconds later, the Cena role on Carlito for the three counts to win the Elimination Chamber and keep its WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet and says that Edge is cashing in the bank's cash opportunity to challenge Cena to the title. Edge comes out with Lita, gives the document folder to Vince and heads off in the ring as Cena has another fight to come here tonight. <br /> <br /> Eight MATCH-JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena, busted open during Chamber match} is immediately bound by Edge, Edge saw nails a Spear on Cena, goes to the cover and to his shock Cena breaks out. Edge nails another spear & covers for the shocking three counts he has beaten Cena & has won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Years Revolution was better than this year, but it was still okay. The EC fight was also good, and the shocking of Edge cashing in its MITB capability is certainly the most shocking on the PPV show. Overall: I give it 7/10 and a C
