Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena in the mid-twentieth century, much like the phenomas we see today (back in the 70s - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this movie). It made Novak a great star, put a good topic on Jack Lemon's resumption, shed new light on Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore in their career (both continued to play witches and other curious "old bats" In movies and television). Along with the 40s movie I married a witch (which helped make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great movie and television fascination with every thing that was pursued with Bewitched and continued through Practical Magic , Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What I rarely see is that the movie is also a pretty interesting alternative to Xmas movie. The story takes place over the Christmas holiday, and despite being superficial about witchcraft, it is actually a big part of Christmas Eve (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (has seen it several times since my first show in the early 90s), especially if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style, fabric, a great casting and amazing production values. And as Adam's Rib, it randomly expresses ideas that were quite radical for its time, is radical itself now (in both films, the female character is innocent and powerful) and then it always seems ahead of time.
