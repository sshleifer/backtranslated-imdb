This film of two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just amazing! It's not an idealistic movie, I want to say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place. The characters are very nice, but they also have some "dark" sides, which makes you believe these are real people. Great movie with great actors to show that life is not fun all the time, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
