I just watched this lovely Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. Although this movie, subtitle in English, has ballroom dancing as its heart, the film actually shows the world outside of Japan, how the rigid structures of family, employment (wage) and recreation still exist in today's Japan. <br /> <br /> Author / director Suo Masauki [I follow Japanese custom to present The family name (surname) first and the specified name (last)] use the not so popular ballroom dancing theme to show Japan's social structure . <br /> <br /> [I also don't want to use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with Japanese formal names that can confuse. I will refer to <br /> <br /> the actors by their professionally functioning name as stated in the Internet Data Movie Base.] <br /> <br /> He listens to his real wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and so far only movie. She is a dance teacher on her father's dance study. Yet her true ambition is to compete once again in an international dance competition, which she was disqualified from earlier. No, I don't want to say "why." Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the movie's star. A 25-year-old veteran since 1979, he gives a sterling performance of a 40's something companion <br /> <br /> who has a lovely wife, teenage daughter and just bought his <br /> <br /> longing. <br /> <br /> And yet, some of its own inner happiness lacks. Watch this movie to learn how to become "involved" with ballroom dancing and secretly going to <br /> <br /> lessons. Most dancing characters are released from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure. They are friendly and warm and welcoming. Of course, this is in stark contrast to how Japanese society is structured with its place for everyone and everyone in its place. The movie has so many fun moments. The nearly 1,500 theater guests broke into spontaneous laughter during many of the comic moments. This evidence <br /> <br /> that the comedy does not have foreign languages. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is fun and brilliant as well as Watanabe Eriko. They are two fun character actors. <br /> <br /> You could buy and read a textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or you could see this fine movie and start understanding how <br /> <br /> People in Japan grow up in a rather stiff social structure. Watching the movie "Are we going to dance?" is a rapid immersion in further study and display of other <br /> <br /> Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's fun, it's charming, it makes you cry a little, and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
