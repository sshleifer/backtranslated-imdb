In fact, this movie has stupid moments, both in the claymation section and in Joe Pesci and the kids, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But as a dying Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yes, it's half my life, you!), I can't complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid it would get a much lower grade for me if my beloved Mike hadn't been the first with it. But since no one but Mike IS moonwalker, it must get 7 out of 10 from me.
