There were many things that went against this movie for me before I saw it. <br /> <br /> First, I was a typical high school senior, in a Shakespeare class, I didn't really even suffer much less understanding half of! Shakespeare would not be more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted player ... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language .... and then I would still not get the most. <br /> Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought it could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood the whole language as it was done. Now the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in the Shakespeare class. And here I was open and I understood it. I doubted myself while watching the movie almost! But look and see ... when it's done, and only then does Shakespeare come to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is really a master who wrote amazing stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the big budget movie mode (with beautiful filmography and photography) and appeared amazingly by Brannagh and somehow thrown .... I understood what was going on. What was said. The language is amazing and passionate. It allows for more raw emotions ... when words cannot describe anything, Shakespeare's words may be. <br /> <br /> I still hold to this day that the North Star fist (animated, English dub) is the greatest movie ever made. No movie gives more pure entertainment. But for a movie to get close to the dethroning Fist from the position (which Hamlet did - it came close) is truly amazing .... awe inspiring. It wasn't a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, really powerful movies out there. This gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of endless stars. Yes Yes. By the way, all your kids out there in a Shakespeare class ... forget it. You waste your time. You must see the games performed. Only then will justice be done for them.
