I really enjoyed this movie as a young child. At that age, I thought the stupid baseball antics were funny and the movie was "cool" because of it's about sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed movie was like. This film opened my eyes as a toddler to the battles that other children dealt with and real world problems. That kind of exposure largely lacks children's clubs these days, which I don't think is for our society's benefit. Sure, baseball antics seem very stupid now, but they took children. Disney realized this fact and exploited it to teach these children an important lesson on the world. As a young adult, Al and the other angels' performances look far less impressive, but I will give credit to the actors who play both children and Danny Glover, who all did a fantastic job.
