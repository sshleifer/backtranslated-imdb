I really really enjoyed this movie. (That's why it surprised me that it was so low rated by so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy snowy night. It's fun, exciting, and a great tale of women's friendship ups and downs that last through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each other! (Fess up ladies, we've all been there!) Bill Paterson shines like Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove she can be a great actress when the role is right and she puts it on it. (And really, there's the best "wedding getaway" I've ever seen or dreamed in this movie ... more guts than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh and you'll cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this movie is about to market .... it is a hidden gem that should have done the TONNES of the box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
