I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever. When I looked at Valentine, I was amazed at how big the story actually was. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not at all terrible. The actors and actors played the parts wonderfully, and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a bit incredible and or poor, and I admit to a few minor parts that it was just a little boring, but generally it was nonstop entertaining and exciting. It had a mind-twisting story line that made you guess all the way through and it doesn't deserve all the game it gets. I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's safe to give you lots of chills. Oh, and don't even notice the trailer OR rating, please, NOT ...
