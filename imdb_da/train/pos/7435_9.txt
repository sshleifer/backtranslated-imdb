I first saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent and I still do. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge rates a lot with me. Anything that could detract from the beauty of the dike or the power of history would not get my vote for expertise. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it. Okay, so there wasn't a big budget for the project. So it wasn't Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can reject Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations as part of the presentation? The above comment, which in just four lines rejects the video as a piece of garbage, is grossly unfair and unperceptive. I'm the producer's friend, but that's not my reason for this comment. Rather, I defend a work of art that I think has value at all levels. It is well-suited to bringing Coleridge's poems to students in a way that awakens their understanding of it and arouses their sympathy for the lesson the ancient Navy gives.
