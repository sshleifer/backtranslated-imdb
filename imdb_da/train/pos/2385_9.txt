In the old advertisement for empty audio cassettes was labeled "is it right or is it Memorex?" The same can be said for the events of this episode - a compilation and remix of "The Cage", the first pilot of Star Trek. Sir. Spock has appropriately commanded the ship to take it to the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Capt. Christopher Pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, returns there. Why Finestling? Because having any contact at all with Talos IV invites a death sentence. Why this is so, has never been explained - it bothered me tremendously - but if not, it adds the story. After getting the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spoke on to Dr. McCoy (the top officers present, Capt. Kirk was away from the ship) for arrest and saying, "The blame is mutiny, Dr. I have never received orders to take over the ship." What follows is a court battle where we - thanks to the talos - learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for Capt. Pike to come to Talos IV, even in danger of Mr. Spock's death. The illusions that the talos create, the background music and the whole story are amazing. And Meg Wyllie as Keeper (Head Talosian) is wonderful. Call me sexist, but it never happened to me to have a woman in that role, but she was perfect! The Talos, who have given up almost all physical activities and almost completely depend on the power of illusion, are also unisex; You can't really tell if they are male or female, and it really doesn't matter. This episode, more than nearly everyone else in the series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a nice thing if this were so! This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I've seen it (I have it myself on video), it never fails to fascinate me. Me Wyllie LOOKER as a foreigner, and I DO NOT mean unnecessarily.
