For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon, watching this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In this context, it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy lame and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. The Plot Line is also a bit slender for today's audience, but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. Jane, you have to remember was part of the escapist's fantasy during the years of the war, created to increase the troops morale. She gave a double meaning to the "strip" in the comic strip. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with Edgar Rice Burrough's and Rider Haggard's tales. The theme would have been known to readers of that era, a bunch of bumbling Nazis who were persecuted by a couple of equally bumbling Englishmen and of course in African jungle. For Jane fans, a must see. For the rest of you, a damp squib <br /> <br />
