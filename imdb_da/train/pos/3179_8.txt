Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a great sense of humor ... This Zany, Surrealistic film-making style is appealing, but it's hard to create - or easy to forget - the fabric and character that actually has souls is what gives such a depth of film . Without it, a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. So what. It can be laughing, but it goes through you as a half-good hamburger ... next ... Crosseyed doesn't want to change anything, but I appreciate the depth and substance. They slip on you. I started this movie thinking "Oh, I get it - indie comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... yup." And that's it - but if you watch it, there are subtitles and characters moments that fill it out. In this way, the film draws the breath. It gives suggestions that pause - if you are available to see them - and then of course it goes in its crazy joyful way. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign a contract to suspend belief in moments in the movie. Stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points in this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but wise people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The dining room scenes are absolute. <br /> <br /> Put on the seat belt.
