This is a really cool movie! I remember first seeing it when I was really young, and I used to watch it all the time as once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really fun and it's really cool how they train the animals to do all these things. However, parts of the movie are sad (as when Sassy, ​​the cat falls into the waterfall, and when the shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I've seen the other Homeward Bound, but I have to say it's not as good as it first. Shadow is the wise, Sassy is, Well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
