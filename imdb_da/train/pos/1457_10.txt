I've seen this documentary twice - and although I'm a big movie drama, most documentaries don't keep my attention. However, this film was fascinating. Almost every shot is perfect - says so much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is amazing, I can't praise it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Fantastic and excellent selection of interviews - movie from a factory in China - the movie makes you feel like you're actually there. <br /> <br /> I am politically aware - and I have read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this movie that was a surprise to me. But it has made me think so much. <br /> <br /> So much so that this world was a better place. <br /> <br /> One million kudos for the filmmaker - and thank you for making this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I wish everyone could see it.
