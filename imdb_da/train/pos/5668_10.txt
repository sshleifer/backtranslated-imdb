I stumbled upon this series by chance. After half an episode I was connected. American Gothic was a dark, strange series of Gary Cole as the mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck, trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by Gary Cole's outrageous sheriff, and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Lucas Blacks Caleb was able to resist Sheriff Buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a television series. I have rarely seen a children's actor with as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you weren't lucky enough to see Lucas in American gothic, then see him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during the short run.
