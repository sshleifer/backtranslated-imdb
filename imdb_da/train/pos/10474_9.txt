I was incredibly impressed with this movie. It contained basic elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just a genius musician who hit the rock bottom, but it was about a man who was afflicted with grief, and tried to find comfort in his music. He finds a companion who comes with his own problems. Claire and Des were able to supply each other with friendship and love, but more importantly a conclusion about events that had shaped their lives to the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character by today's standards for a rock star. Still, he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate, while things around him literally go to ruins. His focus is to create his whale music, it becomes an obsession for him. Claire is the street child who needs a place to live. She finds hidden talents while in the Des company. She also finds a common friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him over a period of time. <br /> <br /> These two love each other. Not mind blowing, sex infused kind of passion, but a love where friendship and understanding means more. For two people who have been hurt, they find trust together.
