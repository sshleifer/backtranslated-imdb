not against the soundtrack being played out now. <br /> <br /> Still, Debra Winger is always interesting, and while this was a former role for her, she is pretty good as Cissy, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, lived in trailer with Bud, (Travolta) which was to be replaced only for a time by the city slams Madolyn Smith as a rival. I agree with a previous review about Scott Glenn, he is only used for plot, thrown into the mix to create excitement; The story is predictable and constructed. Although I am from the East, many of us did not resemble Saturday Night Fever, while it had its moments, the eternal stereotypes are without criticism on this point. Worth seeing for Debra Winger; She is still so sympathetic and has never had the Hollywood persona we are exposed to too many actresses today. 10.7
