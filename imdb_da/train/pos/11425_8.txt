The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it is so much more than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone growing up in the south will experience the same things. A yearning for another, one of another race that cannot be executed. Even a look is forbidden. There are no words needed. Their facial expressions say it all. It is the story of a black servant, the Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other. <br /> <br /> The little girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends her entire time with Protée. She really can't see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the more annoying aspects of the movie is the laziness of the colonies. They can't even get dressed for bed themselves. Where the world is about to end they just don't know. Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I'd like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you only hear the animals.
