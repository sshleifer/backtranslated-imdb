Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: Man With the Gun. Tollinger is a professional city tamer - as in when a city needs someone to save itself; He is the one who is brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest performance comes as an accident: Walking in the city is looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a city played as a doll by a local western gangster. But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning up becomes very taxing (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /> <br /> Man With The Gun starts as an average Western hard movie, but begins to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What starts as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends dark and character-centered. The whole movie is very well shot and the casting is very entertaining. Mitchum is his usual excellent himself here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and efficient hard-boon-screen presence in high gear and he paves the action packed, meaningful and shocking scenes of the movie out of the park. Man With The Gun is a lovely Mitchum western and is easily worth a time.
