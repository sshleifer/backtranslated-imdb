What can I say about that? It's another Hollywood's very high budget prison ($ 80 million). Not quite scary, it gives us only a few tensions and a really scary sequence with the skeleton in the fireplace. Very computer-generated special effects and no more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of Hill House is stunning, all of these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! But I do not like the end because it was so delicious. Check this one out and formulate your own opinion about it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
