Unlocking your daughters is one of the best high-voltage comedies I've ever seen. It is misunderstood as it lacks the "social comments" values ​​that many films of the day (1969) required to be successful. People are over-the-top satirs of ordinary people and are played for that purpose by all actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines particularly brightly as Lord Foppington, a noble hair too big to fit into the door. <br /> <br /> The reason involves the things of the usual century; erroneous identities, falsified romances, corrupt officials and jokes in each turn. <br /> <br /> It answers the questions: What happens when 4 rambunctious, eager to party sailors are on holiday in a small British coastal town? And who do they involve themselves in, and how does it all go? <br /> <br /> Despite being poor at the box office, it has great costumes, excellent music (based on the Mermaid Theater musical with the same name), big, lively plays and sets that are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> It's never been released on either VHS or DVD is really a shame as so many bad movies are released every day.
