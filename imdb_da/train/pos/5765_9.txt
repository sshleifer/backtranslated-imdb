Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre. As I understand from the comments and the things I've read, it was made during the immense Midwest River in 1993, when half of Missouri was under water. Buildings were under water. cars and houses were under water. An article said that zombies and the crew of this movie would help the sandbag river after shooting every day. The fact this movie was made at all is a miracle. It's like a great mashing of every zombie film ever made through a Troma filter. It's a party movie to enjoy with friends who like lots of splatter and goofy characters. And it's fast and energetic and really fun. <br /> <br /> A toxic waste accident in a nuclear power plant causes people to melt down or become zombies. The local government covers it, tears down the factory and builds houses over it. Some earthquakes (?) Get a hole open to develop, and some new residents find the cave and release the undead in the newly built community. From there it just gets crazy and yawn and fun. <br /> <br /> I've read these reviews a few times. And of course, it seems to me that the same person attacked this funny little movie three times as another reviewer by using fake names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. It has some bad plays. It also does half of the movies. There is very much out there than this funny movie. If you hate this movie so much, don't buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and calling the crew or throwing "Trailer Trash." And it is obvious that you are not from Australia or England. It's just worrying that this great service, IMDb doesn't catch people using it just to take others. There are bad reviews and good reviews and I don't mind them. I give both bad and good reviews myself. But it is painfully obvious that some fools will just use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "Reviewers" even obey their "review" themselves to promote their own films. One called this movie Boring - well, love it or hate it, one thing you can never say about this movie is that it is boring. It goes fast and never has a dull place. <br /> <br /> Oh and this reviewer from Holland ??? About - LIAR. You tried to post this same review on Amazon and it was yanked there. The same review said it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense must stop. Love it or hate it - give it a real review or write nothing. It's obvious that you haven't seen the movies. <br /> <br /> But for the post I have, and although this is not the best I have seen, it is far from the worst. And even the worst I would give a real REVOEW and would not attack the director personally. Hope this review helps some people through the stupidity going on here.
