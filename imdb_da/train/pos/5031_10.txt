This movie is beautifully designed! There are no errors. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is best in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in tones of his voice are without miscue. Every shot carefully done! Surprises show up after each other when the film reaches its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a gem that has been very well polished. It is not for the simple mind.
