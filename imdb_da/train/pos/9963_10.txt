I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I've had it every time. Sure the graphics are a bit cheesy, compared to now, but back in the 70's it was fantastic. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. That's how I remember my Christians were with my family - magically. Santa Claus was great and I couldn't wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, let them look at this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version than we are used to today, but who says there's a way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children well vs. bad. I do not know how the English subtitle version is or if there is an English, but the Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Merry Christmas!
