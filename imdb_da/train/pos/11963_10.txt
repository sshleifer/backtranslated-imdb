"Scoop" is easily Woody Allen's funniest film from the 2000s so far. Allen, although he finally sees his age, is at the top of his game as low-stick doctor Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and demeanor are fun. Don't let the critics swing your mind. "Scoop" is a top section "Woody-Lite" image. <br /> <br /> The classic music score is an excellent compliment to the on-screen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in the bathing suit. Jackman is dashing. The camera lights up. "Scoop" is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish. The last shot of the movie alone is worth recording the prize.
