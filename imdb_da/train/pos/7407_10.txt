This movie took me by surprise. I saw it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There were many truths that this movie was recorded. I also love all the characters in this movie. This movie makes a lot of sense because society "gets more advanced" What loses the culture? Not to sound preachy. I can really relate to this movie from my child's hood and lose each other in my life that never comes back or ever been the same. This movie is on my top 5 movies I've ever seen. There is just such a true truth that I feel when I see the movie, and it's not the kind of truth you have to dig for right in front of your face. The creators of this movie did a good job and I enjoyed much of this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
