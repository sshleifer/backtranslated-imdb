The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles sounds doomed as no production can capture the idea of ​​the actual historic Beatles. Then it may be best not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material. This is exactly what the 'Beatles' birth offers us, the simple story that is known to us without anything extraordinary. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here at *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles candidates might expect. The Beatles are seen performing songs that were hardly even composed of that time. The Beatles perform "Ask me why", "S. I love you" and even "don't bother me". The Beatles candidates will see that if the Beatles on the movie only performed songs as they actually did in Hamburg, the younger viewers can no longer recognize the Beatles they have learned to know them. Of the original Hamburg repertoire there is only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe's "Love Me Tender". <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production hardly look like the originals, but the rest of the movie still makes a good impression as the movie is quite accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is amazing, and the moment he saw Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also as a bonus you will see the original Cavern Club in the movie.
