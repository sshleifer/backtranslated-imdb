Probably the best picture Producers Releasing Corp has ever made, this little horror rivets attention from first to last. Director Frank Wisbar, of course, knows a good story when he writes one, and what's more important, he knows how to realize his full shock potential on the screen. Not only is the plot involved and the characters fascinating, but the setting is totally out of this world! Almost all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging, pierced fog. This chilling atmosphere is enhanced by Wisbar's inventive direction and the convincing beliefs he has drawn from all his players. The lovely Rosemary La Planche is an ideal heroine, beautiful, exciting but vulnerable. Robert Barrat delivers his usual no-nonsense, straight down line portrait of the local bigwig, although it's hard to believe that the nice, nice guy playing his son is none other than the later dullsville author / instructor Blake Edwards.
