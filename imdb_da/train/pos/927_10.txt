"Prides of the Pride" was another of the good shows that unfortunately did not have a very long life. And it's pretty sad, especially if you're considering that the worst shows are still almost in the air (think in "The Simple Life") I admit that there are many similarities with this show and "The Simpsons" but despite The similarities, the show has its own merits. The animation is just adequate, not incredible, but good. The best part is the signs. All the animals are very cozy and fun, and even Sigfried and Roy had their moments. The music was good, I liked many of the songs. Although the show is not so original, I think this had many options. Like "Mission Hill" a show that is not very famous, but I liked a lot, it did not have the appreciation it deserved. What a shame .
