I must start by telling you how I encountered this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around 1990. One of my friends from Australia lived with me and my girlfriend in a shoe box of an apartment. Winners in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch something coming on television. I had found this movie outside a store that was in a snowbank and just now it was a treasure. It's probably the best worst movie ever. We spent the next two weeks in this movie and drunk like fish. We saw it so many times in reality that sometimes we could turn on the TV on its side or on the head for a more full filling effect. It's a real gem. The laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You will not regret it!
