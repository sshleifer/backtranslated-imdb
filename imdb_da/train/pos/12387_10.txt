Of all the films from the seventies, no one was caught to the true essence of the good against evil struggle that did Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like the exorcist and others; but none of them caught the human element in the main character like this. If you have time, check this out. You may not be able to get past the dated units as such, but it's a story worth getting into. Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle tracks that lead to what's going on too. Be observant. I had to see it four times to capture all the less weird statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake". Plus, the books are also really good. I'm just sorry they won't hit the other book in a movie. It's so scary that it would surpass this movie.
