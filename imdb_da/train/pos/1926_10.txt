In 1967, I visited the Lake Elsinore glider gate and flew a yellow Pratt Read sailing plan. Returning to Germany, the above mentioned ran on television, and a segment was about high-altitude sailplanes in California in the early 50s. (The real pilot was Bill Ivans, I don't know who played him in the series) It turned out that the sailing plane in the movie was the same (same N-number) as I had flown on Lake Elsinore. Ever since I saw the segment I have been searching for it and wondered if it is an accessible place. (Other segments in the serious deal were about Baker Ejection Seat; an instrument for finding avalanche victims, etc.).
