I remember seeing it here when I was 3 years old, so my parents taped everywhere, but a few seconds with another cartoon. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it, and then I could understand things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I rediscovered it thanks to some internet articles / video clips, and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but for us 20-30 somethings, it's certainly "Cult Status" written over it. It is a pity that the original production went through a painful process; If Fox gave it enough time, it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to re-insert it with a completely different story and an all-star voice cast it could be, but it is for Fox to decide. I fall here, I know. I still think it's a good movie, but it could be better than good.
