I was happy to finally see the release of Amazing Stories the first season on DVD. I had forgotten just what a star actor of actors and directors worked on this series. Long ago, the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when Sci-Fi would re-perform the episodes. But when Sci-Fi will host re-runs, they are generally in the same episodes. There were a few excellent episodes in the Season One as Mission that they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series ran? It says 1985 to 1987 at the top of IMDb, but I thought it ran longer than two years. If you loved the Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and External Borders, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
