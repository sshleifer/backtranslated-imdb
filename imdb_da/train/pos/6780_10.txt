Colman's performance is aided by the excellent written script. The giant Hollywood studios of the 30s and 40s could copy some of the German expressionist film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood movies. very good use of shadows and lights and silhouette. I really liked the scene where colman turns off the lights in his dressing room near the beginning of the movie, and he begins to recite Othello while his face is instantly dark and evil. The viewer already sees the text and drama in Shakespeare, which gets hold of "Tony" and out of which he goes on his death penalty. I also enjoyed the dramatic death scene in the play when he was overwhelmed by emotions, and accidentally stroking his cost a little too hard for her to wear. her post "tony stop you hurt me" chiller and exciting. You just don't know if he should go over the top and kill her at any time. The cat and mouse hunt to reveal the killer was nicely added 2 / 3rds by the way through the movie to add some faster pacing and also add to the narrative in the movie. Masterful work from George Cukor. He is such a skilled instructor. Excellent movie. Too bad they don't make them as they used to ...
