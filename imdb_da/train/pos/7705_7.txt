I have seen it here about 10 times, so there must be something about what I like! <br /> <br /> 50s of American sci-fi movies were basically a mixed group: they were either intelligently made and / or thoughtful or inexpensive and ridiculous cheese. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in the rarity of the genre, color. <br /> <br /> It also had a start with the script - although Shakespeare may not have recognized it, it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed some longevity even if it went well. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a man's murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left lit 200,000 years before. Along the way, the plot jumps with 50 s stereotypes and corn so clean, you sometimes wonder why you see it, but always do it. The girlfriend triangle thing ... yuk! Disney's cartoon still holds well, and cartoon backgrounds right out of the covers of the Galaxy magazine, etc. Looks good even after 50 years. Robbie drives the car over the desert in remote, but that's an idea! <br /> <br /> All in all, with all the flaws, the best of its kind, and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives.
