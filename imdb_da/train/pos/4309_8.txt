Many of the comments people have made strike me as (sorry) missing the point. Kasdan wants to present life, simply the ordinary life. The traditionally structured story, where characters have insights that change their lives, then fade out, music up, and the film is over, absorbed in this much larger canvas. More characters in this movie have only such lights, and then they go on. Sometimes they can stick to their insights, sometimes they can't, and that's the way life really is. In other words, Kasdan jettison's conventional dramatic structure in favor of exploring the continuity of life ?? there is no happy end, only a possible end; and everything before it is still running, is it still alright? And if you absolutely insist on a theme, explore the miraculous role of our lives. What is a miracle? Well in life, for a start. Then add all the random events and cross-links that make up a life or multiple interconnected lives and you have miracles of bucketful. Kasdan emphasizes this theme easily, rather than insisting on it, and strengthens it in various ways, most memorably of the device, right in the middle of the movie, having Mac and his wife lying in bed, each dreaming their own dreams, but Also shows later in the film how these dreams have power within the film to shape reality. This is not a movie with a light or obvious message. Just let it play out in front of you and let it sit in your mind for a few days, a month, a few years, and see what it has done there. This is undoubtedly Kasdan's best film, his most mature, his most humane. A great meditation on the life of one of our most gifted writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now, mainly because of study requirements about "Dreamcatcher". Hopefully we haven't heard the last from Larry Kasdan. A great movie from a great artist. Keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize completely in order to succeed.
