This is unlikely to be voted on this year's best comedy, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. But we are talking about a movie where a hitman and a white bread dealer become friends, so a few vagaries should not come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, away is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality, he hopes he will continue to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnans straight man. I've read a few negative comments here about Hope Davis, but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep inside. There are lots of good chuckles when Brosnan strikes and a few scenes where I almost died laughing. My father (a consultant) almost lost it when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator". Much like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another hit-man comedy, humor can be very dark. If you're into being prepared to enjoy yourself.
