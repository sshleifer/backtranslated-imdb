** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only got a Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, the decent Agent Under Fire and the boring Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I planned to get was All or Nothing, because my friend told me it was better than the two games I already had. I must say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for a tooth in HMV, and when I got home I put it in my cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games and there was a much better and more interesting story. Graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to the man). The story was clever; Crazy Man (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and handsome henchwoman (Heidi Klum, called Katya Nadanova), tries to destroy the world with small nanobots, which at the beginning of the game, you James Bond, must destroy a train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's breasts. You must then force their plans and save the world. The big thing about this game is that it actually has actors expressing the characters, such as Cleese voicing Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them rather long and difficult. Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Audio - 9/10 Repeat Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90%
