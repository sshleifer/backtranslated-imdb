"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This hugely entertaining movie takes you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs, surprises and unexpected touches. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost any other movie from 2005. It's a crazy movie with an unforgettable character played perfectly by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs (murder rich dudes). He also experiences something that resembles a mid-life crisis. Having acknowledged that he has no real friends, not a firm home and no future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and enters Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a down-his-luck family man who is losing the big business deal that can only turn things around for him. He loves his wife deeply, especially because they lost their young son a few years earlier. The two men are chalk and cheese, hardly any common ground except they are in the same deserted bar night. And somehow there is a conversation that sets in motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. The friendship they create reminded me of a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the equal man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble. The interaction is fantastic timed and fine-tuned, which is not due to the wonderful performance by Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is Brosnan's movie. He imprints one of the most memorable and despicably sympathetic characters in the decade. He could shoot your mother and immediately apologize and you would forgive him. Brosnan may be the cinema's ultimate charm, but it is his most endless and complete performance to date. I would not be reluctant to see an Oscar key for this role. Consider a scene where he revealed a high school girl with unclean thoughts and radiates the line "All blushy blushy ... No sucky fucky". He does it with the well-known Bond smirk and manages to get away with it. He manages to tell a young boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years. Then come back to me" without coming across as unlikely. In fact, it makes us even more like him. <br /> <br /> And yet, the movie may surprise us with some really touching scenes, most of them coming to the end when the movie takes some unpredictable turns. But when Julian thumbs through her little black book to find someone to call on the birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of feeling. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is stylish and energetic. It is constantly entertaining. And it contains a career-defining role for Brosnan as the lonely man who seeks normality, friendship and a means of doing at least one good thing in his life. This is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to watch this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler or IndependentCritics.com
