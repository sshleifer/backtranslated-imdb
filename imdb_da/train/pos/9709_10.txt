I accidentally hit the LoG for the first time while he was on TV: since then I have never missed an episode. It's humor is very strange, as a cross between Brass Eye's social commentary, the Fast Show is excellent one-liners, and a fantastic plot that seems to evolve every week without ever going anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special thing - what was that about? <br /> <br /> Humor won't appeal to everyone. Some say it's just too sick and it's easy to see where they come from. Try it anyway. If you don't like it, don't see it, but if you like it, you'll be glad you took my advice.
