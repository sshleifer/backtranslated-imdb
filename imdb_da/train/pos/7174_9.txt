I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to watch this movie premiere - and really glad I did. As a great movie fan and a lifelong Northern Californian, I was surprised at how many Oscar winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas's persistence, community and vision comments have really been the subject of me. <br /> <br /> Hello, if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF, then other artists can. <br /> <br /> Would recommend this movie
