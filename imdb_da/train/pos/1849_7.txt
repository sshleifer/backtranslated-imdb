"Antwone Fisher" tells of a young black American navy and man and a product of childhood abuse and neglect (Luke) whose hostility toward others causes him to make an effort with the base shrinkage (Washington) leading to introspection, self-assessment and a return to his roots. Pat, sanitized and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a solid feeling-good flick about reconciling past regrets and closures. Good old Hollywood-style entertainment family appreciates entertainment with just a hint of corn. (B)
