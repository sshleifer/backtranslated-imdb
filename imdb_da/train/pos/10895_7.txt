Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly fun movie, especially considering the bad advertising when it was first released. Ben Affleck is fun as an unpleasant millionaire who pays the family who occupy his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. He then drove the family family with overindulgence to the Christmas greeting. I haven't been a Ben Affleck fan before (although I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well cast in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter of the family who can't stop Affleck's character first. Sure you can see where this movie goes, but you don't care. Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
