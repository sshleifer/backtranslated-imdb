Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir's juice is Hopper's eerie, violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness. <br /> <br /> A driver gets wrong for a hitman and tries to make some dough out of it, but gets over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage enters a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling done by his buddy ... and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain when drawn Do the same! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Here, Dennis Hopper is best here ... cocky, cramped, disgraceful, sweet and explosive. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man with a dark past who tries to live legitimately (yes almost). There are only 4 real signs here, except the hard-working substitute in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first twist hits early, and from there it is a lovely neo-noir adventure in a sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts.
