The 35 year old sees Groove Tube much like the real TV today! Special niche networks (key sports), a TV show on stoner-drug dealers called the dealers (ala weeds and even previous 1978's Cheech & Chong Up in Smoke), nice beer advertisements (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls) -minded kid's clown Koko (shades of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase makes slapstick humor (a fierce barbershop vocal duo) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube for an initial X rating, I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking about naked dancing hippyhippies ---- For similar sketch-style movies, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and Firesign Theater's Everything You Know are wrong.
