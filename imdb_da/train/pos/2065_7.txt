Terrible Symmetry is a pleasant episode with few errors. The first thing about the episode is that it is near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. The season's 'Deep Throat' takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho. I wonder if airbase bases are one and the same, but they decided to use the right name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. They must have wanted children at once, you just can't imagine how. Just as he must have cared more for animals at some point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt it had some inconsistencies. If foreigners are so good at abducting people and returning them safely, why can't they put the animal back in the right place? And aliens have just problems returning the animals? I do not buy Mulders theory of a space-time continuum problem. Like he's an expert on it. I also thought Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these nitpicks, I still enjoy this episode because of the exciting concept of aliens who harvest animal DNA as well as human DNA.
