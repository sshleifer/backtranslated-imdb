Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is broken apart, missing her lover; She is not able to overcome her love for him who is lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and lists her mistakes for him with things to repair. But time is irreversible, and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point that impresses in "The Cure" is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color. The concise and sharp manuscript is capable of developing a tragic and gloomy story of love with an unexpected plot point in the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit high and is related to the fact that English is not my native language, for a few moments I needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator. The unknown leading actress has magnificent performance and is extremely beautiful. I hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut from director and author Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
