This is a fantastic classic monster girl from the 50's! I just love the look of the 50s in general as cars and music. Anyway, I love the way blob looks. I love when everyone is late night horror flick in the theater and blob comes in and crashes the party. Another thing I love about it is that it happens all in one night, like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane come out, they see a meteor fall from space. Inside the meteor is the block. When blob consumes a person, it gets bigger and bigger. They are trying to convince the city's citizens of the bare monster, but no one believes them until later. Can anything stop this blobby being? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
