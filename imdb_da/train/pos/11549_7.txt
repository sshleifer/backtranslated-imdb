There is nothing that really doesn't like "The Odd Couple" and it is no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a huge winning comedic team. But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play to make it seem more like a shit on a play comedy show than a full movie. I haven't seen the game but have to assume that the screen version is pretty faithful since Simon wrote it so the errors can't be due to a screen customization. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two newly divorced men who instantly fall into traditional venomous gestures when they become roommates because they know nothing else - that Simon never completely fleshes out. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
