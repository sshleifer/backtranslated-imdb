Although not as wild and as some of Takashi Miike's later films, this is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a police officer of Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to take down a future Chinese mobster. Complicating things is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The movie is actually much more complicated than the one with multiple complications, both of which keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative record. Its this complication and the loss of the road about an hour in the movie that makes this less than a good movie. (It's a very good one). This is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a creepy pace. /> <br /> A word of warning, the violence when it happens, is explosive and ugly. There are also semiotic images of gay sex. If it is not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
