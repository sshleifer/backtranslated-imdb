This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in the subgenre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who at that time had already produced a few WIPs. It is obvious that the film is trying to play with the established formula. The film is in a US prison, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it's an acceptable change in pace. Writer Director Demme really gets into his job and always pigs in new ways to present a familiar scenario. In fact, he is a little too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates a couple of surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious, but it is fun to see how hard he is trying to put this movie over your average chick-in-chains flick. But quietly, Demme still works within the parameters of the subgenre. There is plenty of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a bit slow, but it is very entertaining. Casting is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she doesn't need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a hoot like the wheelchair-based crazy leader. However, Pam Grier is very much missed.
