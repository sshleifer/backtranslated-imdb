"The Last Hard Men" is a typical western for the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford student, and it can clearly be seen in many scenes. The IMO beginning is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey from civilization to the desert. In the third part, there are some illogical errors and I am complaining about Charlton Heston. He has to play an old ex-lawyer named Sam Burgade, but he has a fantastic physical form. I never have the feeling that he really has trouble climbing on a horse or on a rock. For me, he didn't look very motivated as he usually does in most of his epic films. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both had problems with the director or were dissatisfied with their roles. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best, but they are still good. If the screenwriter had John Wayne in their minds like Sam Burgade? Also Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is a little under-utilized in his role. On the other hand, James Coburn is the criminal Zach Provo. Coburn is a really big villain in this one. He portrays the bad guy between galaxy hatred and wisdom. His role and play is the best of the movie. Landscapes and Shootouts are amazing. The shooting scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical western act in the middle of the movie. I would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar. All in all, it's an entertaining western flick. Not a good movie, but above average because of a great Coburn, a very good start and some gory and violent scenes.
