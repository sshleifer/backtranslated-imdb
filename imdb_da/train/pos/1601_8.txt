It is quite simple, not very active, but very charming film. There were moments where I can see why Cher won the Oscar for best actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for the Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe wins, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple low-paid woman who has just been asked by Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises that he will come back in a month when his mother is ill, so she believes that he must have so much of his family that he can participate in the wedding as possible. The only problem is that when she finds Johnny's one-handed brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and love for that moon scene continues (where the title comes from). Oscar also nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, who won Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay written directly on the screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of Night) and Best Picture, it was nominated BAFTAs for best score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 in 100 years, 100 Quotes ("Snap out of it!"), It was number 17 in 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 in 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
