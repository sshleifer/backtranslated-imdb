Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film is a dark surreal look at the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers, essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people extruding a perilous existence into a hard and outrageous post-war city. Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back shows this film how people treat the worst kind of life each in their own way, mostly pulling into themselves and living in the imagination world of their own minds, drawing emotionally from them around them or drown in alcohol. Mixing kitchen-sink realism with Kabuki-esque theatrics, Kurosawa toy expert with feelings of his audience, draws tears and laughter with equal deftness. A wonderful, draining experience.
