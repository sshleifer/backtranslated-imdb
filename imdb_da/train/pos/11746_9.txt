Great play, music. A simple and clear plot, but it took me in and kept me in jail all the way through. I don't know why it was so amazing, but it was simply. So many of the characters were so real. It moved me and made me believe I wanted to see more like this. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a school trip as a forum for such a fantastic plot was a genius and so many of the people were like people were like those who experience everyday teachers in the classroom. <br /> <br /> The movie addresses issues of religion, prejudice, drug abuse, memory, difficult experiences, and simply the diversity of life itself.
