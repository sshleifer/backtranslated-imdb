Miike makes a children's film, not unlike The Neverending Story. It is actually one of my least favorite of the director's films. Even the worst Miike is better than many more movies, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that is worth recommending. It's at least as high and uncomfortable as most American kiddie flicks. I think maybe the kids would find a lot to suffer from it (the DVD contains an English dub), but like all Miike's movies, moving can be very slow. This means that you have got a strange unevenness, where sometimes there is a high action sequence and the next scene will draw forever as a sign. The story itself is not very good either, and Miike's persistent lack of inconsistency makes it ugly. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. This will be Miike's most expensive movie, and it looks great. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and they come in all kinds of amazing shapes, and costume designers, special effects crew, and everybody else involved in the designs did just an excellent job. I watched the 1968 movie that it is supposedly based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the cheesy rubber dust frames you can find have been transformed into more trustworthy devices using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects . I especially liked the look of one of the bad (or girls, in this case), Agi, who grows dark eye shadow, a tight white dress, a white hive and a whip. She is played by Chiaki Kuriyama, who you may remember as Lucy Liu's teenage henchgirl in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The movie's hero is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who gave votes to Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
