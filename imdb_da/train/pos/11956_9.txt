I would even say some shades of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some, if not most Woody fans. Did you know that Annie Hall was first seen as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody regains some relevance in film comedy with this one. The splendor turns are cozy and tight. I want to say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the players are a little too quick to deliver their lines, but stick to them. Scarlett Johansson turns out well cast in the Diane Keaton-type role, and in no time are there unpleasant moments between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine a more perfect actor for Peter Lyman's role than Jackman.
