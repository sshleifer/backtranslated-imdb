I just read the latest comments on this movie and I would like to reply. you are probably not familiar with the original story of the rap group N.W.A. dating back to the beginning of 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left to go solo and eventually in 1991, when the band broke up when Dr. which led to a lot of beef that began with the ice cube and dr.dre expired in 1991. This story was somewhat based on it. <br /> <br /> Even more, this movie was a 90 minute laugh, the way the explained bootie juice song was a political statement was fun. Not to mention "love song" tasty was adherence. And when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked, it's like the record company too, and they're leaders who are shot every time too. People who didn't like this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots, my opinion
