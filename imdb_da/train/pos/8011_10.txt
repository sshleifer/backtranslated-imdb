This was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I know that Miss Piggy's imagination of meeting as infants was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will remain in my head forever. Just to say it because the stupid Nickelodeon show Hey Dude song is still in my head. Sorry, a bit of the subject there. But anyway, what I like is Animal after the credits say "Goodbye, goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Haste Luego!" It made me laugh so hard. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the Sesam Street characters appeared on the wedding. I'm just glad this movie was very entertaining. I've borrowed it from the library, and now I've bought it because I can't keep the library's copy forever. In conclusion, I designate this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
