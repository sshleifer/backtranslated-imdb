I did enjoy this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in Northern Ireland, which is very rarely dealt with in films, most of which tell us about the Republican struggle. The other reason is the actors' notions. I thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native coasts. All in all, it is an entertaining movie star with stellar performances from someone who was cast in Northern Irish actors. It won't move the earth, though it may open some people's eyes to the obscure world of loyalist paramilitary.
