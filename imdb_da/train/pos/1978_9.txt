This production of Oliver is masterful in showing evil layers in the human soul. What makes history remarkable is an excellent bright invisible sign that permeates this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the most serious dangers safely into the hands of his own relative. Yes, even though Oliver goes through the death shadow valley, he fears nothing bad. A rod and staff are there to comfort him. Finally, he is rescued from man's dregs. At the bottom is Fagin, the most wicked of the party. Fagin is considering converting his roads not once, but twice, but still falls because he is not willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes because he raises small pickpockets that become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is effortless, but also untried. The best part is Nancy. Lack of judgment, she ignores Bill Sike's violent nature out of her deep need for love. But, unlike Fagin, at the likely price of his own life, she repented of her sins by rescuing Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality is what makes artificial - unpredictable. I wanted to give this movie a "10", but it was the 70's television soundtrack and atmosphere that was distracting. Overall, a nice parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all the audience.
