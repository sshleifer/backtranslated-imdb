As with all the other reviewers, this movie has been in constant after 30 years. I remember going to the library to investigate everything I could about this story. I wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, all I could find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to 2002 after many years of searching ebay for a weekly basis and there was a VHS copy of the movie. There was another bidder, but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bidder wrote me to ask for a copy that I gave her. Despite having a copy, I still searched and finally searched for a site selling a DVD copy of the movie. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
