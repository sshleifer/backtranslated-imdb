This video is so hilarious fun, it does everything else. Eddie Murphy seems very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and Nutty Professor, who just shows you how good it really is). To be honest, I don't think I've ever loved anything as much as this, including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse. This show is great, although it has to be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F, there are four letters long (plus the extended version begins with M), but it didn't bother me. See it, the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest thing you ever have.
