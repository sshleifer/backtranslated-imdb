Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) <br /> <br /> I think the soprano is one of the best production ever, it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference . It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits the paper like a glove! I would love The Sopranos would never end up at all. It's perfect! It should be a subject in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a child, but I was too young to be waked until the episode ends, so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I see all episodes at home before and after dinner and I become addicted as I did with prison breaks. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best television series. The argument for both is excellent and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on such a work. <br /> <br /> Sorry my English. Thanks for reading.
