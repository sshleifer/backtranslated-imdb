OK Clara Bow style film from 1927, it's a spin-off of Rain, with Bow playing the half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the rigid English engineer - Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attention, but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up (Patricia Dupont). The predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers that he may be on the verge of a fortune. Bow puts her hash quickly. Bow has the personality to save and has a couple of amazing scenes: her open nude bath, hula hula in grass skirt and the hundred and ten with Bow and Brook making their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is incorrect. The movie credits (from DVD I have) list Patricia Dupont who plays Mrs Haldane --- not Margaret Truax as indicated on IMDb.
