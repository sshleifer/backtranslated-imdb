Basically, the movie can be one of the most fascinating titles made by one of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's do it right, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner / thriller ever made. <br /> <br /> When it comes to unhappy tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. Washington was really very comfortable in the shaking cameras and all the running scenes in the movie. One would easily be related to his character feelings therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road. It is a success that they created a super dark Mexico city with many shits happening. One would be easily convinced of the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire. I don't know what the Mexicans would think when they see this ...... <br /> Well, let's see it again. It is among the best of the Death Wish genre, but it has also been subject to extensive violence. It's a little annoying that they justify a vigilant's actions by making the movie very realistic and letting Denzel Washington play that kind of "missing sheep" type tragic hero. Eventually they even had the kidnapper shot in their own swimming pool as a documentary. I controlled IMDb if the movie was based on real events for it ...... So it is for your consideration if you also find the movie's theme is a little fake. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope you wouldn't take that movie right. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for Art Direction / Editing / Cinematographic / Denzel Washington.
