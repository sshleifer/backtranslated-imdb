I examined this movie a little and discovered a site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, warlocks and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the stage play, was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me into a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns or alien monsters, and I was planning to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and knocked his hat away while the camera followed it and fluttered to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme rose, I suddenly got the feeling of being in love. The first movements of romantic / sexual love left me dazed when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy seduced by Kim Novak's astonishing direct glance. It is ironic that a homosexual parable was able to launch heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-monitored the movie last night, and the same emotions touched when I watched the hat touching fifty years later. . .
