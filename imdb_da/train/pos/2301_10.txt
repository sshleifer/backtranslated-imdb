Really ... and incredible movies, though not very popular ... extremely touching and almost life-changing ... at least for me. Worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my favorite movie list .... it's number one now .... <br /> <br /> This is a very touching movie that all people should see .. The Man in the Moon ..... we just want it to be incredible. It is now my favorite movie and I only saw it today, and I would recommend it to anyone over 15 as long as you are a little mature ...... If you don't really try to feel the characters feel, then 'I get never the true meaning and value of this movie .... But it's really incredible .... just watch it because it will change the way some people look at life .... worth seeing 5/5
