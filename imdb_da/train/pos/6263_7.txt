The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on migration of Persha's Bakhtiari tribe. Twice a year, over 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to reach pastures. You will feel like a spoiled weakness when you look at these people, occupy their animals through ice-cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains as they try to get their animals to walk along steep and narrow mountain roads.
