Sentimental and naive, but indisputable influence, emotional man-assisted man, in this case, personified as German and French miners forced to be shut by each other after the Great War thanks to a new border leading to disillusionment on the German side, which the French are the heads. But when a fire begins on the French side, the German men's common decency leads to help, security and even friendship. This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade, as a particular man from Pabst's own side would break that piece and transform the great war into just a foreplay. But it is clear to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism, as this film radiates with this optimism, while his more flippant, cynical adaptation of Threepenny Opera lacked the bite needed to make it work. Also the promotion of his honest conviction is the fact that the characters here are not simplified mouthpieces for posts, but real people, with genuine families whose domestic lives we are also accustomed to. It is ordinary working class men who just happen to believe in the dignity of taking care of and treating your fellow man, and in this day of individualistic opportunism I will take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message representing a point of view as I think we can all strive for. <br /> <br /> (Note: Apparently, the end is cut on most prints where the French rebuild the door, closing the men again, a brutal event, and perhaps making the movie a better overall movie, but I would have regretted it surder positive vibes of the final sequence, in short, I'm glad it was cut.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) of 1931}
