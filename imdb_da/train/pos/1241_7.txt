This movie is very entertaining and any criticism is based on personal preferences - not the quality of the movie. Apart from the usual excessive profanity in some scenes of Murphy, the movie is a great vehicle for its kind of humor. It has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes. As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character begins to look for a missing girl who leads him on the path that others think he was "chosen" - to protect the golden child. The young boy is born as an enlightened, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose life is in danger, if not to Murphy's help and his beautiful, mysterious and mysterious helper / guide / protector. /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lessons to challenge audience members who are interested in considering deep thoughts. Such a scene is where the golden child, whom Murphy's character is encouraged to protect, is tested by the monks in the mountain temple. An older monk presents a tray with decorative necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested at their choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world that most people are completely ignorant of. When we accept this premise of the plot, we must get out of touch with a perceived daily reality and prepare the earth and walls to crumble and reveal a malice just waiting to destroy us. <br /> This is a great movie with a good plot, fine-tuning, and mostly a decent dialogue that combines a serious issue with a healthy balance of martial arts and Eddie Murphy humor.
