"Let's bowl" started on local TV in the Twin Cities. It came late in the evening, something you would stumble upon while the channel is surfing for your 7th bottle of Hamms. Even the ads were produced locally, with Wally outside Grumpy's Bar holding a microphone and nervous - "Ahh ... over to you, Steve Sedahl." Not sure why, but the one always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition that was covered by a two-bowler dispute, but the game was secondary to the comments and clips. Sedahl played it straight, counterbalanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt." Highlights included segments such as "How to Discard An Old Bowling Ball" (chuck them into a lake) and "Dating Tips" where the duo "dates" a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint, "I could have done it myself ! "Another segment - what the duo did on their holidays - featured Steve in beer can stretch the hooves, pigging out of the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the rocks at Taylor Falls, dressed in his tight light blue blazer and over-sized headphones. Hysterically fun! <br /> <br /> Wally's highlighted comments on "league bowlers" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was downloaded by Comedy Central and had some great moments, but the network never really knew what to do with it, drove it in prime time and stressed the bowling competition, which was never the point of show. The constant advertising disturbed the flow, and the side signs (Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else. It all seemed rushed and a little forced. Even Jon Stewart spread Let's Dish at the Daily Show - (not enough lame, crazy jokes?) - A creepy treat for a show that deserved much better. How often does a "Let's Bowl" come into the world of modern television, a locally flavoursome mix of comic genius and total crap? The network has the "total crap" part down cold, but it's a sad thing to see them kill such a dark, strange, fun little gem as "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> Here they hope to put it on DVD.
