"A mouse in the house" is a very classic cartoon of Tom & Jerry, true to their tradition but with its own jokes. It's hysterical, fun, very entertaining and very fun. The artwork is also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short act is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house, and he also tries to catch the mouse because "there will only be one cat in this house in the morning - and that is the cat that catches the mouse". <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are lots of fun gags in this cartoon. For example, the funniest thing for me is when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically "I'm glad you enjoy the siesta" and that she hopes they are happy because she doesn't do two cats gasp. Another fun gag is when Tom spoils himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then makes Butch the same trick for Tom. Of course it is even more fun than this when the real Mammy Two Shoes are shown, and both (stupid!) Cats believe they see each other disguised as Mammy, and then they both attack her at the "back" - lol. Of course she gets angry and when she gets angry, she is not someone to row with. But even Jerry doesn't win this time because he's also expelled from her.
