Unlike some people's summaries, the women depicted in the movie are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous new district, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of art and direction. I felt like I had a glimpse of a time and a place I could never look at. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to see. I would only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It is a good example of both.
