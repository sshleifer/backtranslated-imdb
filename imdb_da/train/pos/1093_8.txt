I always enjoy this movie when shown on TV. <br /> <br /> The one scene that always stands out for me is the one with Myrna Loy and the painter, where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colors, and as soon as she goes away he turns his guys and say "Did you get it, it's yellow, blue, green and white"
