I thought this movie was really good because today in movie theaters in India is all you see is skin, music and bad acting ... in this movie you can see some tradition, ethnicity and at least some decentness. .. although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? That's what Indian movie is all about! after watching this movie, at least you do not get any headaches from all the overstated music or any kind of violence, it is just the truth, it learns about love and of course caring for the person you love your whole life ... i think it was a great movie ... kids can see it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be India's safe depth ... until all these rap hits, miniskirts and skin shows became part of it.
