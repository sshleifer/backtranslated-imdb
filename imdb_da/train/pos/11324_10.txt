I agree with everyone else who posted. <br /> <br /> I saw it a while ago, but I will tell you when I hear certain music from this anime, I recall the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I got when I saw on it, and it makes me cry (such a happy but sad feeling). However, I find that the love story in it felt a little hasty, and they didn't explain things properly, but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I was so much into this anime after the end I just had to do some research (and see the end a couple more times) and I found all my answers and more. I love how they configured historical legends to fit in with this anime, it was great, and I got to explore a lot more. (I've always been very interested in some historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> <I think it should have been a longer series, but if that's all they had to work with, they took it nicely. I would recommend it to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story, well-constructed characters (some mysterious) and a bit of fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Even though this was based on an H game it doesn't have any of the things in it and I actually prefer it this way. (I have no problem with mature anime, in most cases I prefer it)
