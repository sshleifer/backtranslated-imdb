Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with a rude scowl and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight for anyone, especially her father, who pays for her brother's boxing. Diana decides boxing would be a good way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. See how their feelings toward each other are shaped by the square circle.
