Good picture about a man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer slammed the lady, why not just her and let the police try to find out whodunnit? Involving all these signs in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths you'll have to worry about being closed. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit in a chair or say a word? Is there really police out there that is wise cracking, gum popping, grinning monkeys that are approaching a suspect in such a slick way? This probably played well back before the wheel was invented, but it's so cool and incredible today. Capture the manic drum interruption by Elisha Cook; his frenetic hammering never even matched the recording. His crazy facial expression made up for the off-kilter stick synchronization.
