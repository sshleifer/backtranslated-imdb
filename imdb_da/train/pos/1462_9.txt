In this documentary, we meet Roger, the rich head of a factory in China, who makes pearls and other wares and trades at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger argues that factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but interviews with four of them tell a whole different story. The girls' gloomy lives are shown in sharp contrast to the bizarre surpluses of Mardi Gras himself. The film director David Redmon should boast of having excellent and rare recordings of everyday life in a Chinese factory connection and landing a revealing interview on the camera with the head of the American company importing and selling the beads. The film is convincingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind these ubiquitous "Made in China" marks.
