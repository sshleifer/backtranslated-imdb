This is the best version (so far) that you want to see and the most true to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little hard to imagine as Rochester, as Jane Eyre stated "not beautiful". But his performance overcomes this and Zelah Clark, as she is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long clock, but it is worth it. Almost direct quotes from the book are in the manuscript, and if you want the very first true 'romance' in the literature, this is the way to look at it. I own all copies of this movie and have read and re-read the original. The movie may seem a little dated now, but there will never be another like this.
