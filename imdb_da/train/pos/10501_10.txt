Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the biggest game ever created. It's so addictive that you could play it for hours without stopping for a break. I've beaten the game 4 times, but I've never got all 120 stars ... (I've got 111) ... but I hope to reach them eventually. Although I didn't officially play this game until I was seven, I loved watching my sisters play it. Now I'm 13 and still playing this, deleting games and starting again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for an early N64 game. The game is addictive. The controls are good. The levels are hard but not impossible. Bowser matches are challenging. <br /> <br /> I want to tell you more, but why don't you get it yourself? Put away the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and grab yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.
