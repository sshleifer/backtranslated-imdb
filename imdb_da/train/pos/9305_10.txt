This is an excellent independent work that is not associated with anything before or after. Brat Pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits optional, but in this lawless world they make an amazing mood. The film is filled with Our Guys, distinctive actors who separate this work from winning performances. The dialogue is a joy. In fact, it is a new rule of law. One of the few films that can be seen repeatedly with deeper appreciation. <br /> <br /> Highpoints include Billy Idol's British loutishness, Ben London's vulturine brassware, Kyle's bias and the study of ad hoc philosophies.
