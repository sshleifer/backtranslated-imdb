... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). Besides a huge array of fan service for fan girls (it was superfluous ~), it was the story that blew me away. Hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people will disagree with me on this one, but it was not one of the three great actors (the guys who played Sho, the son and Kei) who gave the best performance (for me anyway ). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 from the Royale game! <br /> <br /> I am not mistaken, I like Hyde, I worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little away, but I loved the scene where he danced with the dead guy body kills the other guys. and Gackt was not that bad at all, I preferred how his character was a bit derived from the start. nothing much I can say about my background at Lee-Hom Wang, I do not like to know him, but he brought his own weight with the star cluster. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive me if it's wrong). while the entire song lasts about nine minutes, you will not feel the length because you enjoy hearing Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Yet, this movie is a must-see, not just for the fans (great fan base ~), but for those who enjoy sci-fi, futuristic movies, Asian style.
