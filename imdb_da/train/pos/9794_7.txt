I thought the movie could be a little more complex, in a psychological sense perhaps, but action and voting were top notch. The animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but very good at it. This is one of Batman's Returns / Forever-type movies, which includes romances and conflicts in Wayne and motives for dating. 007 fans would love this, and so would the females, the great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this movie, and Penquin was back to his true form, no mutant genes in him this time! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer geek, something of an Indigo child or future thoughts. The support molding was made of some soap operas, decent talents and the characters were drawn to resemble the voice actors as well. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. I consider this during Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula, but liked the smarter script better than I enjoyed Subzero. 10.7
