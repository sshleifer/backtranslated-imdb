This was the best documentary I have ever seen !! I just saw Lord of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta and was surprised and pleased to find out that this was also one of his films. Great Job Stacy! I kicked back to work last week, bored O * & ^% less, and this movie came on. Growing up in Orange County in the 80s, I surfed up and down the local beaches, and so did my father when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I was body body, boogeyboarded and moved from there. This movie just fascinated me. It was way before my time, but it was great to see what these guys were going through. TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collector's item.
