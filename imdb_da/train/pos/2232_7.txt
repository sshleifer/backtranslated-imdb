I saw it when I was 17 and haven't seen it since. 'CBS Late Movie' used to show it regularly at some point. I remember how sad and disturbing it was, it made me really sick in my stomach. So, the effects were not what they are today, yet they left the feeling of being alone in the Amazon after losing both parents and looking for a way out. I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her meat. It's a dark movie that was controversial at that time, though it was probably heavily edited for television. I want to remember more details, and if I ever get the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I think it may have been shown on CBS during another title. I have no idea if it was ever released on video.
