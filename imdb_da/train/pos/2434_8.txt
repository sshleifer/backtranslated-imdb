I have often wondered how much CASPER was meant for children ... with all the problems that were about his identity (in this movie we believe he is the spirit of a dead child when his home is a cemetery), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular movie. Perhaps Casper was meant more as a moral game, or Famous Studios felt like breaking new ground into 'reality' cartoons. <br /> <br /> IT'S GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well animated project - no doubt there. But the plot development involving the fox (which becomes Casper's friend but meets a tragic end) is a concern. Give famous Studios credit - they tackle death with respect ... but the strong picture of Casper's grief is pretty graphic and disruptive to children (though the detoument gives a happy ending, but I don't want to end) and the violence is pretty steep, even for the 1940's standards. <br /> <br /> This can be a great cartoon for parents to help explain the death to children - but I wouldn't pop it into the VCR for a perky cartoon break.
