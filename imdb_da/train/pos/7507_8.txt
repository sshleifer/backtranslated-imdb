Greetings again from the dark. Mary Heron brings together the list of films that give a glimpse into their specific era. Her former "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when commenting on the community's quirkiness during that period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Ms. Page, it's just as much a top behind the curtain in the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50s. The film is fun to see from the perspective of history and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W movie and pictures capture the time, and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the images of Bunny Yeager is very well done. <br /> <br /> The support molding is strong with David Strathairn (fresh from his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (like Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underhanded Gretchen Mol. Mrs Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was quite fascinating in that little bit, Jason Alexander instructed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the infamous Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underground pin-up queen. As you might expect, the soundtrack from the era is fantastic. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured artists. Although the film suggests giving a story to this industry, the last third kinda falls flat and prevents pure film magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes it a fun movie to watch and one that will give endless shows on HBO in the near future. Now someone will please turn Ms. Mol into the star, she should be?
