This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a very low budget it was done well; Of course, I can be sympathetic to the protagonist, although my sleeping problems have never been so intense or disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well-directed, well-acted, on a topic that I haven't seen much in theaters, lighting and both perfectly suited to the movie setting. There are few noticeable goofs, but they can be calculated; You will see after you have watched the movie. The movie is very personal and worth watching twice. No movie is flawless, but a Hollywood version couldn't make the story better. All in all, 8/10.
