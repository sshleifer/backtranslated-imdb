If you're used to watching Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in the usual suspects, I recommend you look at this movie. Although you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors in this movie give really good performances. If you have about eleven bucks (that's close to nine quid) I say order it online or rent it from your favorite movie rental site. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you are normally similar to gangster type movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of the movies you never forget and finds yourself looking again and again. You will talk about it so much that your friends will beg to borrow it.
