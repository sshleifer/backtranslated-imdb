This should be one of my favorite flicks, unlike the weak "Elvira's Haunted Hills" ... yet I love the way the movie is a goth / com 'Wizard of Oz' story ... <br /> <br /> Elvira is a goth Dorothy, stranded in an unknown city after the death of a good witch (Elvira's Aunt Morgana) ... she inherits a "Ruby" ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by Bad Warlock (Her Uncle). She is friendly with four characters, which she accidentally helps grow throughout the movie with a dog in tow. There is a show with her uncle (the western evil witch) where Elvira realizes she has the strength in her and ends up defeating him. Eventually she is sent out of the city's folk music after winning over their hearts and finally coming to her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). There are many references to the wizard oz throughout the movie ... she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus .... There's no place like home, there's no place like home!" Poor Uncle Vinny: "I'll get you my beautiful and your little dog too!" There is a sign that Elvira is passing when she is on her way to the state of Kansas. <Br /> <br /> But apart from this, the fact that one of the sequences she "ripped off, um ... I mean was inspired by FlashDance" is pure genius ... and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her "very 80's" Las Vegas show so you haven't got a camp leg in your body ... This movie is a Cult / Camp Classic
