American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the plane to the US. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they first met, they spoke like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to accompany him to take a tour of Vienna. Then the romantic story broke out. <br /> <br /> First, they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They looked at each other even though their eyes did not contact. After a profound conversation, the relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene they promised to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other was expressed entirely by words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it won't come as you want. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important thing for love. Excellent script and performance resulted in great success in the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best romance films. 9.10
