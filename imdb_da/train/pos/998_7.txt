This is a really interesting movie. It's an action movie with comedy mixed in. Foxx quit comedian Epps in this movie to give it a comic spin. It will keep you wondering what's going to happen to Foxx next. It was a well-shot movie, the director used the right colors in this movie (dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feeling. Kimberly Elise was also in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing, you haven't seen it. It is definitely worth having if you are a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it actually is.
