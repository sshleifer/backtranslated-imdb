Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you don't have any of these, you can't understand it. And if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is a name for a car produced by Citroen, probably if you see a Picasso's painting, you will just go past it and decide that it is a galeries garbage can. :) So don't judge before you try to understand it :) Finally, I think it's a MUST for everyone with open mind. Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be framed. Because there are things in this world, every frame just won't fit.
