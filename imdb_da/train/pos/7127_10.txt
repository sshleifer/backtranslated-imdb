Marvelous film again deals with trials and tribulations in World War II England. What makes this movie as good is the human element. It is certainly the tradition of such British classics as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As is the case with this movie, we see desperation of people in wartime. <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent here especially by the cursed John Thaw, who is awarded a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing. <br /> <br /> We quickly see why this kid is betting his bed. He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly. The old one goes to the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks him only to find tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it acts and builds on inviting conditions.
