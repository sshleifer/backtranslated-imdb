Carlos Mencia was excellent this is hours special. He worked hard to show everyone that he was the right deal. I know people have said he's stolen material in this particular, but that's not true. Carlos brings up comedy the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, that's why he's so good. People say he is not funny because he says that he is too much, and they still have not understood what is part of his action and they do not want it that way, but he does bring it anyway and succeed in making people laugh. For all the hates out there, here's a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring him down.
