I loved the episode, but I think there should have been a quick reference to the secretary being punished for being effectively accomplice to that fact. While I like when an episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this, its dissolution must be included in the end of the episode along with the uncovered of the killer. The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous author, gives some comments about being flattered by the famous Lt. Columbo, who makes a heavy-in-cheek adherence to the detective's real life fame as a crime solver. This is one of the best of many good Columbo installments.
