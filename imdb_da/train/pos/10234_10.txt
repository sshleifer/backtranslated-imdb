<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of the neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lamb's urban cynicism. When you watch the movie, they can feel the battle scenes are only mediocre in nature, but that doesn't matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. This amazing movie has both !! Lam always supplies traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" setting. But these are not the light hearted comic incarnations that you might see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys fight to death with brutal results. What makes the movie even better is that someone could die at any time, there is no restraint. Too bad, they don't make movies like this more often.
