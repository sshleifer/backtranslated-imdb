Everything was better in the last few days. Even children's TV. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing this comment, I'm fourteen years old, but even in my teens, I can't resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who have actually lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a horde of playful and stupid creatures called Fraggles who live - amazingly - in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The stone is inhabited by many other species such as the hard-working Doozers and countless living plants. Outside the cliff on the one hand invents inventor Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later turns to Gobo Fraggle), on the other hand, a family of Gorgs-supposed ruler of the universe. The five most important Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and a friend of Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic homemaker) and Red (love something to do with sports and general feud) are caught up in Some strange situations each episode while simultaneously singing and dancing their worries away. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well, but the song and dance routines will keep their attention. The characters are strong and sympathetic, their conflicts trustworthy and their adventures exciting. Gorgs are scary, Doc and Sprocket enlightening, Uncle Traveling Matt fun (postcard segments are very 80s!) And the last episode, Change of Address, really touching. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!
