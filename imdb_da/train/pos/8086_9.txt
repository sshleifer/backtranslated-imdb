I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after seeing the amazing Live Live version of the movie in 2001. The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be far better than George Lucas' Star Wars' prequel "trilogy (episodes 1-3) ever become like the true fantasy film series of the 21st century! <Br> <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child and I didn't quite understand the depth of Now that I've read the books, I understand what the whole story is about. Of course, some of the characters are pretty stupid (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)) But I have to say that it follows the book quite closely, and it goes into part of book two, The Two Towers, the good thing is that the action is something interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for the time being, the bad things e r that it ends up halfway through The Two Towers without any result of Frodo's attempt to destroy one ring, and the animation looks quite dated to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not as bad as many say it is. MEN 2001 version is the new feature of the Lord of the Rings! At least, Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn made him create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter! I take the animated version of Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter anyday! A 7 out of a scale from 1-10, much less violent than the live version from 2001, but NUHVER nearly as good! To diehard fans of the books and film versions of the Lord of the Rings.
