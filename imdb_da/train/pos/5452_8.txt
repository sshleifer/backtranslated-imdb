A pre-code stunner with Stanwyck plays a speakeasy whore who sleeps his way to the top. These pre-code flicks let everything go with nothing back to the imagination. Stanwyck is excellent as Lilly's daughter of a speakeasy owner / father who sold more than booze to his patrons (johns). After the old man dies (well!) Barb leads to the big city for better things. She uses her female attributes to sleep her to the top. John Wayne makes a bad "cameo" and proves that the actors are getting better with age and a working coach. I loved the junkies and the strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie buffs and to watch Stanwyck, who is amazing and beautiful as Lilly.
