I don't think it was a play challenge for Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated plot, but interesting. It's a good movie to watch when you don't want to think much, just want to be told a simple story. The Canadian landscape was breathtaking. The beautiful Fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing.
