This film is a journey through a screenwriter's thoughts captured in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the ever-illusive question of "who am I" and "what am I?" It is a brave and thought-provoking company. There is a shipload of beautiful images, dream-inspired, Escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the drawing itself, or rather to delete itself. More and more, we follow the author in his pain over what to say and what to film, we see him calling his wife who left Peru, leaving him to take care of their baby, a task he does less and less attention until he is so absorbed in his dilemma that he hardly sees the child any more. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him cross the last tree until he deletes himself. Interspersed with eye-sensing and I-destructive images, the story is essentially philosophical. It's about Maya's veil, the world of illusion. The paradox of paradox, however, is that it requires a lot of speeches and thinking to prove that the mindset should stop. During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophy, the film made me long for silence or a shorter movie. If that was the purpose of the spouse, he managed quite well.
