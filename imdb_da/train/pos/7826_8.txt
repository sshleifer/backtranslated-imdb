Picture like the story of Steve Biko - the game excellent by Denzel Washington as you would expect - this was actually more the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> It was undoubtedly made by Kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the role. Attenborough gave it the kind of direction you could expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the kind that only he can come across. The rest of the throw was competent enough and did a good job, ending up as an ultimate sad story of a South Africa that is still not near the distant past.
