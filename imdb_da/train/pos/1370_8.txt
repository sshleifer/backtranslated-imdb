I remember seeing years ago when it first came out, and I became the floor of Parker Posey's performance. And the film was also quite good. For anyone who has spent too much time in the nightclub / after-hours scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, mostly fun, and Parker Posey definitely blows his talented way through this indie gem. I especially liked the Diaz character (reminded me of every struggling DJ I've ever known). And many other movies could take a cue from this movie about how to preach virtue for responsibility without being boring and bland over it. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
