I don't think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle, and I thought it was so much fun. I haven't laughed so hard during a movie for a long time. I thought the whole cast did a good job. You will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very first scene. I suppose some movie guests (especially those who take WAY too seriously) are being turned off with this humorous brand. Not me. The movie was a real surprise. And the whole theater rolled with laughter through the show I went to, which makes me think that many people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time in the movie for a change. I can't wait to see it again! If you're in the mood for LOL, it's for you. Fun fun fun fun!
