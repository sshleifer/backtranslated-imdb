The real story (took place in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two ex-prisoners who broke into a distant house on a rainy night to steal and kill all those met). Richard Brooks instructed the chill and disturbed Capote's book on the reasons why these children were driving the crime (are they natural born kittens?). The crime scenes are very brutal and haunting due to lack of senses and reasons for what we experienced. Stunning black and white film from Conrand Hall, excellent country-road music score from Quincy Jones, amazing performances in two leading roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and the first time in a movie a sad commentary on the death penalty in the last few moments before their death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as instructor and author of custom manuscript) are nominated for the Academy Award. Gripping, excellently directed and scary, one of the best films of this decade
