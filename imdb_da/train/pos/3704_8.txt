Generally, it is difficult to evaluate these cut-and-paste films. Some of the segments may be quite good while others reduce the rating of the overall product. For example, in this one, the all-girl scene in the doctor's office was quite exciting ... one of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing history. Then there is Asia's segment ... the lady is always entertaining. And the story that binds all together was an interesting concept. The switching scene that closes out the offer is also not bad. Technically, the production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
