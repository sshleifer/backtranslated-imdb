I saw this little Belgian gem two days after seeing 'American Teen'. Don't make a mistake, teen years are a roller coaster ride, be it American or European. 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or as it is called in the United States 'Water Lillies') is a tale of a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who at times looks like a young Scarlett Johansson) works the cool, withdrawn girl, who wants to be at school swimming, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It's more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane. The figure among all this is Mary's pretty plump, uninteresting friend, Anne, who just wants a girlfriend like any other girl's age. Along the way, we show the usual selection of teenage hours (broken hearts, store lift, alcohol and / or drug use, leisure sickness, etc.). This is a quiet little movie that takes time to work, it goes into your system (Michael Bay fans, note: pacing here is slow, so steer clear), but if you have no problem with this, Water Lillies is and charm. No rating here, but will draw a hard "R" due to language, nudity, adult situations.
