The "tenant" is Roman Polanski's largest film IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this one is so much more original and unconventional and even scary. It is also a great black comedy. Some people I've shown this movie have been * very upset * of it afterwards, so be aware it affects some people that way. Polanski does a good job as a leader in the "Tenant" as well as managing it.
