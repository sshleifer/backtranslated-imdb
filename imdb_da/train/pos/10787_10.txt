So when I was a kid, I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. we wanted to see it all the time. When our friends came over, we would have sleeps and we would see great rock candy mountain and grandfather's magic toys. I am 21 now, and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently came together and watched it, we knew all the songs, and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. A friend actually bought this movie and her grandfather's magic toy for her 2-year-old daughter, because she wants to pass on our love to this movie. This is really a movie you can let your kids see and feel safe, no violence, not bad language, just lots of good songs and important lessons.
