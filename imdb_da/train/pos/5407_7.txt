I've always had the Pokemon movies. Yes, I know everyone is very grainy, mediocre in some specific areas and safe, even though they are aimed at young children, they are for adults in some fields to keep them with the statement "Hey, light up, it's a children's movies, "but all that is present, are they not still good entertainment types? In my opinion, they are so, and I enjoy them a lot. This one is as entertaining as the previous three, and certainly cooler. It has some really sweet and touching moments, as it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh Pokemon Celebi. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third installment, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. This film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially about climax / ending, like all repayments, and the characters, while slightly weaker than the previous three, I still thought are cozy and humorous. These films are the lowest rated and most criticized by the four feature-length adjustments, and it does not deserve it.
