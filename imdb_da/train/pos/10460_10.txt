This was a good movie with a strong message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the consequences of the terrible disease on the family. Well behaved and well run. If there were errors, I should say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds? I would love to see a movie where all these cultures are shown - as in real life. Nevertheless, the film rose in terms of its values ​​and its understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker. Loved the movie and it took tears in my eyes
