It is a story that could have taken place anywhere, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer catch the attention of famous opera star and friendship of it. The aging entertainer finds / buys a male child to pass on his art to. From there we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river. Travel the city to the city he performs and has some degree of infamy. Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances are very first, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays street artist. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and straightforward and resists the obvious prejudices well. The two main characters, along with the support of that kind of opera singer, master Liang (an interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang) paints a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sorrow and love. Some have mentioned the remoteness of this movie with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); But this movie cannot stand alone, an equality is at best. <br /> <br /> My only qualm with KING OF MASKS is the end. It was weak, clich√© and as weird as a sledgehammer. The audience was already wrapped up in history, what was the superfluous manipulation for? What a shame. To bring a fine film picture so far, only to surrender to emotional (and corny) pathos such. It honestly did this movie good, instead of the classic it should have been. On the other hand, KING OF MASKS is still very much worth your time. I was glad to see the Shaw Brothers still producing good movies. Highly recommended.
