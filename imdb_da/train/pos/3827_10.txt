I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong fight for Byron, Claire is young and a bit annoying, Polidori is a convincingly beaten sycophant ... everyone is beautiful, curious and decadent ... not the scary wrecks, they are Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic acts as an independent piece of shock movie, and I loved it for various reasons, but it works like a commercial and ivory movie, and from my reading was the best capture of what summer should have felt . Romantic, yes, but reviving my interest in Shelley's and Byron's life every time I think of the movie. One of my all-time favorites.
