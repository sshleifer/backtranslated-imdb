Broadway and movie actor-turned director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby) create a masterpiece with this 1977 movie. It's the stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavete's self, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there's a como by Peter Falk. The premise of the movie: An aging stage and movie actress (Gena Rowlands) reconsider her life after an unmanned fan die in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The film has a low tempo and a dark, moody, scary quality. It has a 60's biographical look, and it even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fear here is the one every successful actress has - she gets old and she becomes useless in her career. In addition, she feels that she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity, and merit. She has only lived for her career - she has no children, does not do charitable works, etc. The gradual degradation of her personality is meat in this movie. She falls apart. She's in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and seems to be quite good. She is a great actress, and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and / or disaster films or adventure players. It is a film with lots of deep-seated emotions, but has a cold, cynical feel, as if Cassavetes criticized the regular films and actors of the 70's. Whether it or this film is a product of the 70s, which in itself was cynical in many aspects - Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not large and this film is not known, it is a very ghost movie with joking moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80s.
