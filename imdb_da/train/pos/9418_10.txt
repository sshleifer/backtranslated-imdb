I've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry --- so ironic!) Mostly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's title music again. I ended up sitting through the first half hour, entranced by how wonderfully secured the direction, writing and performances are. The movie is like one who is 50-year-old British character stars: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, who is great as the textile's favorite old giant. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not character players as such, but charming, charismatic leads. This is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well. A full-time classic, and I hope no one ever tries to recreate it!
