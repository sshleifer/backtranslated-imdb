I am a big fan of movies where people get confused and the House of Games is almost the top of the "movies where people get boring" genre. In short, it's an extraordinary thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by giving interesting characters on many levels and never revealing what's happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to completely disturb you just seen. The film goes against the audience on many occasions, and despite us this knew; It is still hard to guess where it goes and every twist comes out as a surprise. As mentioned, I am a big fan of disadvantages in movies, and the plot of this follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a large debt owed to a fellow. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help her patient, and on the way is drawn into the art of reading people to retire. <br /> <br /> The House of Games breathes all the time, and David Mamet does well to set up his movie setting at the city's underground levels. The film is also suitable, with anyone interested in bringing life and belief in their characters with the greatest skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the royal man in the heart of the movie, and although his performance is a little underhanded, he is always solid and credible as the villain of the play. Lindsay Crouse stars with him as a psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is credible in his role. She may not be the biggest looking, but at least she can act. The way the film performs its plot, however, is the main star, and you will no doubt be surprised at several times how the film constantly cuts to wonder and deceive the viewer. At times it is almost as if we are in the thickness of the action and are being fooled by the royal men in the film. Another thing that is great for this movie is the way it shows the audience how to draw certain disadvantages, which is useful if you are interested in earning 20 bucks, say. All in all, the House of Games is a truly first-class exciting trip.
