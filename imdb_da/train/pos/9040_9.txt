A really healthy American story of teens interested in launching their own rocket in a rural area in West Virginia coal mining town after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Through trials, tribulations and perseverance that are not convinced they are ultimately able to reach their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, head of the group, is excellent in the title role. As her motivational science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good, but her southern accent is over the top. <br /> <br /> There is a standout-supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a main miner who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity at all. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done. <br /> <br /> In addition to the science angle, we have father-son disagreement, soccer scholarships as a way to escape coal mining and the family's loving spirit. <br /> <br /> Why are images like this not recognized at award times?
