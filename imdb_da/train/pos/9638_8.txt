This movie was more a passage in manhood for a gay man and how to handle everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister accepts something. The relationship looks great with his boyfriend / exhooker, and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy turns on him and says it doesn't really matter. Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves, dumping his new lover and starting over. We are back with him and start and see, not participate in happiness. So maybe it will be better for him in the future. The end was a kind of downer, but the whole movie was completely realistic, and then I let this real end slip with a high rating.
