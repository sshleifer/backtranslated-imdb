An original uncensored print of this amazing movie was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress and has been featured in a few specialty theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews I have found online, the original has all the nastiest dialogue and innuendos intact; They were later either removed or completely resumed by the studio before the first release in order to pass the New York State Censors. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! If we are lucky, it will contain comparisons between the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck rules!
