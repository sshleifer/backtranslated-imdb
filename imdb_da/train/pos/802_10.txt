I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was fantastic. I love when a movie ends with a wonderfully dark nature, but this time I was impressed that Darth Vader turned to the emperor. I was really surprised. The repentant sequence in that movie was when Luke was tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. He is being destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, removes his dark master. A lovely sacrifice. The movie of this movie is impressive. I was surprised at all the vessels in the Rebel Battle ships and all the Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on the screen Mon Calomari, ewoks, the sullesteen (Lando's co pilot) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in that movie: 1 - When the Danger destroys the emperor and is badly hurt. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda then it shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the largest scene in Star Wars). 3 - When LEia beats Jabba out to choke the Hutt crime master. <br /> <br /> I personally like the script and battle of Endor presenting a ground and space battle as well as the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader's Luke Skywalker on Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in slave bikini are memorable. 10.9.
