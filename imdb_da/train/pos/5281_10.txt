This is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise', but it is a fine road movie. It carefully and easily sets up its two main characters. viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly, which is a tribute to the director. There is the young French (and English) speaking son who will do well in France, have a French girlfriend and drink alcohol, parties like young men do. And there is his Moroccan Arab (and French) speaking father, who devotedly follows his Muslim faith with generosity and the wisdom of the elderly, and rejects the new culture around him (as mobile phones). the film could explore very powerful politics - the weird couple running through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then through the Middle East to get to Mecca. these are areas where Muslim populations have been involved in wars, oppression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant lethal struggle with each other. But the movie moves through these sites and opportunities with only hints on such agendas. The relationship between the two is the key to this movie, and believe that politics is the background. It seems to say that we are all human, and need to understand and care for each other to do well in this world. It is certainly not 'Natural Born Killers' and is better for it.
