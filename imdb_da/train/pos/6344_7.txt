I'm overwhelmed by Jim Carrey's work. I keep getting this movie stuck in my head. The Grinch smiles Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, her sweet innocence), trying to get Grinch in Christmas spirit, Grinch's childhood (a lot of fun!), And besides, the faint obvious end to Christmas isn't all about gifts . I have to say, I felt stupid to go out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so on, but this movie was a good full-length adaptation of Dr.Seus's short film and IS for all ages.
