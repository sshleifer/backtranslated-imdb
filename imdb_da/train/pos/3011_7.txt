One of the better Vance movies succeeds more in the interesting plot and artistic direction of none other than Michael Curtiz. This time, a general hated financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked and bolted bedroom on the top floor. Philo Vance, who hears about the situation while he is leaving for Italy, decides to end his holiday and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering suicide. William Powell is just as gracious a Philo Vance as you will find. He never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does. Powell is assisted by a number of very talented actors - some top character actors and actresses such as Mary Astor as a niece who hated his uncle, Ralph Morgan as the death exam, Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog friend, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as the The next door held blond and two really good performances by James Lee as the Chinese chef and portly Eugene Palette as a clever crackling policeman. Add the mixture a wonderful comedy turn of Etienne Girardot as a public writer always lacks his meal. It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many blemishes that make The Kennel Murder Case a fast and fun mystery.
