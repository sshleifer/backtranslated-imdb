<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. Etched in my memory of never leaving me is a scene in which Mickey Rooney - "Killer Mears" knows he must be performing and approaching the moment of truth; . Never have I seen such a brilliant performance by any actor who lives or is dead, past or present. That is when I know Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is an actor of great genius. But I kept it, my opinion to myself for years thinking, I must surely be alone in this point of view. About 15 years or so after I watched this movie for the last time on television, I was able to read the old Q&A section of the Los Angeles Times. The question was put to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier You are considered one of the greatest actors from all the time, who do you mean to be among the greatest actors?" His answer was "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned but not surprised. I instantly flashed back to his "Killer Mears" and I felt very good at seeing this great ability in him, and now my vision has been supported by someone else I admired. Later there was Bill himself and many other great moments with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile", is to be seen by all acting students. I honestly can't remember much about the movie after all these years, but Mr Rooney in it will never leave me. If someone in there remembers this movie the same as I do? I would be interested to hear from you. For this image etched in my heart alone, I gave it a 10 right on his performance page.
