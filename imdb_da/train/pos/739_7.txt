I have been a fan of Jodie Foster ever since we were both children, from her Disney year. I loved her tomboy antics in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was a great departure from all that. <br /> <br /> Where other young female actors in that era were spoiled for sexual leverage as comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?) Jodie went to a depressing and tragic tale of teens drawn to their death by the powerful temptation of temptation and addiction. <br /> <br /> This wasn't Disney. This was not Porky's. This was not "Halloweed". This was a dark and strong story of the destruction of young life. Unfortunately, it is a narrative that is still played daily throughout the country. This movie can be played (with a current audio track) and still be completely relevant. It's not the best movie ever made, it's tired of some parts, not all performances are extremely excellent. But Jodie Foster continued to show her chops as a true adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Barky
