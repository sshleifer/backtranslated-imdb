Beautiful movie, pure Cassavete's style. Gena Rowland gives a fantastic performance of a falling actress dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts covered by a young girl's death sentence. Acceptance by itself, of human condition, although its overall difficulties are the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself is marvelous: it is as if the scene became a way for heroin. If all American films could only be the best quality dealing with human relationships at an adult level, try not to infantilize and standardize emotions ... One of the best dramas ever. 10/10.
