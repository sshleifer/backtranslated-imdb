Don't be hovered by the naysayers. This is a wonderful scary movie. This was a dissertation project for the author / director, JT Petty. He did a good job of having me on the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect and it was a Nirvana for a scared horror movie goer! The film relates to an elderly man living in an isolated log cabin in the forest. One day, looking for his cat in the woods, does he witness the murder of a child, or does he? He is agonizing here the rest of the movie. What is most unusual about this movie is that there is no dialogue until the last few scenes. I found this to be exciting. The author manages to grab your senses and give them a relentless tugboat. Give this movie a ride, you won't be disappointed.
