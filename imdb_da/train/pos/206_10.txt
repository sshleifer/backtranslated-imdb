I'm 14, so you probably think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone as such. Boy are you wrong. I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar for it. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and loved it. This one was also very fantastic. George Burns did a good job. It also did Walter Matthau (that's the first time I've ever seen him). And even though they had really little roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. The special thing they filmed would have been great if it really was done. Let me say this if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should watch this movie right away!
