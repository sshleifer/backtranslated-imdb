This is simply a classic movie where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they are thoughts. I don't know if my video copy lacks a scene, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the cave. It also shows an animal's survival instinct and tracing abilities. But people in the same position would be helicopters out. Once, an original movie is improved with a remake as the voice-over to the first one has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because the use of people would have had to spice up the story by making it murder and proving that after all, the animals are more interesting than humans
