The first von Trier movie I've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure of a good movie, but it certainly stands in the shadow of europe. Europe tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after World War II. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels all the time through an almost completely destroyed Germany, meeting with the killing of traitors and hunting for former Nazi party members. Society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his consciousness by focusing on the job he also has as a purser on the train. Randomly, the protagonist gets involved in the bombing and terrorism of a group called "wolves", putting pressure on him to help them place bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man who tries to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counts to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
