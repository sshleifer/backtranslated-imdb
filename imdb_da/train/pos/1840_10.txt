Great manuscript and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the concept of "lone wolf" police engineer a whole new dimension of intensity and most important credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood cop-heroe loses family, friends, and pets to murder, he's usually given his minute of grief. But when the 60 seconds are over, he pulls himself together, packs the gun and looks forward to shooting his enemies one by one. Montand's Marc Ferrot, however, is really destroyed - by her boyfriends murder, of course, but also by finding out that she had another lover. In his confusion and anger, he does not revenge, but must continue to find the real perpetrator for a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene. Thus, all his actions become inevitably logical. This is the main reason why this film glues us to our seats, but certainly not the only one.
