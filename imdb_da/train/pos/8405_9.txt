I'm proud to say that I own an indescribable copy of this selection piece of the 70's Crown International drive-in sexploitation comedy cheese on DVD. It's a really greasy and comfortable inconsequential flick with a nice breezy'n'easy 70's vibe to it. It tries to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail. Sure, it's essentially a blatant young male fantasy pic - head teen goofus character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, respect for his friends and a chance to show up a local van-racing pile - but it's too deaf and good-natured to hate. Stuart Getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead, Deborah White as the main content of Getz's love is a particular girlfriend, Connie Lisa Marie is also quite delicious as a beauteous blonde treasure and creeping beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (a 60-biker movie perennial ) is wonderfully hateful as the brutal Dugan Hicks. A pre-stardom Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute rebellion like Getz's sharp carwash owner boss Andy, a lovably cantankerous ne'er-do-well slob who wears very ugly high Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit. I especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny up - you hold your arms behind your back while the other guy works over Danny's torso! And Sammy Johns' scary catchy fluke hit theme song will jump around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's great groovy retro-70s fun!
