Man On Fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem that accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. At first, he is not friendly, but then they turn to each other, he decides to stop drinking, etc. Etc. ... one day she is kidnapped ... and killed ... And <br /> And he won't stop anything to get revenge. It's basically the story of Man On Fire, but expect some great twists at least a couple of times, including the end, which is beautiful and will probably make you too. It's also because of the amazing music Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed. <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... The thing is, everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First of all. Denzel Washington is in his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always, good Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... Then came cinematography, which is dazzling and with great editing, should have won an Oscar for sure. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge movie. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think ... and is clean, beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you should see in your lifetime at least once!
