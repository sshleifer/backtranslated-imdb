Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> The best Star Wars ever. It's the first movie I ever saw, the bad wins and it's a very good ending. It really made me wait for the next star war because there are so many things in this movie that you just had to find out in the last. whit Many movies I always get the feeling that it could be don bedding, but not with this. and I will never forget the part was wading count Luke he is his father. Too cool. also loves Bob feat figure one makes hes a back ground player. If you have never seen a Star Wars movie you go to this one.its the best. <br /> <br /> thanks Lucas
