Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India are deployed to stop a rebellion of a tribe of murderers known as Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by Thuggees led by the eerie Guru. Swing Din, the water boy of the regiment, goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but are also trapped. Now the protagonist sends out a detailed look for the three, but does not realize that they are entering a trap set by their home. However, it is Gunga Din who saves the day. Excellently made buddy, although today it is politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very humorous and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very scary as Guru. Rating 10 out of 10.
