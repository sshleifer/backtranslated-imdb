I stumbled upon the rerun syndication of this show several years ago and fell in love with it. It has TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and kept me laughing, an episode after the next. I think it didn't make it so big and was canceled after some seasons, but I think it was a good run and would suggest seeing it ... if the opportunity arises.
