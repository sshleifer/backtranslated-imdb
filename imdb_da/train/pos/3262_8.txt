I don't think I could have been more, though some things were disturbing. I don't want to say what if you haven't seen it ... find out for yourself. Which movie can at least be lacking with Robert Downey Jr's whale dog eyes? All in all, the plot was sufficiently developed. Nothing seemed rushed like movies like this tend to be. The characters were like-able, and there were lots of fun scenes in it. The idea at all is that the story is very well tied together, although some aspects may be unsatisfactory ... by a matter of meaning. But as I said before, it is hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
