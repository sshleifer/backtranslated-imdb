I love this movie, and it's a wonderful example of a family risk, a romantic love story, and a very sad story story. Everything was just as perfect and great for this movie. It was a great mix of actors and actresses, and with some laughs and screams, this movie deserves a lot of prizes. With mention of a beautiful scenario, and although I would relate this movie to The Notebook and The Family Stone, it was so much more cunning, sad and brilliant than these movies. The evening tells of a love story between an old woman who dreams back to her younger years, and her two daughters remain on her side while she is not happy. The story that dates back is so much told and wonderfully I sat on the edge of my seat. You really learn all the characters, and at the end I would see it all again. This is an incredibly sad and lively act and plot movie that is truly one of a kind and should be seen by everyone for how wonderful it really is. All performances are amazing, and the film captures your attention from the beginning and never lets go. I loved it and am so happy that I saw it because it was truly an amazing movie ...
