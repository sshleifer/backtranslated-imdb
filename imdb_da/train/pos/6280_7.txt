If you like cars, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some amazing actors in the movie, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical no-nonsense attitude and hardcase look. The others are also not bad .... <br /> <br /> There are only two minor flaws in this movie. First, the poor plot, but people do not see this movie to the plot. Secondly, the domination of large-scale car (car crime). But if people really think they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it so well look at them, you hope to be in jail! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was going to act, I thought first "... the swee." but then I thought "... so you suck!" but then finally after watching the movie I realized "... he is sugar!" Only fun he plays very well. I end this unusual review by saying "If the premature death of a criminal has somehow informed the general cinema that goes public about the gloomy finish under the shiny veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their paths Then this death brings with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory, everyone must be fortunate. You can say "Bad Criminal." I say, "Bad us." <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks really nice!
