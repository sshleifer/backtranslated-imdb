Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show has been left in Richard Roeper's missing hands. Roeper is not a film critic, he just criticizes something he doesn't like personally, ie. country music music is being panned because "I do not like country music!" and children's movies get a standard "Don't watch it now, wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it to your children!" Roeper may well be an idiot savant, but in another field. The weekly guests 'seated' for Ebert go better, but who will choose a daisies in the middle of a cow pat? All that said, it's the only show in town, and that alone makes it worth seeing. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, you can too! It is your mind and thoughts that we long for. Do everything necessary to get the unsurpassed from his self-enlightened throne.
