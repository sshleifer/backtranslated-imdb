I have to say from the start when I watched the Stargate movie, I was not blown away or anything like it was like an average sci-movie with much potential, even though the film was not like, erm, great as other sci-fi movies as a star wars or aliens, as if you are a sci fi fanatic you will admit that one of the two titles is amazing, although I am not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, I do not remember a line from one of These movies, i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts, in fact if you saw me, i would look like an average person to you, ah get a bit off the point here, well my point is, that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this big series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons without falling in quality as it got closer to its end in 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like the movie, I was very happy to look forward to the first season in 1997, o g let me tell you that the special effects were just one of the brilliant things about the series, chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special influences were so good if not better than most sci fi shows ran today. I must admit that I would never have been to Sci fi if it was not for the stargate and my father actually got me sci fi when I was like 6 and I'm glad he did. I've seen the brilliant shows like SG1, which in my opinion is the benchmark for almost all sci-fi shows and movies, basically if a new sci series is not better or as good as SG1, it's not worth seeing. Basically, this is the best sci fi show to date, and if you don't see this then you have no idea what you're missing!
