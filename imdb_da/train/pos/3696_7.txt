Although I live in Minnesota, I have been studying in France lately and encountered this bizarre gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, at least said. A creative and unique film, the various directors each borrowed something different for their interpretation of love in the city of light. The first instinct is to try to fit each of these little stories into an overall story, much as can be done with 2003's Love Actually. However, this attempt makes the magic of each segment obsolete. When taken at face value, with each of the short segments taken as their own individual movie, the love stories together tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The movie is strikingly bizarre at times - often to the point of confusion - and each segment can be difficult to follow. Still, to a guards who place great emphasis on each of the segments, the short plot lines become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost exciting; It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's coming next. It leaves the viewer wondering "Has it really just happened?" but also leaves them happy that it actually took place. It's the kind of movie where the viewer, by leaving the theater, can't actually decide if they loved it or they hated it. The first reaction is to go and see it over and over just to see these individual lives blended together in a cinematic masterpiece. The interesting decision to make the film multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate. It adds to the reality of the movie - here the American tourists speak English, the Parisian French and so on. The number of people that the film includes leads to an understanding of the international language of love. From illness to supernatural, parenting love of husband's love, this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling. In its beautiful and ornate way, each unique event falls in a way to tell a story: that of all types, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
