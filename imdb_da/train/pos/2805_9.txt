Wow, I can't believe I was waiting so long to watch this movie. I just never came around to see it. The reason has nothing that interests me. I know nothing about football (football.) I am one of those American fools who have no clue. I had never seen David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the buzz around this movie at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> The truth is being told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of film-making heaven. What a fun movie. It is full of color and extent. I had a greasy laugh on my face throughout the film. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can do nothing but mess for her. No wonder why the American TV show E.R has snatched her up. I have a new understanding of the Indian culture. These people know how to feel good. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents. I lit the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I'm sure the audience around the world is having trouble understanding the constantly changing snake of American movies as well. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. It has a great sports plan like Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that allows women. I saw it with my wife and sixteen-year-old niece, and we loved it all. I highly recommend it.
