<br /> <br /> Okay, the movie wasn't going to win any prizes and it's pure bubblegum, and it's a modern update on "It's a wonderful life". But it's just come out as a cheap release on DVD, and there are much worse ways to blow at $ 13. You get a movie that has a surprisingly strong cast, but for most they were still a year or two from becoming B-list friends. But it's an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half, don't think too much about it.
