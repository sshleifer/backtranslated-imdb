An unexpected pleasure that I had not heard of this movie. Shameful as it guarantees to have a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderful human story with a social message told cautiously, though admittedly predictable in its decision. Solidly acted by those responsible. Beautifully photographed with muted colors that float against crying, capturing the film's nostalgic tone. My latest foray in Chinese film (Shower, Road Home, Not a Smaller) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring. China and its people are a fantastic canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" is highly recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in recent Chinese films. <br /> <br />
