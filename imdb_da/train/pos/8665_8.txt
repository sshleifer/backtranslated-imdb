I accidentally intercepted this title with Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro garbage games. But this film has a good stamp on approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there. Stupednous it's not ... satisfying it is! Look at this movie, I couldn't wonder ... how did Sergio Martino not come with this flick? This has its signature over it and drawn by Edwedge Fenech (not as well known as she should be, but she got a good como in Hostel II). Double cross and triple cross underneath and cement this movie from the beginning to the end with Lee Van Cleef's tremendous coolness under pressure from the 1st second. Should this guy go to Italy to finally reach his potential or let the studio system pass this guy through? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, movie guests should try this for size and see if Sergio Leone would have lowered his epic scale down to Once Upon a Time in America for half the operating time (and 1/4 of the budget) that's what , it would have turned out to be like. So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and make it a sofa matin√©e
