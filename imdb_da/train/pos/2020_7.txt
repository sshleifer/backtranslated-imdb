CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I watched an ad for this on a video. Then my sister discovered that we had the book so I read it. I rented the video the same day I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable as was the book. The cast was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was excellent when Helen and Rupert Graves were hateful as Arthur. Costumes, music and settings are amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! DO NOT READ MORE THAT YOU DON'T SEE IT HERE <br /> <br /> At the back there are some sex scenes that have been added and some violence. That's why the video is rated 15. There are some other things that have been thrown in. After the first part, I felt the accuracy went downhill. While the book is better than this, I am glad that I have seen it and would recommend it to people who have read the book, are Bronte fans or as costume dramas (I'm all 3!) As long as you fast forward through the meat scenes. The book is fairly substantiated. Anne Bronte's books do not seem to be as wide or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, which has made it television and film several times. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion was in it, but here they had practiced it all! <br /> <br /> 7
