I gave it an 8 star rating. The story may have been less than 3/4 of the way into the picture, but the performance remained strong throughout. "Honor men" were changed from "Navy Diver" understandably enough. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces is likely to feel that "honor" is an appropriate word for use in the title.
