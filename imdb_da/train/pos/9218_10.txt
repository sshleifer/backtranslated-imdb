First of all, let me say that I wanted to watch this movie for about a year now because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie. In any case, no video stores carried it but low and saw the local library do. I saw it and absolutely loved it. Yes there were Italian stereotypes, but it was done well and fun. It was not degrading in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did a fantastic job. I laughed a lot for sexual humor. All in all, I think this movie is worth seeing if you can find it. It's cute and just fun to watch. I rarely rank movies as a 10, but I give this a 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Go find it and see it!
