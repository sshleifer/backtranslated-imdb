'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not a romance that is at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is getting married to Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him, but he is sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny haven't talked to each other in five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they immediately fall for each other. How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develops is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every set is a pleasure to see, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good, and also oily, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are fantastic. This movie is fun, charming and therefore very entertaining.
