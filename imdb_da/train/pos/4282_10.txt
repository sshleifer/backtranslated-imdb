Excellent sign of the many fun situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. Movie is a great comedy, fun, interesting, unpredictable. Best point in a movie: characters, so humor itself, history and dialogues. Humor has 'inner development', rarely in Serbian films. So that is the consequence of characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. It is also crisp, intelligent and clear. Most of the movies have unfortunately constructed humor (devising a joke and inserting it into a character's mouth) or common situation comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'art immortality' is incorporated into this movie. Little masterpiece, hardly reached.
