If I want to see a porn movie, I prefer to have some kind of plot and a descent dialogue. Behind bedroom doors is one of the few I have encountered with these attributes. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door fades at the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex are concerned. Chelsea Blue (I think Brooke LaVelle) is the choice actress to play that part of the harsh seducer and play the role wonderfully. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie gets a total of 10, just because she is in it. Her partner in the movie, Monique Alexander is a particular girlfriend. The two should do more work together. In this movie, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. It is a shame. She seems like she has more talent to be shared. I like the girl who was the (possible) DA wife next. I forget her name, but she is pretty nice and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It is obvious that there are parts of her bought a paid for. It's okay, but is she finished? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid her performance here would have lost the rating some, except Chelsea's talent and beauty override any negative ones. Overall, this movie is a good one.
