I remember the first time I saw this movie - I worked in the office over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise. But I gradually found myself more and more involved in this movie I had never seen or heard of until I was completely absorbed. A life and death question (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the United States) is lovely, compelling, moody and moving, all in an excellently written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package. It's a classic that really stands right up there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, gone with the wind, the civic can and the fire trucks. WHY has it never received the same public announcement and video store prominence? Fortunately, some experienced critics have posted it on their "Top 100 of all time" lists. There is hope - the 1940's Fantasia was not a hit for the '60s, and the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but hit TV. Buy it - rent it - see it - demand it! You will not be disappointed!
