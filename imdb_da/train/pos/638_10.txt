For anyone who may think that this show is not for them, try it. Network TV has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality-based shows with some often unreal people. This show is a return to family-oriented television, emphasizing learning some lessons, learning about real friends and family, and perhaps even learning about our national pastimes. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in the show industry today and he is completely cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy to the fictional New York Empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out the headline and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch and see. Hopefully it will stick to some seasons, and we can see Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learn and grow.
