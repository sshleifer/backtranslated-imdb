A river runs through It is one of the movies that deserves to be seen in the theater, so the majesty of its movie can really be appreciated. The action is wonderful and unobtrusive, with every gesture and smile and nods that make sense. Brad Pitt gives a brilliant performance, and Tom Skerrit is strong as the preacher father. The movie moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and streams, but it is well worth it in the end.
