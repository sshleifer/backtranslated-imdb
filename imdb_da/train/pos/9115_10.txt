The idea is a very short movie with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer has made a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film I've seen. I rated this movie with the highest possible rating. I also recommend showing it to office managers and business people in any business. What comes out of it is that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to learn from any office that wants to move forward. I hope that the produced will produce another part for this 'idea'. I look forward to seeing the sequence. Once again, Halaqah congratulates the media on producing a top quality and quality film with a lesson in mind.
