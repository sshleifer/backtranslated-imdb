Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked the real Elvis into what happened at the World Fair, is likely to never increase his performance as the king of this biopic hell of slash and shock dear Carpenter. There are times when you feel like you are watching Elvis until something crushes you back to reality ... maybe reminiscent of an unlucky Don Johnson in Elvis and Beauty Queen? All the shows here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's father Bing plays Elvis's father Vernon here, and there is a fine underrated performance from Robert Gray as Elvis's buddy and bodyguards Red West. <br /> <br /> One should look for rock n roll fans.
