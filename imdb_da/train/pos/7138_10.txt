If John Thaw had never played "Morse", "Kavanagh" or starring in "The Sweeney" and other productions, he was remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in "Good Night Tom". <br /> <br /> Superbly supported by his straight star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and a discreet version, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's charming novel is an appropriate memorial to his art. <br /> <br /> When I read this story of an old widow, Norfolk farmer who was to accommodate a young boy from London before and during Blitz, I found a fairly obvious timeline error in it and credit must go to the filmmakers for to correct this error. They must also be welcomed for not oversizing the story and preventing what could have been reversed, quite easily, into a green root. <br /> <br /> If you hold a CD or a video library, then it is so well made for television movies to be an absolute must.
