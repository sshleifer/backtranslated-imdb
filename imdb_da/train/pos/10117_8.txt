The story of a driver, his sheep ranch boss and the boss's daughter is not for everyone, but it is still very exciting. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the scenes we have been told so well through other films from this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I ever saw the excellent Mary Regan, and since then I've been a fan of her. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the movie "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper takes a trip as ranchers who pay a little too much of the wrong kind of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Sharp acted with unforgettable crushing ideas from all its leaders. I first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in America, but believe you, the unexpected version should not be missed.
