A word: suPURRRRb! I don't think I've seen anything like this for a long time on network or cable TV. Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air in the middle of the TV show filled with reality shows and boring re-runs. <br /> <br /> I have to say I had my reservations. On the contrary, the critics were almost unanimous in crying wrongly and downgrading the show. But when half an hour was over (thank you, NBC, for running a commercial free show), I was left with the feeling of immediate love, love at first sight, the true love that one feels in his gut. Everything about this show screamed EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> Graphics in this show were at least as good as finding Nemo and Shrek. No small feat considering these movies took years to be developed. The cast was marvelous. I am in part to John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team was quite on par with John. Special mention: Lisa Kudrow's guest look. She was at the top of the game creating neurotic, pudgy and lovable panda with a Jewish stripe in her. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this show.) Script was fun, with many inside and adult jokes that were sharp but not sticky. A note for all parents: This is NOT for children. This show was never announced as such and there is a reason why it is set to 9:00, not 8:00. So if you want to complain about "inappropriate context", scare the weather. Adults deserve a comedy that is made only for them, and pride of pride is it. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a little confused by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I think "stereotypical" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are flamboyant. Yes, they speak with German accents. But it is in yesterday's news. Give us something new, something fresh, something fun. Putting the old jokes into a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star force" that these guys have. That is fine by me. But please do not dwell on anything that already knows at heart. Hopefully the rest of the show won't play the same old record again and again. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is definitely a Must-See TV. Fun, witty, with some unexpected twists here and there - there hasn't been a comedy so good since Seinfeld. I'm definitely looking forward to the next episode.
