I think Dark Angel is amazing! The first season was excellent and had a good reason. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life but still "saving the world". And being chased by manticore all season, giving the series a little extra spice. The second season, however, suddenly became a little strange to the first. The plot disappeared quite a bit, and the series lost a bit of its charm, mostly because of all the weird "creatures" that appear. Don't make me wrong the second season is good, but with a little too much of "manticores". But they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the final episodes in season 2, where I had many hopes to see more of it. <br /> <br /> So I really want them to start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind this it can't go wrong. So as a conclusion I would say it is a fantastic series, but I still hope for a third season!
