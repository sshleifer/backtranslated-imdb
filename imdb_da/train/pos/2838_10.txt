New York I love you is full of love and power. Not for everyone, but it's a beautiful movie. It's similar to Shia LaBeouf (seen in Transformers, Disturbia, Charlie's Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones and many more), Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, and many more. With a cast cast, this film is undoubtedly brilliant. Many leading board members around the world have failed to impress. The diversity from one story to another is creative and unique. It's safe to say that New York In Love You is a popcorn movie and should be seen on a big TV! This time, you have confidence in the IMDb class because it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Shanghai, I love you in 2010. See NY ILY, you will not be disappointed.
