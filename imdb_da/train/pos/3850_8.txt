This is the last Dutch language film, Paul Verhoeven, which was made before continuing to make mainstream Hollywood films "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall" among others. He sets the scene by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey online before meeting Gerard Reve, an annoying self-centered author with a morbid imagination. Gerard has been invited to be the guest's speaker at a literary club meeting in the sea town an hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven gives us a glimpse of how Gerard's imagination twists reality. Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity, he admits when he reads the newspaper "and it says 'boom' I read 'stupid' when it says 'flood', I read 'blood' when it says 'red' I sees' death. '' When he tells a story enough times, he begins to believe it; "I lie the truth." He accepts an offer to be the cashier of the club cashier, a beautiful wealthy salon owner. teach her husband to die, he begins to imagine that she is "a black widow." Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess? This is a psychological drama and in telling which of these old movie stuck in my memory, i figured out that i am my favorite wife, looking at his work, it seems to be Paul Verhoeven, and he is a master of questioning our own understanding of reality It's a nice change in the pace of the usual Hollywoo d fare, I saw it in 1983, and it's a movie "stuck".
