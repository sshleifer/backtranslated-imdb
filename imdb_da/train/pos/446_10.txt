One of my favorite film ever, ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotions, humor, humor, intelligence. The story grows, like the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> Casts are also fantastic ..... a huge selection of the finest British talent around. I loved them all for every different element that was brought into the movie. Italy must be one of the most romantic places to create a story like this - everything is about this movie. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
