Paul Reiser did a spectacular job of writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It's worth an Oscar. This was one of this year's most poignant and fun movie. Reiser's wit is amazing and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom "Mad About You". Peter Falk did a masterful job as his father, and Peter, who is now 78 years old, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The support cast was equal to the task, especially the beautiful, beautiful Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must see movie for 2005. We aim for everyone of all ages and religions to love this movie and somehow relate to it. We have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie. We have all had the good and bad times together and want things to be the same, but different.
