This movie stars Jay Leno as Detroit policeman, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo police chief sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit and hoped to sell it to a future car company running by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, the men who were negotiating the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd is trying to refrain from Phillip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd, forcing him to continue their partnership. Meanwhile, in the same rubbish place where the Japanese man had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend had seen the shipyard. <br /> <br /> Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is on robbery, but of course you have to investigate the matter. While Tony is investigating the crime, he runs into the Japanese policeman and he fails him. Eventually they end up on the case. They make a strange couple and there are some really entertaining parts as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a windshield on a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is sympathetic to the role, and Pat Morita is also good. Still, they make one of the more unlikely comrades in an action movie. If you liked friendship movies, cheesy 80s movies or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
