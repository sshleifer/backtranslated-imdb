I usually remove TV movies because of the many ways you know it is TV movie five seconds into the picture. This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-designed atmosphere that was established from the beginning. While the ever-present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (although claimed to be in California, the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver, B.C.), and the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complements Olmos' outstanding acting.
