I knew about this as a similar program like Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and that's the same, only more extreme. Basically, three Welsh guys and a crazy British bloc were gathered for love of skateboarding and a complete disregard for masochistic pleasure to hurt themselves and their health and safety. They have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in prickly needles, naked paintballs, jokes on the smaller guy while sleeping heavily and snoring, stunts at a workplace, eg. Army, cowboys and many more crazy stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting, perhaps not just for themselves. Contributing to Matthew Pritchard, who does pretty much anything, Lee Dainton also up for almost everything, Dan Joyce (the British), who hardly has many physical things and has an OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot but is more popular for being short, bold and lazy. It was number one on the 100 greatest fun moments. Very good!
