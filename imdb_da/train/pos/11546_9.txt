First impression ever: July 21, 2008 <br /> Very impressive manuscript and comedic plays and timing in this movie. Now 40 years old it has not lost its power. Neil Simon shows excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create real comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau provide fantastic comic performances. Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the piece on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Film Editing". Hollywood rarely gives comedies, no matter how good they are.
