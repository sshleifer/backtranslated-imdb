A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and smash Broadway plays about Bessie and Sadie Delany's life, two "colored" sisters who lived over 100 years. They played wonderfully in their age of Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. The feedback and today's scenes do not have as much inspirational value in them as in the book, but are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the sisters' lives, as their mother's intercultural background and the causes of their father's characteristic character, are not clearly presented. You must read the book to fully understand these things. It's just as good because the book is just as great! Apart from these mistakes, it is wonderfully done and done, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
