Yes, commitment. Let's say "Fever pitch" can trick you into believing it's a baseball movie. But no, you don't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the Farrelly Brothers. But of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it even more; with all the references (rather precise ones I want to say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet story; from the curse of the bamboo and everything attributed to it, including the two words you cannot pronounce in front of a fan in Boston: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon depict two people who normally have Other thoughts about entering a relationship: The successful workaholic, who is also wealthy with a school teacher? Thing is, Fallon's character wins Barrymore's heart by being fun, caring, sweet and perfect. But her friends ask her a logical question: if he is such a goalie, why is he still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He has been so engaged in his team ever since his uncle passed his Sox season tickets to him; He has never missed a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And the delicate balance, how much is workaholic willing to abandon his guy's occupation; And how much is the baseball crazed teacher willing to compromise to keep the other love for his life, this is about this movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, you may think that the sports occupation bit of the movie is exaggerated for comic relief. Well, I'm sorry to admit, they're not. Myself, like a die-hard Houston Astros fan, can say they are all true. I would try in every way to access all of Stro's games; Listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet. I read Chronicle's sports department every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, Minute Maid Park's gift shop; with a closet full of Astros gear, including 5 jerseys, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. Fallon's character even has the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was credible enough as the fanatic Red Sox faithful, though he could pull it off without becoming a comic book (God God, Adam Sandler was not in it); and the plot was about how this couple tried to cope with each other's passions. <br /> <br /> I would say it will be a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be among the best movies in history; but definitely breaks a form in the genre and is appealing enough for both men and women.
