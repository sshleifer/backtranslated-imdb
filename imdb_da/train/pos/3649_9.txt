I have seen many television films in my time as a student, most of the normal waste of time that American television throws out. However, this one was well designed and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. After seeing Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate, I was amazed at his excellent performance instead of the right spectrum of A-B expressions he usually gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time dating back to The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can't say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days, but she just managed to do well in her role. All in all, a highly recommended movie.
