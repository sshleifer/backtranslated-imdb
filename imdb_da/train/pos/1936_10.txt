This independent movie was one of the best movies at the high grass movie festival I've ever seen there, I loved it. There are so many things that were good about the movie on top of everything thrown and the crew that I had the opportunity to meet were quite phenomenal. I thought Avi did a good job in her role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true to his role for a Disney actor, I was amazed at his talent for going from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role without any problem the talent in the movie was just amazing, the cinematography was just amazing if you wanted see an independent movie this is a real one that you should see. I think Mr Gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission at his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience's favorite, they went and saw it again. this was really a great movie it was dark and fun and sad and really emotional it was just amazing. I'm honestly as excited about this movie, and I really don't want to spoil it because someone just sees it and gets surprised by it. I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to go places, and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
