This is a great family program with a large selection of actors. It's a nice break from the reality show blitz of lazy. There is nothing else like that on television right now, unless you count Joan of Arcadia as being the same because it also has a teenager's character. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a visit because Jeremy Sumpter gives the protagonist (Pete Young) some kind of equality and naivety that is appealing without being too sweet and fun. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round off the rest of the main cast members, and each is fantastic in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister Betsy; She is a pill, but she still cares about her mother and brother even though she hates showing it. It can take some episodes to really find its legs, but the Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come together for a long time, so check it out people - you'll be glad you did!
