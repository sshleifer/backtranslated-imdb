Now you can either like Mr Carrey's humor or you don't. Me, myself and Irene had the audience both gone into cuddles and on the other hand cheering and collapsing in joy pits. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I watched the movie. If you don't find the sight of a dog that puts the seat down when you've used the fun, don't bother with the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a journalist stuck in a rut that covers 'lighter news' prepares God when his entire life seems to be pot. God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey turns around having all the powers of God by making her boyfriend (Jennifer Aniston) breast bigger, getting promoted and answering everyone's prayers using single-stroke computer commands. <br /> <br /> This is not a highbrow movie or even memorable, but it is very well done within the very limited purpose, giving almost continuous grin to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be unofficial to everyone, but the most narrow-minded god-trainers and anti-god-squadders. <br /> <br /> At the more thoughtful level, the film doubts us about speculating on Carrey's own career - though in his "comedy" typecasting, he has hardly got an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His most accomplished 'straight' role, the Man of the Moon, is less known for his comedy drumming - or The Truman Show (where the Academy posted three nominations while renaming Carrey).
