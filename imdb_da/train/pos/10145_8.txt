This is a really old-fashioned charming movie. The location is fantastic and the situation is one of the old Preston sturgess movies. If you want to see a movie that doesn't require much more than to sit back and relax, it is. The plot is good and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the molding is fun. It's just what happens when two people get married, meet with the one they really love at the weekend, they plan their own weddings. I know ... sounds boiled ... but it is. And it makes fun to see. It will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you, but at least you will know.
