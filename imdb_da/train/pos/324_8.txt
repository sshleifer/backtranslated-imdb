I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I simply got it because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It didn't look very good. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was one of the most wisely composed films of recent memory. It's about a twenty year old woman who wants to know everything. She stores all the information she collects in a huge archive. She is experimenting with experience in sex, political activism and human relations. In the meantime, the film's crew, who makes the film, and we see their reactions to the story and to each other, are shown. Emergency, explicit sex and controversial policy kept this film from appearing in the United States while its charges from the customs were appealed. The film is a tale, but it is a documentary that shows us the film's back-scenes world during the story, the fourth wall is broken. This movie is the most direct way to make a movie I've ever seen. The film works predominantly as a time capsule of the psychedelic setbacks of the 1960s, fighting freedom and sexual liberation. I like to think of it so much more than that. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I'd waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I actually do. This movie is a buried treasure. Try it.
