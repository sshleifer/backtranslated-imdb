In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I became an instant Eddie fan after seeing Dress at Kill, but I have to say that I think this is his best work. However, I would say if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live. It is worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple of times, the jokes begin to grow old. But I have to say I have seen this show so many times that I literally have everything that is remembered (which yes, I am aware of is a little sad) but every joke makes me laugh. This is really a good show. <br /> <br /> Dress for Kill will never be old for me. I own it and see it anytime I need a good laugh.
