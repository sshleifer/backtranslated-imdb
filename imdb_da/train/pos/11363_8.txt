Imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a man spends 8 years of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder pretty much alone! The technique of murder is evident, but a government that is not willing to admit the truth let us destroy a monster of life. When I think my job is stressful, I only remember the true story behind this wonder flick. The protagonist's devotion to the protagonist was masterfully portrayed by Rea. The comical (and almost tragic at times) relationship between Rea and Sutherland-character made this my favorite movie from the last 5 years. The capture of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat. Although not as well advertised and talked about as "the silence of the Lamb", the plot was just as exciting.
