Rented this one by accident, it was behind the movie box of what I thought I was renting, didn't find out before I got home, so it anyway. Absolutely amazing! a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorites all the time, i recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is entertaining and easy to follow, it could have been easily confused, but the actors and director are doing a great job keeping it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are amazing, show a wonderful character and do a great job. <br /> <br /> Must find a copy somewhere ...........
