Now, this movie was probably one of the funniest scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the actor can say it's no gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a police officer, is so wrong he gets good. I don't know how, but he himself makes this movie a 10. You have to see if your into horror / slash movies makes it bloody and fun at the same time. Killer movie.
