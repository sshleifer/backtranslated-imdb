This has a lot for it - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a small amount of dross - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little ho hum - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real movie, where the producer used a buck and you could see it on the screen (previously he had appeared in two low budgeters, higher and higher and step lively), but if they had only invoked Sinatra pipes and deeply sixed Grayson's plus Iturbi's ego-tripping piano spots we would have been back with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As it is, he scores strongly in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - we hate leaving, I brought her - to her own solos, what makes the sunset, the charm of you and I fall in love too easily. Despite this, Step Lively is still the best Sinatra musical from the 40's on a tenth of the budget.
