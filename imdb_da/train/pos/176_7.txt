KEEP SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it. Okay, so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) deals with the cyclist for his clothes was fun. This guy's chef was also good. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had much more time on the screen together. They are chemistry great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, delicious. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a stranger and ends up in the White House in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politics. Talking about Sarandon would be giving away a lot. SPOILERS This is a rather unusual romantic / political comedy, and it satisfies both something - the political side a lot more than the romantic one. It touches on political issues, and just shines in romantic areas. <br /> <br />
