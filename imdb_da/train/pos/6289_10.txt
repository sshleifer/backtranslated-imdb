This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was beaten by critics when it came out and was blamed for destroying Nicolas Cage's career. What I don't think people get is that it's not supposed to be an epic, Oscar-fighting movie, it's just some amazing "Bruck buster" activities at best. Fast cars, quick editing and a good soundtrack - it does exactly what is on the tin. Also for anyone who likes cars it is a clean treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and let's not forget Eleanor! I think you would be hard pressed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all !! So again, maybe it's just me!
