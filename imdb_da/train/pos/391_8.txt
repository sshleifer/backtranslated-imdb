"Zu: The Warriors of Magic Mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You would never have guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Clark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued to do this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now, it can measure up to other movies in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is associated with "Zu" warriors from magical mountain "! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of it. The plot is a little hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't." It's all about the action and the adventure! I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe it's too much, but the overall result is so beautiful that I'm not going to be critical of it. So much is happening on the screen, you just don't think so! I think it's a great shame that this movie was not shown on theaters here in the Netherlands. movies can easily beat big big Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is the lack of humor! In most of Tsui Hark's films he combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor. missing in this movie, again i will not be n jeregnende abo out these small issues. The "Legend of Zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you want to see. A true classic!
