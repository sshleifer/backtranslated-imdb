demonicus rocked, you need to understand how hard it rocked, unfortunately the words needed to explain the extent of rocking have not been discovered. for a little idea, pop like 50 hits by E, see Death Factory while on the phone with Jesus, wait, Jesus is waiting, you have phone sex with Will Smith on the primary line. seriously, the movie ... so good. you have to see it at least a 4 times to capture all the subtleties ... yes, not so much finesse as much as it takes the length of the movie, times 4 to consider why full moon people are allowed to A, live and B, reproduce. What is our world coming to?
