I must admit that I was totally shocked at this movie. For one, I went to look at a whim, expecting something mediocre, but considering this, it was the most shocking thing that this was in a populist American movie. This is British comedy at its finest - dark, quirky and fun in ways that American movies are never. However, I have to stop recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone; I went to see it with more people, some English, some European and some American and while some of us loved it (mostly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you are in this kind of thing, go. If not, don't. 10/10.
