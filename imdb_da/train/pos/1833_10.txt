Aditiya (Kumar) is the broken son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan), who owns a toy industry. In Ishwar's eyes, his son Aditya cannot do anything wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late, because Ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live when his son topples and marries Mitali (Chopra), rejects Ishwar Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali come back from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant and this forces Ishwar to kick Aditya out of the house to make him more accountable, Aditya does not know that his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he does not know his father has kicked him out of the snake to make him more responsible, Ishwar cannot lead to high Aditya that he is to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. It's a race against time, so Aditya does everything he can to prove himself to his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the movie industry, and his father tells him he's about to die. This movie is absolutely brilliant, this is the breakthrough in the Indian movie needed for the Bollywood industry, Shah's directing is almost flawless, but which movie is not wrong? The best part if this movie is the father's son relationship, which is a tower cherry. the song interludes is just placed at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav jokes are too long, and after a while they are annoying, but generally this is a brilliant movie, I advise anyone reading this review to go and see it regardless of other reviews. 9.10
