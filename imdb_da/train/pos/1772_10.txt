What a relief to find out, I don't imagine this program! The summary from the taxman is amazing. I also remember that it was joking and not very family show, I must have been 10/11 at the time I saw it. I think a girl who is part of the attraction was the very blonde hair of the lead and his permanently sad state. The theme was played on a flute I remember - even though I can't remember how it went. I think the intro showed him playing it - or maybe he played a flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm definitely never to know how it ended or to watch clips or hear the melody, but at least I now know that it's not just me.
