I don't know the stars or the modern Chinese teenage music - but I know a thoroughly entertaining movie when I see one. Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it is played by laughs, for love and is a great blend of Kung Fu and basketball. Everybody looks as though they were having fun doing this - the production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks shinier than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The reason for the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school just to be kicked out and then discover superstars like a basketball game (and love and more, etc.) is amazing - it's fresh, fun and incredibly entertaining. <br /> <br /> With great action and good dialogue, this is just to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we see for a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a try - we were really glad we did - a good sports comedy movie.
