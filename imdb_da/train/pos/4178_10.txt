This film is a true reflection of the Australian ingenuity that has been needed to make this country what it is over the last 200 years. Not pompous as the British, not Gung-Ho as the Americans. If one of these countries had tried what this crew member did, it would have failed. Either because of ignorance of the British part or too much faith in superior firepower on the US side. "True" Australians (ie non-import) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
