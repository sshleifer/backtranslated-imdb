Steve Carrel proves to be a great leader in this wonderful, original and healthy fresh air. I though wet even at how brilliant it was. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film's title says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man working at an electronics store. He is a bit of a geek who loves video games and comics and has the largest collection. His friends working in the shop with him find out that he is a virgin under a full-fledged poker game with pretty sex discipline, and then Andy has to go through a pretty fun hell. Odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always turning up that leads to him does not lose his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky at the end. <br /> <br /> Let the little ones stay at home, but take the whole family to see this amazing romantic adult comedy. It will make you hang up and break up from the beginning, and when it is over, you want your extra thick absorbent underwear. Only other things I can say about it are too bad Steve Carrel was not recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago. He will surely win the best breakthrough male performance in the next years MTV Film Awards. You can bet on your hard earned dollars on it, people! <br /> <br /> I give this a perfect 10!
