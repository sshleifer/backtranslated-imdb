This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great plays. Mr. Torn and Ms Farrel do an excellent job. I think they should have it on TV again, so a new audience can enjoy it. Amazing performances. <br /> <br /> It gives you a true sense of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally. Great unheard of movie. <br /> <br /> It was done when Mrs Farrel was very young. I had always thought of her as a comedian, but it's certainly not a comedy, and she's just amazing. There are very small dialogues, but it just makes it more real. Mr. Towers that are always a good presence, and just his breathing has great feeling. I'll watch movies.
