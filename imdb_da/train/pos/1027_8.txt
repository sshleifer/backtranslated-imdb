I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'm just spitting my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series first. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I thought it was absolutely brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis thought it was the fifth most important person in the cast. Nothing special. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the court to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a rock. I don't know if that's because Hammond was more important that I realized or what, but for some reason after the seventh season, the series turned to ****. The first seven seasons, however, were awesome. The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out to be, although this was not the original intent, a brilliant set-up for the series. I recommend watching the movie first, so watch the first season in the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll get a whole new appreciation for the second time, believe me) and watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series aren't as good as the first seven, but that doesn't mean they're not good. It just means they are a letdown if you have been destroyed by the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> When you finish this series, be sure to watch the spin-off series, Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
