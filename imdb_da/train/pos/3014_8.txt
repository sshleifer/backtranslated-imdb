This amazing whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular movie genre. I was delighted to see William Powell handle a detective story of charisma and charm, and without the stupid attitude of his Nick Charles character (from the "Thin Man" series). While the story is good alone, I think what really makes this movie fun to see is Michael Curtiz's amazingly imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, this is a richly structured film, with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; From screenshots to strange camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz shows he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of movie.
