My favorite movie genre is western, it really is the only movie genre that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one makes them Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only black and white movie in the partnership of Director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film where Stewart chose a percentage of the profits instead of a straight pay from Universal. Many of these deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann until that point had made mostly B pictures, noir type things without real budgets. Just before Winchester, 73 Mann had made a fine vest with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, who never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided that Mann was the person he decided to work with. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann also developed a mini-company that John Ford was legendary for. In addition to Stewart, others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future Mann movies. <br /> <br /> It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why don't I say, but so far we have never seen such a rage out of James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann entered Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged some demons we all fear. <br /> <br /> Hate is appropriately demonstrated in a good moment toward the beginning of the movie. After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer, because guns are not worn at Earp's Dodge City. There is a shooter competition for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City, and the betting party is Dutch Henry Brown, who is threatened by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the salon, and Stewart and McNally meet at the same time and reach for weapons that are not there. Look at close-ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character Stewart runs into the movie is Waco Johnny Dean, played by Dan Duryea, who almost steals the movie. This could have been Duryea's best moment on the screen. He is a psychopathic outlaw killer who is deadly like a left-handed move even though he has two seven guns. <br /> <br /> Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters, whose fianc√© has entered a showdown of Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are with Duryea, who has wanted her. She plays on time until she can safely get away from him. Guess who she eventually won with? <br /> <br /> There are some amazing performances in some small roles, there is no sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian boss. Even John Alexander, known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace, has a short but impressive role as owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at various times. <br /> <br /> Man and Stewart made eight films together, five of the Westerners, and were ready to make a sixth Western Night Passage when they argued and Mann went away from the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.
