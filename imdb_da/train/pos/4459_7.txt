For such films as 'Anchors Aweigh', few have been donated with so many Academy Award awards in a warm hour warming. Whether in 1945 was a besieged year for good movie, or they still sounded shocked by Billy Wilders' The Lost Weekend, which they wrote something that began with A on the ballot for the best picture to please the quiet musical image of faithful public. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of her role in the 'Singin' in the rain, there had to be something wrong with the rear display systems at MGM. Of course, the study is at its best during this very welcomed tour of major studies and Hollywood itself, practical to those who are stuck on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Yet another seaman's musical musical with Gene and Frank Sinatra's brilliant talents is certainly an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to joke in the scholars for musical, so today's audiences would not be merged with unnecessary runtime. There have been many longer pieces before and since, but in this case all the charming Kathryn Grayson's scenes could have been eliminated. Until the show of "Kiss Me Kate" it may have been necessary to see non-opera enthusiasts some of her remote-controlled movies. <br /> <br /> If there was a need to rehearse women for 1949's' On the Town ', then the beach holiday had to be lucky sailors did not promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and turn the piano into a wholehearted `Susie' rendition. Few are lucky enough to get a screen test on MGM's golden studies. So few are even happier to be present. There is no regret that Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson has completed a successful screen test, but it does give the continuing non-opera enthusiast hope of any pink slip to be handed out to both. <br /> <br /> But for all, the star's talents are good form and an above average score threw in with a small but fun big fleet story intertwined with young ambitious marine boys who are good for late anxiety outbreaks, Ankre's at least not in doubt about choosing the wrong MGM movie. The direction stops when the cast carries the story in nice color kinematography. When someone fails in music or singing, the film makes a happy occasion. <br /> <br /> The natural highlight of the movie is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventure in a fantasy land that climbs into a brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse. This is a well-deserved masterpiece of Kelly's career, and it's great to know that he was thinking about it before Fred Astaire began dancing on walls and ceilings. It is not exactly to sit down to a triple taste, rainbow trout, chocolate plates, cream cherries and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow melts in the mouth and, despite the blame, is still a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
