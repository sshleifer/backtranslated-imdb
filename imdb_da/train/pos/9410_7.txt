I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people refer to it as a comedy. It was fun at times, but it wasn't fun at all. If I had expected to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the movie, but I went in without expectations and found it comfortable and engaging. Maybe it was because I as an engineer identified me with the main character. I was less worried about the satire of capital or work, and more into the basic story of a man struggling for his invention. A man who is less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it, will pursue and be put into production. He is completely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; I compare it to The Fountainhead.
