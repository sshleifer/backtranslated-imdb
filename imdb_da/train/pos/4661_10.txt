I can only echo the other reviews here. It is a nice movie with a feel-good factor that it achieves without crossing the line to mushrooming sentimentality. Naturally sweet - No added sugar. A small point: It seems to me that the mild objections raised over Ustinov's character, Pendelton, able to go in and defeat the security of the system, ignores the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant of this kind of thing. Yes, the movie was pretty computer illiterate, but it showed Pendelton studying computers at his apartment, and I think the implication would be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject practically overnight. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of weird moments when it seemed in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test the Pendent's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure if we should believe that Pendelton's game whispered his way out of those situations or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests - it was a bit unclear. had to know enough to create dummy accounts. Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own fuzzy understanding of how computers functioned these days, and in order to understand in detail what they came to, it is necessary to know exactly what their concept was. They knew there was something about 'procedures' that was important; they believed that the "clear light" could actually control security, rather than simply indicating its condition; they thought that the (stupid) user terminal's functions would greatly affect what could be done on the main frame itself - although it is not something like a graphics function, I do not see it myself. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I think they were trying to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could and they did pretty well. Allowing them a little artistic license, I don't think their efforts had any deficits worth noting. <br /> <br /> CD
