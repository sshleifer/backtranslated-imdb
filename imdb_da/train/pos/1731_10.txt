The sexploitation film's era in the late 60s and early 70s began with the addition of free nudity in mainstream movies and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It was no more than a year between 1968 and 1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult of followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who followed the lead roles in these flicks, and her subsequent credits showed it. And her apparently deliberately faded in obscurity, just as her career started, only increases her mystery. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sex drive genre, and his skill combined with Monica Gayle's screen presence makes Sandra, Making of a Woman, a pleasurable enjoyable experience. The movie never pulls and you don't want your finger pressed on the fast forward button.
