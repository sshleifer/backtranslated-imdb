I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We're still together. <br /> <br /> But in the 1950s it would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the military had been mined for action, drama and comedy for years at this point. Mined to death. The mixed relations gave the new foundation to cover. This is old hat today, but then ...? Married an Asian back then you either meant fault or you were a freak of some sort. This affected both options with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than he usually does. He is good, but it turned out how good he could be. Umecki-chan had a helluva debut here, and while I think she was serving her statue, she didn't really jump. It was a role that no one who had not been abroad would have recognized and newness was corker. The real scene steals were Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank it. And the Japanese lifestyle was also shown in an admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
