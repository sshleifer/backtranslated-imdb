The critics did not like this movie. It bombed in the states and consequently received only a limited view in Britain. It was a great shame because it represents British rather than American humor and should have been shown in Britain first. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks great and is a very compelling Russian. Ben Chaplin is the Dustin Hoffman character from 'The Graduate' and the 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes reminiscent of the viewer of the 1960's classic (despite being a completely different story!). <br /> <br /> Sure it changes many times from comedy to black comedy to thriller for adventure - but it is memorable, moving and fresh fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster. <br /> <br /> See it with an open mind!
