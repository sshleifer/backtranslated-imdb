I came in the middle of this movie, so I had no idea of ​​any credits or even its title until I saw it up here, seeing that it received a mixed reception from your commentators. I'm on the positive side about this movie, but one thing really got my attention as I saw: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was amazing when I discovered the score written by none other than John Williams himself. True, he has written sensitive and pointed scores like Schindler's List, but usually he associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams has written for this movie, surpasses everything I've ever heard of his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, in keeping with the tender and delightful plot of the movie. And another recent score of his, for Catch Me, if you can, is showing ever more joke and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like teaching films like How Green was my valley and Konrack, one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina and Danny deVito's Renaissance man, etc. They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening. history that cannot tell often enough. This is an excellent addition to that genre.
