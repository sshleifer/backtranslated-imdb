For Columbo fans, like myself, this is the episode of episodes that made a case of why Columbo was so popular and just how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (like ever) playing the wittily intelligent crime writer Abigail Mitchell. Seems Abigail calls his son-in-law to sign some papers that make him his heir. She never died over her niece and is convinced that her dead niece's husband (Charles Frank) did the filthy deed. Telling more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a blurry role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class alone. It is a really well made TV movie. I highly recommend it.
