The real goal of a fictitious job is whether the characters grow from their experience and emerged from the experience changed in some significant way (note that this change does not have to be positive or beneficial) at the end. <br /> <By this measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success. As a movie, the pretty excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters you will watch, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations succeed. In short, the movie is very enchanting. Although all performances are top notch, three-Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright are to be mentioned. It says something when Miranda Richardson does his usual good work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the casting. Most recommended, especially if you are romantic in heart. Additional Deponent does not say.
