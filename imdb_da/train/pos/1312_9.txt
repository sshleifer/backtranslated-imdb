Criticize this one in the win column, it was a great movie. The working performance was great, and the manuscript was just as great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was magnificent as Riverside Police Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie policeman with the Riverside Police Dept. She ended up in an affair with a colleague that she knew she had a wife and children while constantly taking the dangerous task of undercover to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looks similar) did a nice job as the confused, often tribal, police officer having an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to his feelings and his marital affair. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, especially from the sitcom "Wings", did a good job as the quiet, clever, understated sociopath. On the surface he was an innocent loser, but under the surface a cold-hearted killer lied. Weber really took persona with a childish young adult with an insatiable thirst for killing young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, every oral exchange, tells us more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal work on condensing days, if not weeks worth of events in a 90 minute movie. This film was a good example of doing a lot with little.
