This early Anime movie was a pretty good movie I once caught on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the rating disaster that adult swimmer claims it is on the cartoon network. Frankly, I think it has less to do with being less popular and more with the fact that people would rather buy DVDs, so the episodes are unknown on the internet. This movie probably doesn't have all the many cuts, and the voting was okay for a dubbed movie, though I'd rather see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in something called. This movie has a young boy who manages a train called Galaxy Express in the hope that he can make it a planet that has the technology to make him a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered in the hands of a robot chasing people for fun. During his adventure, he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman who looks like her late mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, as with most women in Anime movies, has a secret that could either be really good for our youngsters, really or really bad. He goes from the planet to the planet also when the train makes various stops, and he runs into a space pirate named Captain Harlock, who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series, so basically the Galaxy Express is in that universe. All in all, a very good trip with a rather strange and unexpected ending. There would be a sequel to this, but it wasn't quite as good as this one, but the end was a little more final than it was here.
