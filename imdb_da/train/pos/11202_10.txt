First, I thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with the regular plot. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anxiety. The way he portrays the fair's popular crowds, the strength of the girl's appeal to both men, the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest films (North to Northwest, Rope, etc.). The driver did well even before his thirty!
