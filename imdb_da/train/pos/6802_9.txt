You can see this episode better from the beginning, because if you start to see it later, you will be confused about what happens to Clark's life. But that's twist; Clark is stuck in an alternative reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair because of the bridge accident when he swung to miss Clark in the pilot's series. Martha is married to Lionel. About the only constant is his most loyal friend, Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yes, he has no superpowers. He is in a mental institution to sit in a fantasy world where he has powers and is ridiculed for believing it. Apart from Chloe, there is a mysterious figure who believes in Clark: A black man who, in the alternative reality, also resides in the institution who thinks he's from Mars. Clark must be true to everything he thinks is the real reality and not brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist who is actually the fourth Phantom Zone escapee. This episode is completely insane and shocking. Plus, it gives a new twist from the usual type of "Smallville" episode.
