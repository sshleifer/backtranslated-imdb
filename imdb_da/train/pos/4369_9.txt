I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some good twists and turns, and the signs were well rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" scored far above average. First, I have rarely seen a "popular" movie where the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were many verbal slashes and bumps to accompany the excellent choreographed sword. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understood a principle rarely recognized. For a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a truly credible villain. If you do not have one, there is not much joy in rooting for the good guys. And "Rob Roy" doesn't have one, but three - Earl of Montrose, his artisan Kilairn and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains, either but fullness and very unpleasant. It requires a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue and the accents are a bit tough, but it is a much more smart and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
