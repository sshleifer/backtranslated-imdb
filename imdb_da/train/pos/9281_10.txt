I don't know how and where the Iranian directors get their inspiration to come up with a plot like this. In fact, it is a very simple plot that many directors could come up with - but may not be able to project it on a movie that Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The movie is like 2 worlds rotating at the same time connecting one with each other - the football game and the battle between sexes going on behind the stadium walls. It makes you feel like you're in the movie, and you're one of the characters and while watching the movie, as if you'd also like a glimpse of the football game. You will feel exactly the same excitement and emotions as the female actors in the movie. It is poignant in a way that you wanted to see the end you want to find out the judgment you want to die to see what will happen to the girls. I like the intermittent conversations between the smoke girl and one of the military students. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in men's and women's thinking and women's struggle to gain equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is another movie by Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and looking forward to seeing more. <br /> <br /> Already hooked on Iranian movies, this is a must-see!
