I have read the book and I have to say that this film remains true to form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith provides an excellent support actor as the neighbor's neighbor. I've seen this movie at least twice, and I think I'm going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The excitement just goes on to build the climatic end, the twist you will never come. If you like movies like Characters and Village, Sentinel will be a classic foreplay. Also, what's interesting is the actors in the movie - you wouldn't recognize them if you didn't read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is great as a trading director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, which is undervalued but great.
