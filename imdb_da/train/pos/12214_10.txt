This low-budget digital video film has strengths in the right places - write and act. Moreover, digital photography is the best of the party so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic video has an umber tone, but surprisingly it competes for film brightness, clarity and saturation in bright situations. This is grassroots film that makes it best with a chat dialogue that carries a "Midnight Cowboy" kind of story of greats, what it takes to survive in the cities of San Francisco.
