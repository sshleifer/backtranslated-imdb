I enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the pumped-up steroid wastes that have gone into action movies, Playing God is simple and realistic, with signs that are credible, action that is not over the top and enough phrases to keep you interested until the end. . <br /> <br /> Well directed, well-behaved and a good story.
