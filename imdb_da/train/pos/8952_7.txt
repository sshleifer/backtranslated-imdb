Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. The secret is attracted to his normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She throws a magic on Shep, forcing him to dump her fiance and fall for her. Things go well together until Gillian discovers she really cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep respond when he finds out he was "tricked" into falling in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, the Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It is a comfortable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who is sitting there. Just don't go into the movie that expects the biggest thing since the slices. The movie is cute, fun at times and touches at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks pretty incredible in a discreet way. The support noise with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often ridiculously fun and steals a lot of spotlights from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it will be. Is it a screw basketball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie could have been even better and more memorable.
