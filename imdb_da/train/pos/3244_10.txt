I couldn't agree more with the Nomad 7 and I A HVR's comments. A perfectly laid back Sunday morning movie. The mood is subtle (as opposed to "slapstick" as a mistaken commentary noted). <br /> <br /> But what always ceases to amaze me is how often I find myself going back to this movie over and over again. I originally copied this movie to VHS about 12 years ago, as it premiered on one of those Pay Cable free weekend previews (HBO maybe?). Never heard of it before. Don't know why it wasn't marketed as well. ?? When DVDs were released a lot, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. Moreover, the back of the Montana desert does not hurt (beautiful). It's probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler kind of thing is up in your alley, it probably won't be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. Humor is mostly in the dialog box. <br /> <br /> I think my next view is likely to be in my 12. But I still know that when it comes to the scene as the one where police caps start to blow, I will lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is FREE!). Recommended 110%.
