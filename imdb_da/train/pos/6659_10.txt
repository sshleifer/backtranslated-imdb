It takes courage to make a movie at Gandhi in India, where he does not appear as a man who could not do anything wrong. This movie shows how a Mahatma was not a decent father (at least in his son's eyes). <br /> <br /> The show is amazing, the movie scene is amazing, the direction fantastic, but the movie pulls. If the intention was to make this movie without any expectations of the box office that I assume is the case here, then it is an excellent attempt, but if the decision makers expected to be a commercial success, the fate of the film was judged on the day they chose this topic. <br /> <br /> 20 years from now, this film will be remembered for the brilliant depiction of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one. And honestly, his is not the only performance worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is great too. <br /> <br /> See the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death. No dialogues, no screams, but a speechless shot of Khanna. It's one of the finest scenes ever shot in Cinema's history <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my Dad is not at all an exciting movie theater, but yes, its excellent movie theater and a must watch.Brilliant Attempt ..
