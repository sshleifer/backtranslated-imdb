An exciting thriller that has some resemblance to release as for scenery and surroundings. There are also some very innovative shot scenes and good music, although one and the seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is unsuitable for the situation, although this is not a mayor problem. It also raises interesting questions about justice of revenge and boundaries of friendship. <br /> <br />
