Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith this could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is in her best, and for fans of Maggie, it's great to see her in her early days, matching Ustinov every step of the way with and timing. For Englishmen in their fifties (and I am in that context) it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear the sounds of the swinging 60s, and although this movie spends a lot of time in offices, it has lots of 60s nostalgia, including red buses, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delicious shot at a waitress that England has never seen in public places. As an I.T. engineer, I know computer hacking tricks are ridiculous, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. Nor are there the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and German.
