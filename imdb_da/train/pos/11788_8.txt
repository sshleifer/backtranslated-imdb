I really think people are taking the wrong approach on this. First of all, I find this short film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the excitement and mystery are brilliant in their insight into the guard. Another thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer, even though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and feelings played out by the characters that give you the impression that there is a story to everything what's going on. No one else could have done better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at best. Sure I would agree with everyone that people who begin to see this with a desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work by the viewers will be disappointed. And rightly so. Lynch is not about it. At least, this side of Lynch is not. The one who helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is at full tilt here and people who just expect to be entertained like they would see something else just won't get what it's all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is about cheating with your zodiac, your instinctual self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) that you instinctively respond to. It's not about any kind of pleasure; it's about getting the desired reaction out of you. And that, my friend, is pure art.
