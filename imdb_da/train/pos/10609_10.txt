I watched this movie last night on cable and it is extraordinary. What I love most about it is that it is undervalued and low-key, but deeply fervent. Henry Thomas (he played the baby in E.T.) performance is masterfully articulate (he must be a few words man). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy crook. And miraculously (given that we are talking about a Hollywood product here), a baby serves as a protagonist, but one who does not act or has lines, but only is (and is shining there). Interesting to note that Thomas' mysterious relationship w. E. T. was the core of that film; while his ties w. the baby serves as the core of "a good baby". <br /> <br /> there is the music - ah, what music !! Gillian Welch's tunes are wonderful and the whole score is beautiful hill country music. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
