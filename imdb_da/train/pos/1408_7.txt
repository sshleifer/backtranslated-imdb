A Pentagon science team seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility, but when leading boffin tries it on itself, it can't reverse the process. Frustrated and full of power, he becomes psychotic in the classic HG Wells tradition. This is a pleasingly horrible Invisible Man story, delivered with the taste of the ever-tasteful Verhoeven and Bacon as brilliant-turned-loonytoon maniac. As with much of Verhoeven's work, it has an amazingly unobstructed sense of Boy's-Own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where scientists work is just amazing) combined with the most horrible and depraved pictures (women in their underwear are groped and attacked by an invisible enemy, animals killed, literally blood tones and wholesale slaughter in the last two wheels). While history doesn't call any new twists on an old idea, the Scott E. Anderson CG special effects are dazzlingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh all literally appearing nowhere. In particular, an order in which the team returns a gorilla from the invisible state and the scene where Bacon drowns Devane in a swimming pool is absolutely stunning in detail and artistic inventions of the effects. The movie also features a fantastic soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror film photography by Jost Vacano. The young cast is largely overshadowed by the film's technical pedigree, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive out of their depth. This is a very funny nasty movie.
