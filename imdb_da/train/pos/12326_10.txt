I saw this movie first at the Berlin Film Festival, and I had never seen Hong Kong cinema before. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: The action was so fast, and there wasn't a dull moment in the whole movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes that emphasizes the extraordinary musical component of the movie. This movie is a definite must !!
