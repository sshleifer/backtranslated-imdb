Well not really. However, this movie is very entertaining. Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the routine "I think there is something in my eye". The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is great as one down on his lucky reporter who gets the power to change himself and the city where he lives. In fact, all the characters are great. The movie is not too fun or juicy, good flick to see with the wife. <br /> <br /> All in all, 8/10 .... note * I'm not an easy one. It's everything from BigV over and over!
