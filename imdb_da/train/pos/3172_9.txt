Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most comfortable indie films I've seen in the past year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the author's debut movie. I mean - I log in to IMDb to find more movies by this author ... because Cross Eyed has the unique signature - you want to see what that author might say. These days, it is rare to see a film that is well-written, orderly, well-edited and well-acted. For me - Cross Eyed encapsulates what filmmaking should be about - combining the best of all movie elements to create a smart, artistic and exciting story. More, thank you.
