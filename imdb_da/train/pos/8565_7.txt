If you like animal movies, this movie will thank you. My wife likes animal and expensive movies, she especially likes the parrot in this movie. It is aimed at children, but I mostly laughed at humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and adds balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its sappy, fortunately, family apeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive fealing.
