This movie has received horrible reviews from almost everyone who voted here, but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my car and stupid and judge, this movie is for you. If your movie into movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id should suck you at a different angle. But I still love this movie and all about it, though it is a little "kiddy", is one of the few movies I and my friends have been able to watch over the years and quote whenever possible. GREAT MOVIES. This movie should be AFIs number 1 because it is so friggin 'high class. The only problem with this movie is that you might have trouble seeing it because it was made for TV movies on a channel that no longer exists. So I don't know how to get this movie, I like to buy it for DVD, but I can't find it anywhere. I still have the taped off as it was the first time you can get over if you want to and see it, but I can sleep. This movie rocker and it is basically everything you need to know.
