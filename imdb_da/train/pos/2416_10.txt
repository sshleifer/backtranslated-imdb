Yes, it's a bit of a silly movie, so if you're looking for an oscar performance, forget about this ... ...... but if you love John Candy's humor then it's a must-see. We lost John Candy before he did enough of his amazing comedy, and he's only better off in a movie: Planes, Trains, & Automobiles (with Steve Martin). Excellent supportive performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work ever as the head Sal DiPasquale. Also good plays by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. You should watch this unclear and unprinted movie if you are a John Candy or Eugene Levy fan.
