This movie has a stable and exciting pace supported by great acting (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story revealed to us over time. <br /> <br /> In addition, music creates the mood and helps maintain a restless, cautious and gloomy tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginal, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy subject that is vicious. <br /> <br /> Although not related to history as well as genre, the same feeling remained in me as Ursula Le Guin's "Lathe of Heaven" (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember that "hacking and cutting" does not make a movie a horror movie, it is the psychological element of fear and scare that rests in all of us.
