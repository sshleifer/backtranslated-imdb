Radio was not a 24-hour 7 days a week that arose when I grew up in the 1930s England, so Children's Hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and a power supply accumulator. The few programs I heard therefore made a big impression on my young mind, and the 3 I still remember are "Toytown", one of all the animals at the Zoo and Gray Owl, talking about the animals he knew. as he called his "brothers". It was only recently that I learned that Gray Owl was not a true "Indian", but the tribute paid by Sioux Chief makes great sense to me "A man is what he dreams". Would we all be able to dream as world-changing and beneficial as Archie Gray Owl Belaney. It would be that a new Gray Owl could affect world leaders to clean up the environment.
