It's a great movie. probably the best movie I've ever seen. I see it again and again. I have to give it 10/10 stars because as I said this is probably the best movie I've ever seen. This movie + Popcorn + Coke = Best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch some movies then I definitely recommend this one. First I saw it, I liked it, so I bought it and now I own it and see it safe every day. my sons like it and think this is the best movie ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I don't want to ruin the whole movie so you can enjoy it after reading my text. Lovely movie Lovely characters, nice story and just good things. a must see movie. hope you've had my comment Cya <br /> <br /> Jim Make
