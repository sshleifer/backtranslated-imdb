If you are a hard core Freddy fan then you may not like it. This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason it keeps itself is the history of Freddy. The only thing that is always great in Nightmare movies is death scenes. But death scenes were very bleak in this. The visual effects were great and the play was OK, but the back story was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story is full circle in this. <br /> <br /> I've read bad reviews for this, but I really enjoyed it despite its many flaws: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy is dead: The final nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy the series. This is where Freddy is fully explained, but that's all there is. Next on my list Wes Craven's New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
