Suddenly, Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at some point in his career when he had established a good reputation as director. The reason is actually not the film itself, but the attitude it takes to vigilantism, as it seems to support. In some places it is actually due more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry movie. You can argue, if that's the case - at the end of the day it's a movie about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day, it's more empathy than sympathy. But in light of all these arguments, it is easily overlooked that sudden effects are a very well made movie. Forget "Keep punk, make my day scene", it's iconic but not original. But look at San Francisco's views taken from the air and zoom in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or look at the brilliantly created scene where Sondra Locke's character visits his mentally ill at the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of facial joining. So overall, Sudden Impact is a very visual movie that really shows how mature Eastwood is as an instructor. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood put it on the screen, albeit in an action movie of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first successful movie Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has a tremendous talent as an instructor, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.) Narrative riches, the visual elements are well integrated into the movie and do not distract the story. The only thing that is very annoying is the spinning dog.
