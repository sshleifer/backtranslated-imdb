This is a tea cartoon that should have won instead of Country Cousin. Visually well done and much more entertaining and memorable. Worth looking just at the music alone! Although there are elements that will undoubtedly blow some of the sensibilities these days, the sign must have a little perspective. It's over sixty years old, and that's just a cartoon. I am disabled, and if I was as hypersensitive as the people who look at things like this cartoon and take a bias, I would long curled up in a fake position and faded away. Sometimes you need to light up, put your head back and float! Cartoon caricatures were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby allegedly hated it when he was used for more than one occasion. * SIGH *
