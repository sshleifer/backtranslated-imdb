I've seen the first 17 episodes, and this series is simply amazing! I have not been interested in an anime series since the Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on a h-game that I am not sure whether it is done before or not, I have not played the game, but from what I have heard it follows it very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series a 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've seen. It also has some amazing Japanese music in it too! <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this series yet, check it out. You can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there, it's just out of Japan.
