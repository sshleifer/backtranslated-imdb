Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller, offering its share of action, chaos, murder and pig bloodshed. Essentially, a bodyguard search and destroy mission, as his responsibility, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent. Mexico City sites are as chaotic as history moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion, with plot twists en route. Washington, a former CIA operative with a drinking problem, gets a good reference from a former co-agent who paves the way for the disposition. Washington and Fanning have a good chemistry between them, and after a difficult start, the bodyguard and his responsibility become the best of friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke include the good cast in support of the two stars.
