This movie is very interesting. I've seen it twice, and it seems that Glover hit the nail upside down with what he claims to do. I for one can relate to the indignation that the filmmaker clearly expresses itself against the current thoughtless business operation, which is an attack in our every media center and the things that we as a culture are supposed to "think" not because of corporate media control. The disgrace that Glover expresses through the "monstrous" elements of the films is both clear in his visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in his poetic strength. I'm glad I watched this movie, and it's even clearer that Glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is fine! EVERYTHING IS FINE. See it too. People who reject this movie as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" really miss the boat. This is an intelligent movie. If you can see it with his live show, he will perform with his books before, it is also very angry. The way you enter his mind is really something. You want an experience!
