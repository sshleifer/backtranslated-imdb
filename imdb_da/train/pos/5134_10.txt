This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had won! Basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood often embraced Jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare glance at movies on an improvisational jam. This has been added to the movie preservation list and deserved it. TCM runs this as a filler on a regular basis and runs it once every March for its "31 Days of Oscar" tribute. From the center of the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and the shot is so smooth, just moved just. Most solid and highly recommended !!!
