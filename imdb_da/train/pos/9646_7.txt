There are certainly feelings between the two main characters, as they explore their relationship - based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there are also emotions in Mathieu's family interventions with his mother's problems - and how it is going to bear on their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves many things unanswered (unless I'm just too stupid to get them). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the boys' break-up? And flashing back between the present and the past is a little difficult to follow first. It seems that the main reason for renting this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills or some male nudity. But as a love story or character study, it is lacking and unsatisfactory.
