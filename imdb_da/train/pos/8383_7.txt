Robot Jox is trying hard but is basically a series of combat situations stretched together - robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. The assumption had potential, but it seems that the manuscript was not really given the few more drafts it needed. Still, it was pretty good for a science fiction action movie. Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War." It is considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels, right up there with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this movie is really more like a giant battle armor movie, rather than giant robots. It is closer to what fans would have liked instead of the travesty that was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", who only bore a transitory resemblance to the novel it was based on. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, this is not really based on Homer's "Iliad". A few names are all they had in common. Achilles, who had his robot foot blown, had no parallel in the Iliad, which did not include Achilles death. The old Achilles was also not a noble warrior. He was the most powerful, but also avid and petty. Even the robot that was killed in the first scene does not fit. He was called Hercules, while the Greek Iliad would have had Heracles. <br /> <br /> The effects were pretty good for the time and budget. True, it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but that movie cost ten times as much. The stop movement was almost as good as the robot hikers in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Jedi Return." It is better than a lot of Ray Harryhausen animation, which is highly regarded, but rather dated. <br /> <br /> Don't let high expectations into this, and you won't be disappointed. It's better than many other low budget tabs and even some big budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects, but far worse scripts.
