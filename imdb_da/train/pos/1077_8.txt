This is comedy as it once was, and compares this with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and IS WE NOT MADE?, Just pointing out how 40's filmmakers had a comedy flair that has been regrettably lost since. <br /> <br /> I was 15 when I first saw this and even at the tender age, there was a lot I could laugh at. Now, of course, I'm familiar with adult frustrations, I see a lot I missed as a youth. <br /> <br /> The three main players ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... interact perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations that come from achieving a dream. It is never as easy and free of invisible complications as you imagine. <br /> All in all, this is a classic comedy that still faces the attempts to re-insert it.
