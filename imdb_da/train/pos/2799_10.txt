As an anti-football person I took (on the surface) mature my younger brother to watch this movie, though I secretly hoped it could be East's East II. The trailers looked funny so I thought I'd give it a ride. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but after that I was glued to the screen and it was nothing to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too close to the front because of a packed auditorium. The action was fresh and vibrant, the characters engaged and the jokes really fun. The entire auditorium was laughing loudly every minute or so. The football fan or no football fan, sports became irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a touch of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen for a long time, I dare say it .... better than East is East. <br /> <br /> Despite being nicely at a nice pace, this movie never stays on anything longer than necessary or leaves something unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. While it's not a distinctive twist and twist, there are some nice surprises along the way, and things don't always go as you would expect. <br /> <br /> Saying there were elements of predictability, but these were exploited satirically more than used as script fillers. I suspect, depending on your particular love for happy endings, you could either be happy / failed at the end. Personally, if there was any other result, I would have written a strongly formulated letter to the screenwriters. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I must say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) put the best performance. I never knew people like that existed, but she has her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me that they might do it! The price of the most convincing (of the protagonists) unfortunately goes to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not confuse me even though she offered a good performance, it is just that someone must be last of the best and sorry Kiera, this time you the. <br /> <br /> Tip: Don't leave before the credits. When the lights came up again, I realized in my horror that I might not have seen this movie. My beloved, but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugar blue juice. Oh, what do I say, it was all shine and I can't recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I'm just jumping out if it's really worth it.
