Don't listen to the many acute and inclined comments made on this movie ..... Just put on ninja movies, my friends are as good as it gets! <br /> <br /> Yes, it is silly, yes the play and script are absolutely horrible, but with gum - it's so much bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, it's awful "acting" (which in the case of that movie is really among the worst I've ever had the pleasure of seeing!) And ridiculously 'plot' actually only serves to raise the level of enjoyment ten times. Of course, the battle scenes are the main attraction of this though and mostly I am happy to say that they are very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (where we find that the ninja is not apparently limited by the normal gravity requirements ....) < br /> <br /> Trust me about this if you are a fan of ninja movies and you haven't seen Sakura Killers yet, then you really miss what I think is one of the true jewels of the genre crown.
