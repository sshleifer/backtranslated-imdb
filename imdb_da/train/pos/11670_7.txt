A spring-weight plot and questionable characterizations do not make any difference when a movie is so fun to see as this one is. Lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zipper. And there is a real comedy from ripping chemistry between the two leaders. Quinn also makes a good villain, although his role is completely overshadowed. <br /> <br /> But don't be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's tough broad role, it's as sexist as any Hollywood movie in this era. You may be able to forgive it because of the time it was made, but it's still hard to get by. For all the heroic and cruel adult offscreen situations, this is still a little more than a youngster's good time.
