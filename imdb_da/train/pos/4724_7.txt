Prison: Buried live leads us to a resort that has just opened and is about to close. We start with a guy in gear that jumps up to avoid the possibility of avalanches. Somehow, it doesn't make sense. Anyway, he is blowing away a particularly large one when he notes the resort is open. in spite of his best efforts, higher authority tells that his day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon everyone expects an avalanche hit. <br /> <br /> Look, I don't want to reveal more, all I can say is that this was a B-movie designed for the family channel (which I just watched it and the fact that it didn't have advertisements , showing that it is a B-movie), it's a pretty decent movie, but it's partially unreal. <br /> <br /> First, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. not only traced by powder. or what about a CD for a screwdriver? it is not possible. Finally, it cannot be stressed enough that an explosion cannot stop an avalanche, guaranteed. Furthermore, it is worth renting or watching TV, but not owning. 10.7. <br /> <br /> The movie is classified PG, but maybe it should have got something a little more powerful. a boy almost loses his foot in a lift, but his legs are cut around the ankle, a guy is shaken by electricity and diesel, and in the gravity room the dead people are around. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
