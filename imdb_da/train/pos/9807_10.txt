I can remember this series as well. It was excellent - so strong and convincing characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from anything else on offer at that time - and now ... I'm sure it also inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK. It's a pleasure to see the series again. Season 1 is 13 episodes, and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. Unfortunately, it seems to be completed after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it special at Amazon.co.uk
