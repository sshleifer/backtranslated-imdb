Domestic Import was a fantastic movie. I laughed all the time. It was fun at so many levels from the crazy clothes to the fun situations. The action was great. All Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all the others did a fantastic job. Because it is an independent film written by a first-time author, it does not have the clich√©s expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. It was unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-breaking story. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, then it is fun (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
