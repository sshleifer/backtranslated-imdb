well i was a teenager when i saw the movie. the songs were a big hit, but the elite class jumped over the govinda movie again, as coz watching govinda and karishma (aka karizma) movies were not in things for the 'class' but nevertheless a lot of people liked it when the series of These films rocked the 90s and most of them succeeded. Today I saw it again after a long time, and I remembered that there was a long que with people and the rebellion they created when the aa eo oo song came on the screen .... govinda and karishma dress was free to each other (the worst dressing duo of that time) good charisma in the late 90s transformed, but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer since his dress sense remains the same ... but then it was all mixed. It was all good. Everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it lacked and then ..... there was no retrospect for this jodi as it went on to make the Indian bearings of a few but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with nothing to rent it or watch it on TV, I don't think you will regret it ... but remember it is worst at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm still watching these movies when I get the time coz, I can't stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and feel good as there are times when we all love stupidity and especially when it is done by the kings in their time, it is probably secular ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
