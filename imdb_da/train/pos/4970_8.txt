Some critics found this movie bleak, but for me there was enough good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the daughter's quiet and positive character is the quiet center of the film, which often counteracts the unhappy aspects of the setting and the plot line. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with original ideas and characters, and the final result is not predictable: I felt it could have gone in some way. <br /> <br /> That way, many reviews I've read mentioned, the effective use of black and white, but the print I saw shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia was in full color. <br /> <br />
