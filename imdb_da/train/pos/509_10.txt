"Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all began. Enter 150 years into our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This part of the Star Trek franchise is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS" to restore the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement to "Going where no man has gone before". Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the whole cast really show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is Brilliant as the stranger Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock are absolutely delicious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best premier episode of any of Treks, and I think Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.
