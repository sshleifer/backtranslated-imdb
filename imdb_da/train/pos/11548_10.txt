Based on Neil Simon's play of the same The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) who end up sharing Oscar's massive undergraduate cushion after Felix tries to kill himself. <br /> <He had a large array of his wife over her obsessive compulsive cleansing and strange phobias and sending her a suicide sticker. She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened. Fillix appears on Oscars during his weekly poker game with their friends Vinnie (John Fielder) Murray police officer (Herbert Edelman) Roy (David Sheiner) and Speed ​​(Larry Haines). After some splitting hysteria, it has been agreed that Felix will stay with Oscar. The rest of the film centers on how these two are so completely different characters. And as good as looking at whether Oscar can stand Felix's weird and unique habits and cleanliness, and if Felix can stand Oscar for being such a slob and his laid-back attitude to everything. Really a movie about two complete contradictions that live together and the joys, heights, descent and necessity of the gift that is friendship. With a great actor an intelligent and very fun script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British dove sisters, whom Oscar invites to a double date. <br /> <br /> This one is guaranteed to make you laugh, every line is priceless, and Jack and Walter are amazing with a fantastic chemistry. Also made for a successful and equally fun television series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix.
