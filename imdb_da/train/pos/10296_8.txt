Really fun Jim Carrey vehicle who has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets God's power and destroys chaos. Carrey is back in familiar soil here and seems to be having a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as her set of girlfriends is also charming and influential. The story is predictably extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the movie worth catching. GRADE: B
