Any child who is old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music of this in-depth and humorous rewrite of Grimm's fairy tales. They sing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can formulate a complete sentence themselves and will continue to sing it to their dying days. It is a classic for all children, especially the adults who are young at heart.
