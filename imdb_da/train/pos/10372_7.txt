ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old kid (well-acted, by the way) who is in football. Malone's cousin takes him out of the night before his big game on a fairy-tale adventure involving two gym bags, a drug master, some tough cyclists, some police and some prostitutes ... and the film keeps us guessing which signs are on which side of the law what the content of either gym bag is and even what sex is a key biker is. Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions that I already had before I saw ROLL. These statements are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a good place for a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in them are Australian. The cinematography in ROLL was particularly impressive. I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are HOT!
