Wonderful film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser, who go together as father and father. <br /> <br /> Father shows one evening to say that after more than 40 years of marriage, mother (Olympia Dukakis) has left him. /> <br /> The rest of the film depicts father and son on a day trip to get the father's thoughts out of what has happened. With them away, the daughters can play detective. <br /> <br /> The story shows father and son's adventures in their discussion of life, what should have been why Mom complained about Dad when discussing their philosophies about life. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing trip and pool game leading to a close fight. Both men seem to break out of their everyday lives. The end is a downer when we learn why mother suddenly left. It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit as opposed to adversity. It is never too late to change.
