Karen enters a Japanese house as a replacement nurse for Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps daytime and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs after hearing sounds when she meets a frightening ghost. She wants to learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! The signs are good. The settings are scary. I love the whole plot! The end was shocking! I stopped at a scene where the little boy met so much to the man that he found his sister upstairs and I was shocked. This is the scariest movie I've seen. I didn't see the Japanese version. I recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
