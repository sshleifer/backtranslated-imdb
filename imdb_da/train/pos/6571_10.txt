<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. The movie begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris, and the family hasn't heard anything. At the same time comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) and tells her exactly where her sister is and makes an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and get a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him around and writes their adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's fun, it's action packed, it's just great. I think it's a cult movie with a very little cult feeling. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws some lines that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as the girl and the side ticket, respectively. John Hurt, the guy who's stomach blew up in the Alien, plays the devilish perverting villian that just adds the fun. In many ways, this movie resembles Indiana Jones, in some ways resembling the James Bond movie. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title is, it's a very enjoyable movie.
