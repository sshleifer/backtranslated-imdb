I simply can't get over how brilliant pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's as if the movie doesn't even need extra characters, because you can never get tired of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon had already been in several famous films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau were fresh from their Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie also with Lemmon). The movie in question was not as big as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). But it is half an hour and a half, although the introduction of events leading up to Lemmon ends in Matthaus's apartment is a bit long (so was this sentence). It is a little haze, and for the rest of the time you have a great time. I've already written a comment on how the follow-up to this movie is sucked, and I won't go deeper into it. The reason why it is such a joy is probably that the film was made, just as the innocence of American films began to fade quickly into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are treated in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a "Well I never ..." out of the most prudent person out there. It's fun to watch a movie from a long lost era, and that's probably why the sequel didn't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon, say a few f-words, and it just doesn't fit them. <Br /> <br /> Of course, they are both gone and you can just be glad you still enjoy them in a great movie like this. I think the only male actor in this movie still living is John Fiedler. Edelman recently died. So there you have it. Just one of the best comedies and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Add: I just learned recently that John Fiedler has died so for all his fans. I am deeply saddened. I didn't mean anything disrespectful, and I'll try to be more careful about what I blah blah next time.
