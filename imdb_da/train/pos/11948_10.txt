"Match Point" and now "Scoop" both convinced me that Woody Allen not only does a nice job of making movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member), but confirmed what I have known for years : He shouldn't focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays journalist students Sondra Pransky, who magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his vanishing box, where she meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued London was committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Then she knows him, and ... I don't know how much I can tell you without giving it away. But I can say that this is probably Allen's most fun movie this year. There is his ubiquitous unique humorous style (especially the line of his religion). So you're sure to like this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But for the most part it's just so amazing fun. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you must love this one.
