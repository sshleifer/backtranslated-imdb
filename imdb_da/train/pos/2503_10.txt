I'm extremely picky about the movies I see. I had heard of Moon Child completely by accident. I've been a fan of L'Arc A Ciel for a time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer recently. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found out that the movie was re-released and picked it up without a different mindset. Being as critical as I am about movies, I will admit that the action scenes may be somewhat hokey at times ... but they are also meant to be as another user suggested, this is the tremendously quiet in front of the storm and quoted Gary Oldman from Leon ... without getting into the spoils, the movie hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless, and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, that is until death is shared. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt provide performances that show why they are able to commit such depth to their lyrics, their passion for music on the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film who comes into one's soul and evokes emotional response. <br /> <br /> By watching the movie for the first time, I realized that it will probably remain in strong rotation as far as my collection goes. I would like to encourage anyone reading this post to download the movie if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in movies ... this takes a whole new direction using classic Yakuza movie elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from Ryo Ishibashi of Takashi Miike's "Audition" and "Suicide Club" fame? <br /> <br /> Man .. I just can't say enough about this movie, but I'm stopping here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
