In 1943, a group of RAF officials, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the yard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account and it started a peculiar British film genre - The Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> The wooden horse is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen. There are no great dramatic moments, but a stable story eventually develops a climax that has more excitement because history does not allow for unlikely drama, cuts or jacked up (somethings to happen!) Music. It is completely out of time and works beautifully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (I suppose) non-actors. Without exception, everyone is constantly monotonous and calm. They keep the feeling out of their roles. As so many were until recently, I have suspected that they were recreating their wartime roles as 'Officers and Gentlemen'. <br /> <br /> This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story does not end with barbed wire: and the fact alone keeps me glued to the end.
