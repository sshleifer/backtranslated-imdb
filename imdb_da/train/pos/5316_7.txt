This is the second movie I have seen by Ida Lupino as an instructor after the 53-year-old. I think one was a better movie than one. This one has a girl who is getting married and she is so sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone watching and talking about her, so she runs away and is taken by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is correct, to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
