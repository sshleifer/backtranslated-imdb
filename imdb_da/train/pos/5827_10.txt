This three stooges flick is in the context of my other favorite flick "Disorder in the Court". This is a cleanup of laughter for any Three Stooges fan to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The boys are watchmen on a recording studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre singing a great version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a record deal, but she is scared to be honest with her father about her career choices and prove herself a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, Stooges chooses to have some fun and play her record and dress up curly up like Christine. Contract lady who can make Christine's career looks Curly and fails him to Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there is a man who has disturbed the party, and they destroy their solo in front of the audience, so he finds a way to get back to them. <br /> <br /> What a great stooge flick, this should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
