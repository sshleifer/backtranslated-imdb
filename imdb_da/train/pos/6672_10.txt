I have seen the Mystery Men police a little stick in the press and with the public (take the imdb voices for example), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, definitely more profound than most so-called comedy films and very close to 'wise'. <br /> <br /> Casting is amazing; Greg Kinnear is excellent, like Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limo scene with Ricky Jay is the perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of cartoon quality and realism to make him work. I will admit that pacing is a bit away in places, and images are certainly very flash bang, possibly detrimental to further characterization, but at the end of the day it is a high concept film production - it's about the little moments "What is Tiger Lily? " - and there are so many good things in this movie that makes it worth repeating the show.
