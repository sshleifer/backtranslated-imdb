You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Witch proved it. This movie supports it. It's no more than a sitcom in length and complexity. But because it has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, it manages to be fun even on a budget that can't afford a shoestring. The highlight of this movie is Arthur Lowe as the sincere, bumbling Watson, his weakness, and the slowness of Cleese's quick whites. If you ever run across the movie, watch it for a quirky laugh or two.
