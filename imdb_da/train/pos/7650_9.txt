Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest Hollywood blockbusters get, but it packs twice the emotional blow. The story is about this one family from Utah, and it is the relationships between the people in the family that give the film its battle. The chief executive (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, leaving no time for him to believe that he is acting all his emotions. It is his brother (Elias Koteas) who, however, stole the show for myself. When the two were in scenes together, they separated their lines from each other and gave amazing performances. Large cast, good movie.
