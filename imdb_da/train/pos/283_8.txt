"The Days" is a typical family drama with a small catch - you have to relate to the character's feelings in every way possible so you can really appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who are Unfamiliar With the Show] The story, of course for all the people who have seen the show, is the world of Cooper Day, the family's middle child. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a genius little brother. The first episode to sound a little silly since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both sister and mother become pregnant. It is the first situation that the author hits. Then the father keeps his work with the law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The middle child comes into battle with the sister's girlfriend. This is all in one day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit crappy, but I like it. At first I thought the camera work was a ripoff, but then I used it and started to like it. I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light. I liked the intimate feel of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the play. I admire the story. Then I find myself another season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of it when the 6 episode on ABC came to an end. It's a really good show, and it's not like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can relate to either Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you like this show. A lot.
