Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I admit I haven't read the book, despite being an avid Agatha Christie fan. The adaptation is not without problems, there were times when humor, and there were safe attempts to get it right, was a little exaggerated, and the events that led to the final solution became a little hasty. I also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded. However, I loved how the Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really set the mood on the dark camera work and dark lighting. The darker moments were somewhat creepy, this was aided by one of the most joking music scores in a Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as the one in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The reason is complex, with all the essential ingredients, but not as horrified as Buckle My Shoe, and somehow it's a good thing. The action was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can't use this word forever, but I can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice for their integrated characters brilliant. And the students had great personalities and well developed on everything, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, solid mystery but not rank along the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
