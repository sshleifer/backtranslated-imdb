First of all, this is really my favorite movie ever. I don't have to give anyone a description because every one ** hole does. I'm literally obsessed with these almost bloodless, cheesy, lame effects that have 'boom-stick shows', poorly edited, 80's metal horror masterpieces. The director (I heard) had hoped for a hit at the cashier's office so he could make successors and have a FREDDY / JASON type of deal for himself. Damn, I wish it could have gone down like that! The soundtrack is banging '. The actor is good .... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and any die-hard fans out there, feel free to email and chat sometime. Midgetorgy .... I can be found at YAHOO.
