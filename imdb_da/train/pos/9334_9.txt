The sensual nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy starring the one-time Bond girl Ursula Andress. The man she was warm in this movie. She was stacked and built as a * @ #% brick house. Ursula is hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse outfit that filled out before. <br /> <br /> Ms. Andress stars as a nurse employed to take care of a rich elderly man. Even one in the house seems to knock the boots. One night, the nurse decides to take the grandchild's temperature and provide some necessary T.L.C. to his old client. The old one goes to his nurse and it attacks the rest of the family. What kind of job did the family carry out to do? Should geezer fall for its owner? How can she deal with the octogenic crown and the rest of the family? To find out, find a copy of SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian but poorly baptized in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
