I've rated this one ten, just because I find it so impressive what an eighteen year old can do with a video camera. It's not epic, but it's very engaging and I never got bored. If tens of thousands of dollars can go into countless bad films that are poured a lot, then give that director the same amount and see what happens. I know I'm going to add to the local cinema for its first major release. Damn good work, and well worth the money. What a script! It can be low budget, but it beats hell out of half the big pictures I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on the screen. Serious kudos to her can't wait to see more.
