This movie is a perfect portrayal of The Nutcracker; the dance is wonderful, the scenery in the background was excellent, and i loved the whistling bed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I especially loved the marzipan, the tutu was sweet. The special effects were very well done (eg the tree, the bed, etc.), and I really enjoyed the rats. I love how they didn't make them scary but sweet and huggable. Except for the king, I assume. <br /> <br /> If you are a thoroughly masculine person, you will not enjoy this but it is a very good movie that is good for all ages - just not all levels of testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have a few complaints. First, why should they put Sugar Plum Fairy's partner in the terrible tights? It would hardly make a difference if he was robbed naked! And secondly, why at EARTH should they make Culkins outfit PINK?
