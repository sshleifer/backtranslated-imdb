I've seen all the movies directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love for the American people and the country. In a river running through it, Redford shows the lyrical romance and visual splendor of the high rocks of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This movie loves the visual and the word with the text of author Norman Maclean, and fantastic camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Orm's Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt, create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems that everyone faces with growing teenage sons and later complex youth men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are completely credible as the brothers, whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationship between men, father and sons, brothers and their wives to the outside world, for reasons. A river runs through it to a storytelling that is lacking in so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships special is the attention Redford gives to language as said in dialogue. This is a literary script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when combined with the amazing Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting correspond to the notions of a cast that rise to their material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange entity to center a story, it's not so incredible in Redford's direct hand. Considering the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth regaining again and again.
