If you love kung-fu movies and you haven't seen this movie, you're cheating yourself. This movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that can be recommended for fans of all types of movies. Usually it takes a deadly fan of the genre to see something in these movies, but this one has it all! The story is well told and complete. The battle scenes are great and tend to end before you are completely upset (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself a heck of a movie. See this at all costs. Heck, my wife enjoyed it herself. <br /> <br /> Wu You! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
