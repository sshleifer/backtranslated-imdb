There are movies and there are movies. Movies are more often than not just cinematic "candy", while movies are true works of art. Fraulein Doctor is certainly well placed in the latter. Like most viewers, I was extremely impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the central character is what I consider to be the most sterile quality of the movie. Having made every effort to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, he becomes mortal from the German High Command despite all his efforts. The scene where Doctor is transported on the back seat of a Mercedes Benz Command, alone, desolate and insidious, is perhaps one of the most boring, but truest, depictions of a "spy" party in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in Spy Who came in from Kolden comes close. Fraulein Doctor is a much deeper film than one can realize a unique view. I would only wish its producers would see it appropriate to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again) enjoy this extraordinary movie.
