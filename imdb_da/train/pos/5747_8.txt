If you have any kind of heart and compassion for humans, it is a hard movie to see, at least in the second half of it. <br /> <br /> It is in the segment where we see a good baby being turned up, and then a delayed (mentally challenged) man goes out of the deep end after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It is not comfortable material. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie and the play is also good. The story will sit with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is the mentally handicapped guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this can be Hula's best role ever. He was watched by a fellow student, "Eugene", played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams." Dominick is a kind-hearted garbage bin that reads "Hulk" comics and loves wrestling. He is the type of "slow" guy you can't help but love and ruddy to live a good life. When he freaks out, it is for several good reasons and ... well, watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go on the real emotional slide and possibly be very sorry for some things you see.
