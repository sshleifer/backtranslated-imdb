I was pleasantly surprised I liked this movie. Witty writing (some "inside" jokes I got, others I did not - perhaps due to actors talking to each other), great actors (especially John Cassini), amazing cameos, interesting and unique directions. I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was in that short time, flashing and you will miss him!) But found the movie remarkably entertaining. I actually want to see it again before sending back to Netflix. I think actors and will-actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie. The end is expected something, but wants them to have done something else (and more positively). Too bad the movie was not better received except at the "festival" market. I suggest it to anyone who loves the actor biz.
