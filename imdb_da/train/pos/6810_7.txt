After reading the book, I came across this DVD at Wal-Mart for 3 bucks and certainly thought what the hell ... I got the DVD and saw it last night. When I started to see it, I checked the running time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought it was cool ... It seemed to run pretty slowly, knowing the story and how much there was. When I got to the actual killings, I was like, "how much time has it left?" Controlled. "One minute? What the hell?" I felt incredibly cheated and thought that the movie only progressed through one third of the overall story. <br /> <br /> But then I was happy to note that the DVD's scene selection menu included part 1 and part 2. I still had another half hour to go! I sat so happily and enjoyed the other half of the movie, even more than the first. I admit that I have not seen the original film from 1967 (despite my sincere desire), I did read the short story and felt this was a pretty descent movie, for a two-part television miniseries, that is. I think the casting of Perry's role was completely wrong, and a few minor inconsistencies jumped at me, but still very well done. The first half draws a little while the other half is much more gripping. I think they should have proportioned the movie more like Capote did his book: 1/3 before the killings, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the killers were arrested. Instead, the film makes it more 1/2 before the murders, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. Again, this makes the other half more exciting, but at the same time less convincing, while the first half pulls on and off ... Now I look back and realize that I just made the same mistake of getting things going on and on again, So I shut up hell. Go see the movie and make your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
