I can't stop saying how much I loved this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The film follows the exploitation of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it is tragically broken. After the group is documentary producer Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The movie is on a shoestring budget, but it doesn't look like it's a very well-made, well-produced movie, and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this movie is the writing, there are so many brilliant lines and the start of rap in this movie, it is unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> The actual rappers are starting, like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey Taste and Songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick , Etc.) Rusty Condieff made an excellent movie. In the movie he plays rapper Ice Cold. The movie doesn't stop, it's fun from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well because it gets random, but it hits the line where it's fun without going too far out there. Listening to the three leaders trying to speak a kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie that Tone Def tells a record company when you take the bus, you get there and the producer responds ?? it is deep! '<br /> <br /> The group portrays NWH has some kind of natural chemistry for them. They work so well together and they are able to pull this movie to where there is not a week's moment in the movie. What really makes this movie so good is so true for some of the rap groups of the time this movie is. Many rap groups had problems with violence, with censors, and like the NWA, the group became popular only when the establishment began to make a large part of the controversial texts. I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way. The film has a start on a good number of people also outside rap, the most fun being by Spike Lee. Where they came up with this dialogue, I can't imagine. The film has line by line, which makes you roll on the floor. As I said before, writing is just amazing. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this movie met such limited release. It is an intelligent, controversial and even thought-provoking film. This is too much for the mainstream, despite being fun and almost flawless in its production. There are no big stars, but many well-known faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you'll definitely have an opinion about it.
