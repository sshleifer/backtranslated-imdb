The movie caught from start to finish, and its b / w photography of the American heartland is amazing. We feel that we are right there with them as they cross the vast sky country and then to Mexico and back to America again. At the end of the film, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down the face. Finally, we follow them up the stairs to their last minute. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, like Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, could be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most dizzying, is part of the human condition. These two savage men kill a whole family and are looking for a safe one who is not there. When on the run, they start writing bad checks and training a track to the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many fine supporting players. I like John Forsyth as a detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Will Geer also shines on a short but excellent scene as the prosecuted lawyer. <br /> <br /> I have often wanted to watch this movie all the way through, just capturing it in short snatches; I finally came to it after purchasing the DVD. The result is the finest classic crime movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this amazing movie. For me, this is what is a great film production.
