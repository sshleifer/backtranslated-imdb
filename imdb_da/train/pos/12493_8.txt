After all the shot that Hollywood (and the Indians) have churned out, we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure it is possible today to make a completely original movie. There's not much new here ... it's just been good. <br /> <br /> Make sure and pay attention as the "subtle" scares come fast and often. This is not a movie to watch while eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very well-written red herring in this movie and unfortunately a very bad cast role. Cheri Christian just doesn't make an effective Julie (the wife / mother). For one thing, she is completely unsympathetic. I know I know ... she's just gone through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows her as "normal" and the relationship between her and her husband is quite uncomfortable (in an unintentional way). I think the director meant to us a little sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumb up to the end, which both disturbs and satisfies. It could easily have been cheap with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credit, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good old-fashioned scary movie ... something quite rare today.
