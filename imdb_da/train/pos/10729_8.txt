Some summer camp camps were actually randomly sent into the room by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was shorter. They had to send someone to a space station to get gas tanks etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie's plot is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling that everything is possible if you put your heart in it. It's great to see the young actors still looking the same after so many years. (I watched this movie for the first time in the year 2000, it was filmed in 1986). There are a lot of people in the movie still working in Hollywood. The view was fantastic from outer space. It doesn't seem to be unreal. It's about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you won't even notice. You know it's not right, but you just get sucked into it to the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
