This is one of the smallest episodes, because the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. BUT I appreciated this light hearted approach and it is truly one of the best episodes to look at at a purely fun level. Think about it - the crew members meet the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight riding killer who kills McCoy, and a host of other apparently bizarre events that just don't make anyone sense it all until the end. Despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously - it's just fun, and the whole episode seems very surreal. So on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's good things.
