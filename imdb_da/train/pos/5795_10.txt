This movie is my all time favorite !!! You really need to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I am always over the moon and see it !! This is a movie that you really have to see, even if you are not a MJ Fan, because this film writes, like Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little movie and music story !! This wonderful movie, out of Michael's feathers, is a must !! And: Smooth Criminal, is really the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet, he is a fine man, and he always brings sparkle in your eyes when you listen to his music !! If you do not know this movie, watch it and miss it because it would be too bad for yourself if you would miss it !! -Highly recommended movies, for each movie lover-
