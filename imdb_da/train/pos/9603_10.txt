I have a word to download this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater talked. This film shows the difficulties Darius is suffering from with muscular dystrophy. The movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie. I was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be wholesome, some people in this world are less excellent than us. And at times we should give them a hatred and help them, ultimately. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius a hatred when they were not asked, they did not do for the money they made it a distressing one, Darius, the world should know Darius went west.
