BASEketball is actually a really fun movie. David Zucker manages to make us laugh our heads again, in a really stupid but many times smart comedy. <br /> <br /> The two creators of South Park, the main actors in this movie, play very well, surprisingly well indeed, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The film often reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows. It's a really good and fun movie, so don't miss it. Voice: 7.5 out of 10.
