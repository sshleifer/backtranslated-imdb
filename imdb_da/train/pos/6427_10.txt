If you're in the mood for fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... both Miyan Chote Miyan is one of those movies to watch. Amitabh started quite well ... but it's Govinda who steals the show from his hands ... great timing for and good dialogue delivery ..... it's inspired by bad boys ... but it has Indian Masala for it. .. people think it can be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan leads and Govinda works ... shouldn't raise questions .... other recommended movies in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) .. are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie No. 1, Iodine No. 1, Hero No. 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
