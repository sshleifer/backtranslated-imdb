This James Bond game is the best bondage game I've played in my life, it's my favorite James Bond game so far, because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are really fun, they can be very tough That makes it more fun to play the missions has lots of actions the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are awesome, the car's missions have lots of action and are really fun to play. Voice over the actors is really good, and it's cool that Sean Connery makes James Bond's voice the way bonding looks, is really cool because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in the movies and the other character looks pretty much the same as the look of the movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. Also, the game follows the movie pretty much, but not all, but most of the time does, which is cool. <br /> <br /> overall score ********** out of ***** *****
