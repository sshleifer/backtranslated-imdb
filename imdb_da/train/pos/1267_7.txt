Just cause is a flawless but decent movie that is held together by strong performances and something creative (though very predictable) to write. Sean Connery is a crime against the death penalty brought in to rescue an apparently innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the final punishment. To put things right, Connery goes into the crime scene, where he not only has to pass with time, but a fake sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Reversals and reverse roles are superfluous - some surprising, some not - as the aging crusader tries to solve the mystery. The climaxing end is a bit ridiculous, but just cause is worth looking at a slow night.
