Tony Scott can make great movies and bad, I personally think he can be a little flashy and trashy, and his work obviously suffers from that of his closest famous brother, but that's probably his best movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that Scott gives Denzel (burning, better than training day) and revelation who Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship with true warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it involves and takes us on a small journey into the characters - including a great role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. It all serves to make the action so much more effective as we are so invested in the signs of all their overly obvious weaknesses. This movie has you on the edge in its entirety, and neither is it at the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie wouldn't be anything without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many pigeon roles when he is clearly as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who today has more power on the screen). This movie should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance and the quality of the movie. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't go back to a movie to the hilt, it stops going directly to video. I wish I had the chance to see this on the big screen.
