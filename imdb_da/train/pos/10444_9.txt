Sweet and charming, fun and poignant, plot less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third movie by Richard Linklater, is dedicated to anyone who has ever been in love, in love or never in love, but still dreams of and hope to find it. It is one of the very rare films that is / should / will be as interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems like a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car lights or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke returning after the summer in Europe and French student Julie Delpy, going to Paris to attend classes in the Sorbonne) meet on a train. They attract each other immediately, even before they start talking, they jump off the train in Vienna, where they go around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's what it is the movie. It could have been boring and stupid, but instead it is a lovely, trustworthy, smart and moving romance that only gets better with each view (at least for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and the authors to deliver two charming characters, great writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two amazing performances and magical atmosphere that fall in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli angel, is great at portraying smart, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
