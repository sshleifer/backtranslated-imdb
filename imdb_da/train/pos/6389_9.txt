Passing stones surely one of the best movie-independent movies ever. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this. This movie for some reason has not received its credit due. First we start with the story that everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters behind to advise on a hidden treasure, it not only brings two families together, but starts a whirlwind adventure. Mix in a Polish translator, a comatose mother, a kink head with a tower syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist and a dragon queen, money not only makes the world around but can make the family enemies. My favorite character in this movie was to be the sister / crack addict with the tower's syndrome, her sudden outbreak makes you cry and mimic for weeks.
