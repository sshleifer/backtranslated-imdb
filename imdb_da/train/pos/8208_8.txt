I liked almost all the movies in the Dirty Harry series except for the one I think is the title "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was also a little weak in areas, but I still enjoyed it. This is one of my favorites in the series if nothing else for the big line of "Go ahead, make my day". This one also has an interesting, albeit known plot by someone who kills those who have made her wrong. Just think "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. Granted there is a little more than that, as this has a very nice final showdown at an amusement park. It also has Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift, and Sandra Locke stumbles into a rather humorous scene. The only question left is why Clint Eastwood should have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his films. She brings the score down one point every time, even when in general the movie is enjoyable for me. Granted she's not bad here, but her character might have been so much better off another. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, at times they almost seem to be advertisements for weapons. I like cannons as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes from him that explain all the different strengths of his latest weapon and how many bullets it holds? Still, very nice entry into the Dirty Harry series of movies.
