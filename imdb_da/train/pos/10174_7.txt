This was another World War II announcement to the soldiers and the Allies to be cautious about spreading rumors. These were called "instructional" cartoons because it was a mix of serious messages along with a fun protagonist called "Pvt. Snafu." <br /> <br /> We all have performances with fear and what do you have, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu wrongly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with "five". You can start panic and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. It involves losing confidence in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. It is still being done today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," declares a great baloney near the end of this cartoon. Great how some Americans still haven't learned. This cartoon can be 65 years old, but it certainly has relevance today. As I write this, there were two terrorist bombs in Europe today, and some people still believe that the "war on terror" is just a bumper slogan. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The author, the famous "Dr. Suess," uses analogies of "hot air balloon juice" here to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name), you know that the rhymes will be wise. <br /> <br /> Nothing hilarious here, but it wasn't supposed to be. You need to understand the climate of 1943 and the legitimate paranoia out there during World War II. People forget that the war could easily be closed with the other side winning. It was a tense time
