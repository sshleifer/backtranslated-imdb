Certain elements of this film are of course dated. An all white male herd, for example. And like most Pre-Star Wars Science Fiction, it tends to take too long to admire. <br /> <br /> But no movie has ever caught the taste of Golden Age Science Fiction as it did, even down to the use of the "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. Robbie the Robot designated the Asimov robots and was the inspiration for everything that came from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> Of course, the basics are Shakespeare's "The Tempest". Morbius is Prospero and the exile guide who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers ... It was a movie that dealt with Science Fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
