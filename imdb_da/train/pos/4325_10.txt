This version of Bleak House is the best fit of a classic novel known to me. The representation of the Chancery Court as a "sign" in the drama is magnificent. The action is fantastic, from the creepy Tulkinghorn, to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte, and the two young lovers. But it is the spider's web of chancery that holds it all together and the cinematography is amazing. What error has the BBC made about copyright, which meant that this version could not be seen in the UK on either video or DVD for many years? I tried to figure them out, but faced a stone wall. Eventually I got a DVD copy from Canada.
