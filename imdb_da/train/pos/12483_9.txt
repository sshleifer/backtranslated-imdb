Even though I was in this movie playing that part of Sheriff Hodges, I still managed to jump over and believe me, I'm not that easy. You might say I'm biased about the movie, and OK, I'm, but I didn't see finished product until 12/27/2006 and was extremely pleased. I'm not a Horror movie fan as such but love the old "B" movies and black and white Sci Fi movies. This movie will make you "think" you know when something is going to happen, so don't, then do it. It will keep you completely out of balance. I would suggest watching the movie first and then the director's notes and special features. It is so well written, directed and filmed, and I can tell you personally that it was a real pleasure to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
