But how can you stand for many a baseball team that can't win. For George Knox, it's not easy. As the film opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) ride on their bikes around the Angels stadium. When they return to their nursing home, Roger is surprised to visit his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they become a family again, he goes with jokes "I say when the angels win the division fight" Then later Roger and J.P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When the manger George Knox (Danny Glover) takes his jug out, the jug gets sour and comes in a fight with him, and soon the angelic team gets into the game, which gets the Knox draft from the game. That night, Roger makes a prayer, because the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP go to a baseball, Roger sees real angles on the pitch and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) make a catch that leaves crib and play-by-play man (Jay. O Sanders) how did he do it. Roger learns from the main angel (Christopher Lloyd) that he can only see the angles because he was the only one who asked for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
