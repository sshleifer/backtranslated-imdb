Dirty Sanchez is the more extreme British version of Jackass, where the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go in great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason why this show is better than Jackass is because most stunts are not scheduled, making the reaction much more fun. There are 3 series of the show, the first following them around and taking a long look at their lives eg. There is an episode about their love life, jobs, etc. The second series sends the boys to try different professions. The third follows their European tour. It seems that the boys are becoming more and more daring as the show progresses through the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say if you have a stomach's stomach, DO NOT see, as you can easily see a lot of blood and brush in every episode.
