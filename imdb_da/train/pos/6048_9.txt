What class bit of British cinema! It's about time. And a side splitting comedy to start! <br /> <br /> Anyone seeking to revive a bit of freedom from their misunderstood youngsters will prove this roadmap. <br /> <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail" and I "and" Easy Rider. "The movie is running at a steady pace and doesn't let you slip too long ... Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are well-grounded and add the characters the actors portray, I was a little worried about Phil Daniel's character at first, but fortunately I was won over halfway in what was one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie "In general, I found myself belly laughing through the movie probably annoying some people around me. Oh yes. I would thoroughly recommend it. This will be a cool British comedy. Worth a visit."
