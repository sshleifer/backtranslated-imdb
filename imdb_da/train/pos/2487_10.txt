I must say, seeing Hamlet from a student's perspective, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to being true to the original text must be applauded. It helps the game live on-screen and makes it easier for people who keep the text while watching, as we did while studying it, following and analyzing the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things I've heard criticized many times is the casting of big Hollywood names in the play. I find this helps viewers recognize the characters more easily, as opposed to having actors who all look and look like the one who helps in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Also, his flashbacks help clear up many ambiguities in the text. Like how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went, and why Fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. All in all, this version does not contain fantastic performances by actors who are both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that you do not need to be an English literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it.
