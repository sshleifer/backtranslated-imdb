The film is based on Kipling's heroic lines that inspire Hollywood's greatest movie in 1939. Out of Kipling's drumming rhythm, the most famous 85 lines are a picture that will be known as the year's biggest movie. Just at his army's score in battle, its war elephants, its bandit hordes, its terror temple Thugs and mysterious mountains in India. The image is still larger in scale and sweep, is excitement and action, but most of all in life breathes through three (Gary Grant, Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) roaring, ruthless, dizzying sons of the thundering gunfighters men who fight its powerful scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure. It's an honest movie of all that makes Gunga Din a new entertainment experience. Joan Fontaine gambled her against the brave sergeant three. The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr. aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror in a country where something can happen. The movie has tensions for a thousand movies looted for a mighty show. It is a fabulous, furious and far removed adventure with the red-blooded and reptile heroes rising from India's great mystery and storming the screen with the hilarious, robust lifetime of men who fight for love for it and love for the fun of it . The pictures are interpreted for the brave and rogue Gary Grant, who rounded out a hundred villains Thugs and the average Guru (Eduardo Ciannelli), shouts Grant: You are arrested! Except the heroic jailer, Sam Jaffe, as Regiment Colonel (Montagu Love) says about him: You are a better man than I am, swinging yours!
