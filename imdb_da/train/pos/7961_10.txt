"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of the wonderful old movies on domestic animals. Deserve a place among the big movies in its genre and even the cinema world in general along with other animal films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". That means it's more than just a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Could this be just a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know this one of my heart since my early teens (when I was 12). It's a family movie to treasure. It is emotionally, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, cordial and sometimes dramatic. It is one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks qualities. It has a well thought out story, fun characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtracks, dazzling scenes / landscapes in the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). Talking about the prospects, not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... in conclusion, all pure wonders of nature - truly a full panorama. <br /> <br /> The most important human figures are fine, well-developed and well portrayed by their respective actors. Robert Hays is great as the friendly heart, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as the youngest and sweet brother Jamie (his appearance really reminds me of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is fantastic as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our quadruped friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the loyal, clever, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever (splendidly pronounced by Don Ameche). Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatient, eager, clumsy, funny and loves to play (pronounced by the talented Michael J. Fox). Chance just can't stand still. Sassy is the epitome of the cat's image: elegant, independent, very confident and independent proud, with a typical cat setting, but with a certain cat rod. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy Field's voice, which also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are even great "actors" by nature: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's an underestimated movie, but a classic alone. Its successor is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the Top 250.
