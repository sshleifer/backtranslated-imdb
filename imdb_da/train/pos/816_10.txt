First of all, I would like to say that while I know my share of star wars, I'm not fanatical. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. What I know is this: Star wars, all movies (less with episode 2 itself), caught something magical. It's hard to say what button Lucas has found and pushed boldly, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. That's an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I'll explain. The Star Wars touches the most universal of stereotypes, good vs. evil. It makes it so naturally so deep that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI reveals much more than the hinted back story, and the final epic battle between a son and his used and manipulated father, but also with the addition of the precursors. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader on the cover, and viewers realize it's the story of Anakin, not just Luke. But even before 1-3 there was an incredible depth for everything. It felt right as if the capsule fell from heaven into Lucas's lap and detailed a historical tale of a galaxy far away. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is certainly far above the norm and I must admit when I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel like I have been pushed into a world where good and evil is so clearly defined. I get a tingling sensation when I see them, a feeling that something has somehow touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope for.
