Hamlet is by far my favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is a heck of an actor. His portrayal of this was just amazing. His soliloquier was breathtaking. As long as it was, it is rare that a movie keeps my interest, but I was confused in this piece. I recommend it to anyone both fan Shakespeare and those not so much. This has everything the modern world looks for in its films: murder, fraud and fraud. Not knocking Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole work. This leaves no stone unchanged. When you finish the movie, it will feel like you are reading the game yourself. About how to say "two thumbs up".
