I entered Deathtrap expecting a well-organized and exciting thriller; and while that is something this movie is; I can't help but think it's just a poor man's Sleuth. The classic film from 1972 is of course an inspiration for this film; Not particularly in relation to the plot, but this is certainly the case with the performance. Casting Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a piece by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest game bombs, Sidney finds himself low; and this is not helped when a game is called Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught arrives outside the door. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins to undress his own plot; which involves inviting the amateur writer to kill him and then transfer Deathtrap as his own work. Despite all its clever twists; Deathtrap falls on a primary element, and that is the sign. The movie fails to give a single sympathetic character, and it's very hard to worry about the story when you don't rotate to any of the players. This is not helped by the actor. Michael Caine puts a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but no one else prides himself. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possible funny sign disgusting with an honest annoying performance. It is fortunate when history is good; And it's just about saving the movie. The reason has lots of turns; Some work better than others, but there is always enough to ensure that the film remains interesting. Director Sidney Lumet also deserves some credit, as the movie's style is another big plus. The central location is interesting in itself, and the film cabinet fits the film well. Overall, I must admit that I enjoyed this movie; but it could have been much, much better.
