This movie surprised me. Some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith. But mostly very entertaining-good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (give some comic relief). This is a movie you can see again - say ... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value.
