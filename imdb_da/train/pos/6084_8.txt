I was happy with the thrown of recognized players. The story is one of standing up for a reason, even if you are in personal risk of doing so. At a time when violence and pain are often in the forefront of the film, this film focuses on the old-fashioned good policeman. Although similar plot has been made repeatedly, these guys pull it off well. Kick back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master for taking over a movie.
