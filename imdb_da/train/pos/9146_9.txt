This electrifying musical has more than one wing of selfishness from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The movie is 90 minutes, but truly it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic. Like other movies centered around the struggling young musician trying to be great, this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the music tracks. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, it is entertaining nonetheless, and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of things, the story of Kid (Prince) centers on a young artist and regular place at a club. The owner of the club is frustrated by the kid's arrogance, and little by little about the child that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival. A page that Kids parents have trouble with his father abusing her profusely. During the film, Kid learns a few lessons in life and learns to appreciate his friends more. It is all we have seen in dramas in nature, but it is combined as a musical, a very stylized musical. The prince is actually pretty good at the drama side when he doesn't hit a bag. He seems human and relational. Clarence Williams is also very good as the abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Prince's sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> However, the main force of the movie is the amazing soundtrack. The musical tracks are well-staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, albeit very eccentric. When inspired, he is great, but at the back, he will often make songs that are exclusively for his own taste, and at times his experiments may miss fire, but it is the same for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack for this movie is excellent, however, with only Sexshooter as a weak point. The view of Purple Rain is standby though. It's one of my all-time favorite songs. *** <br /> <br />
