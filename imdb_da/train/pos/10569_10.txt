Clear, gritty, witty, fast, sexy, extravagant, sleazy, erotic, cordial and corny, the Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment that the movies are all about. The realistic, satirical treatment gives a new edge to the material, and the pace and line delivery are breathtaking. To think that they only started to make function that spoke pictures 7 years before this! The brilliance of dialogue cannot be matched everywhere today, especially considering that "realism" has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was made at a time when the Hayes code limited content was ignored and the result is a fresh, self-reflecting, critical and vibrant cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering from the depression and the general anxiety of age. I would recommend watching movies from this period, that is, 1930-1935, for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be.
