This is the first to watch movies I've seen in the last year! It's fun, incredibly original, incredibly beautiful (they went to this super-cool Technicolor look that's great to watch), and it actually has depth in character and in society. It's really smart satire that nails everything from Homeland Security to race issues while allowing you to laugh and realize how much the world is living in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comedy show I never thought would come from her! She is sweet, fun and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can only laugh and groan! And Dylan Baker's father is invaluable. In fact, the entire casting is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend (get the idea now?) Fun but provocative and just amazing! Go watch this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
