I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels, because the manuscript is always different from the novel. Luckily I was wrong! The play was very close to the novel (I think it helps that the author was an executive producer and author, huh?) Cast is excellent. I can't describe how much I enjoyed seeing so many different actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The location ... I was expecting to see the houses and cabins I imagined in my mind: What I saw on the screen was a little different. However, it was not enough to make me habits of the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who has read the novel: You will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
