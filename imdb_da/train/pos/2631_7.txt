If The Lion King is a serious story of a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, The Lion King is 1 and a half the total opposite, full of whimsy and cheers. Lion King told the story of Simba the young lion. The half is from Timone and Pumbaa's sight, a less than perfect duo consisting of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has an odor problem. The film is a little short on substance, but Disney does a good job of filling up time with various sketches with Timone and Pumbaa as they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is the sing-along that happens halfway through the movie, be sure to see the bouncing error! Disney has announced 1 and a half as "the rest of the story," although it really is not. It's just another perspective of The Lion King, without all the serious stuff that penetrated most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their voting, without their efforts, the movie may not have worked. Song they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
