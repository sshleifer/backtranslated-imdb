While I was initially reluctant to jump on the band watching "Lost", I accidentally took an episode in early season 1 ?? the one with polar children ?? And I have had my individual attention ever since. The view, that is. Not the polar bear. So carry (heh) with me while I throw out so much wandering, semi-cohesive praise that I can muster. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people crashing into a desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unexpectedly? what drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island, on which they are stranded, acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they run away from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or come into contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But "Lost" also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors it houses ... and they all look strange. While television actors are not even known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of "Lost" is in fact spectacular actors for their respective parts, spreading heart and humor in their performances. There are also a lot of eye cakes, but not generally of the plastic Hollywood kind like most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are very convincing to see. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive) ?? These people are primarily trying to survive, and whatever happens, is treated secondary to action. The realism of these figures facilitates an already well-sculpted plot. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Imagine a tree like the template plot, so the branches as subplots (in this case a branch for each character)? Well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then small twigs to the twigs like other story lines. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters in flashbacks, you get your own story. If you are a dog, you have your own story. Unless the authors manage to weave them all together in a brilliant culmination at last, they set themselves up. I'm more than a little worried, there will be some disappointing cop-out for this show, since I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> However, assuming the authors pull this out, "Lost" may be the best show ever to hit TV. <br /> <br /> 9/10
