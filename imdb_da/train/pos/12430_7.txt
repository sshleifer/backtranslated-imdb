Normally, I don't see action movies because of the fact that they are usually all very similar. This movie had many stereotype action movie scenes, but the characters and originality of the film's premise made it much easier to see. David Duchovny bent his normal working approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie was of course beautiful and made great plays. Big thrown together. A must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
