Ever since I heard about the Ralph Bakshi version of "Lord of the Rings" I wondered: What the hell is the "rotoskop" animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this movie three years ago not having any idea who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked it ... very ... Very good storyline .. It even has a small character development that is great for a cartoon ... See it if you're bored with modern animation .... Don't make me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon. .. It is also a really good movie ...
