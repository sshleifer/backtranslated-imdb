I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting and even a token girl. It does not stand out in any of these things, except the cars. A little shot, a little fight, a little smooching around, and LOTs of car, with a big chase near the end. The hope you might say is impractical, but according to our good friends here at IMDB it is possible, so the film is not as bad as people paint it. It has some quality and I liked to see it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I didn't have to turn off my brains to see it. I didn't always think "Is it possible?" or tramp like that. 9 out of 10
