Certainly one of the best British movies ever made, if not one of the best movies ever made anywhere. Script, filmography, direction and action in a class alone. This movie works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never shown on TV? Why is it hidden away when it regularly appears at the National Film Theater in London for packed houses?
