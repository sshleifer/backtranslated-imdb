Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a master class in acting / director / film / editing / writing. I was too young to see it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it has clearly been the time test and I've seen it several times since. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the exciting performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still feel good every time Voight flashes one of his innocently painful looks, or Hoffman coughing in its sick and vicious way to the amazing filmography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that several of our modern filmmakers are not prepared to risk making films that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight cowboy must be required viewing at all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
