I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a couple. What victims have they made to live life on their own terms. This is not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. It is kind of a history lesson and a documentary film rolled into one and combined with an entertaining cinema cinema. The action was superior to everything, and we really get a glimpse of the difficulties these two sisters went through for many years. Both sisters are completely different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family with high, perhaps even impossible, standards of perfection. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to let his daughter continue to see her girlfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I thoroughly recommend this movie and I'm glad I caught it on television the other day.
