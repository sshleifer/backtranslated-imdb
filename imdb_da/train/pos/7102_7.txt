Other reviewers here seem to think it's a horrible movie. It is simply not true and somewhat unfair. The action is of good quality and the direction proceeds with a decent fluidity. I do not think there is anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together. Maybe it's just a new tool for executives to try. I thought it made the movie much more interesting. Maybe a few elements in the script should be tight, but it's about the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance like Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is great and worth the price of admission alone.
