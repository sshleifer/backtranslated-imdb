Above her dead body was a nice little movie. It was decent and entertaining while still being quite fun. There were a couple of clich√©s, but I found most things fresh. At first I didn't think it would be good at all when it started. If you can get past the first 20 minutes, but the movie is becoming more interesting. This film was not blown out in laughter, and it was not OH MY GOSH wonderful. It was just a movie where you can sit down and enjoy how fun it was. I can't see how this movie was bad. It's the rating is just a little too low. I could have treated a 5.5, but a 4.8? Also giving this movie a 1 is shameful. It was pretty good and there was nothing terrible enough to give it a 1, which is what most people gave it.
