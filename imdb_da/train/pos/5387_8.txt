Even in the 21st century, childbearing is dangerous: women are careless and premature. Seventy years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during birth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult case" department of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought from prison (which crime she committed is not German to the plot) to feed; She is in conflict with the fact that she will have to give her baby up after birth. She is in a department with several other women who share their joys and pains with each other. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the lead, Glenda Farrell is the usual accomplishment. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s and admittedly appeared as part of the role, and sometimes became a leader in B-movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several sections of "Torchy" B-movies Here, Farrell plays an expected mother who does not want her children, as they only get in the way. She does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including the smuggling of spirits in the ward (this of course in the day of the ban) and drinking like a fish - apparently they had never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s. Interestingly, unlike most movies from the early 1930s, it is not the women who are blistering idiots who get in the way of the heroic men - this situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers moving on high jelly. (Look for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "Life begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair melodrama pop, but it's a pretty charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it, though rarely; I have only seen it coming up in a few days to honor Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to see when it appears.
