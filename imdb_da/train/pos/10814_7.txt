Given the opposite circumstance in 2009, where reality is that we have a black president, this film takes a rather strong historical significance. For entertainment value, I found this movie to be both engaging and contradictory. Of course, I was taken back by the obvious racism of the time, but also found the music and dance incredible. It is also quite cold to see Sammy Davis Jr. as such a very young actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy who is comforted by his Mammy. He is told 'why today you can be president'. It was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be loving, charming and fun. The majority of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be if it was run by a black man. They depict the state's seats as a revivalist Baptist church. <br /> <br /> The fact was when I stumbled on this movie one day, it took me in. It is very well done and very entertaining. I think if we can look beyond racism, we can see this movie for all that brings us. In fact, to realize that having a black president is not only ridiculous, but that it is normal, just makes this movie much more relevant. It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
