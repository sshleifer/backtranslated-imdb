I remember watching this movie, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next time. I was amazed at how much they could fit into an 8 minute card. We start at a school place. . Two friends discussing on jump class. Kid B says to Kid A "Let's not go to class today." And Kid A falls and claims they can miss something really important. So kid B jumps and kids A goes to class. When he gets there, the teacher informs him that today they should learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They should learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a booklet, and when she comes to child A, she runs out and tells that the boy next to him shares. Well, the child does not share, so Kid A is looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation about what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone see this card. It only takes 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important it can help you with a lifetime.
