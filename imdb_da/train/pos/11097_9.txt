Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I watched a local film critic, this movie was in a 10:00 report blaming the news I wanted to see. I can't remember who it was or what local Omaha news scan brought the review, but the critic was very insistent that this movie was too blunt for the average church nebraska. They showed an excerpt from the scene where John Glover is kidnapping Ann-Margret as she swims in the pool. Glover's character comments on how clever her body is and so on, using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. I was hooked. However, there was a problem. I was only 13 years old and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable. Let's just say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If ever there was a guilty pleasure from me, this movie is it. Calling this movie is fun a huge understatement. The film is centered on a successful businessman who is harassed by three small-scale wallets after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as efficient as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself in the spotlight for three great villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags all the time. He is fun, fun at times and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there is Robert Trebor's (lovely name, by the way!), Character Leo, who is evident over his head with this blackmail scheme. He is a brilliant, sweating, feud that runs a peep show place with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a brooding sociopath who is all scared for good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call, he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the first shock to understand what he is up against, Scheider switches the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation, that is, until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is played out brutally, with almost the whole cast being shot, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I love this movie so much. It really should creep me out, but it doesn't. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting, and the story takes a lot of chances, which most movies today would never try. It is scary to think that the adult film industry is likely to have more than a few characters that Glover's runs around in L.A. looking for problems. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me cry. "Hey sports, have a good day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of shootouts, cool cars, good dialogue (like the line in my opening statement) and decent acting. Lots of cameos of real pornstars. Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chickens in a party scene at Glover Place. <br /> <br /> Another thing to add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta just got married to Kelly Preston. Yum! We can also see that Vanity gets naked for some time before she became a born Christian again. And Ann-Margret. What more can you say about her, except that she is the shining American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Then the dog says. <br /> <br /> Added Feb 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
