This is the best movie version of Dick's classic story. I have seen it over and over at VHS and recently acquired the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not wide screen). What I find interesting about this telecom is cast by English actors who are now recognizable as many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "Equalizer", as Ghost of Christmas Present .
