Diego Armando Maradona was, and still is, the best football player the game has offered. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documentary, if the World Cup of 1986 will always live in the memories of any football fan all over the world. Because of his huge and incredible goals he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no point in reducing this star. Although I am not investigating Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine narrator. He actually cries of happiness and can hardly express his feelings ..... All I wrote can be meaningless and hard to understand, but readers ..... you have to see this to know what I mean.
