Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in a room with a passionate Irish thief in the Father's name, a monstrous, violent butcher in the Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the pianist) and as the scandalous Cristy Brun with cerebral palsy in my left foot (to name just a few). His roles influence each other, but each is separate and completely unique. He changes completely with every character he assumes. And I start to believe that he can act as something. Everything. <br /> <br /> Like Cristy Brown, he's great. He does not ridicule the character and he does not apologize for the character. A difficult performance. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. <br /> <br /> In spite of small scene transition errors and the like, this movie is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No, I laughed. I cried. Not a moment with cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. My favorite scene is the stage in the restaurant when Cristy discusses painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here is where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches a spectacle of climax. "I'm kicking you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "Get out of the curl!" And his performance never lowers, never falls and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I see it again, and I never get tired of Cristy's sharp eyes, jerking and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> A must-see. FY sho, yo!
