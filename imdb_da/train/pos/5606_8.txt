This is a very difficult movie and it is almost impossible to get a handle on what happens. Initially, it seems to be a pretty pedestrian movie about a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment, and rather invites him to one when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then the twists begin. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why do the dead tenants' clothes come up in the apartment? Finally, one wonders if Trelkovksy is the former tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks Polanski draws on us is lying to us. We assume when we see things from a sign that we see things like character do and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume when the camera shows us things from its all-knowing point of view that we see reality - but Polanski has the camera lying to us.
