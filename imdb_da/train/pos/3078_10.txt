Loved this show ... smart acting, smart dialogue, great story with real people .... so take it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​six reasons ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Ride yourself off the stupid reality shows and give this show another chance. Take it back. Not to grovel .. but thank you! As the air went out I saw the web and liked how I could see it with minimal interruptions, online ABC makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them prime time ... away are the days of endless taping . Whenever you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
