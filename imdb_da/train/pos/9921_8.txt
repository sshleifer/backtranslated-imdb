I have been admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years, and it was a pleasure to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The strong beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the quarry in Vermont, the huge assembly plant in China, the besieged old quarters of Shanghai, just waiting to be torn down: these landscapes are captured by the photographer and filmmaker as well. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought of old TV documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic factory factories; The kind of thing I grew up to see. Burtynsky's work is of great value to point out how industrial activity has only shifted to Asia, it has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the computer scrap yard somewhere in China - the waste had a threatening air about it while the workers were very jovial.
