... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, although the Novak version has a more coherent story line. <br /> <br /> However, davis' Mildred's red feelings seem to me more inclined to an erratic girl who easily becomes a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And these are the raw feelings that make up * the part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has feelings of despair, of failure, of "different" - strong emotions that he suppresses. . Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, shows his feelings immediately and without censorship. She has no feelings of despair, or of failure or of "otherness"; rather, she is just surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than Davis', almost throughout the film. Davis' Mildred was ** never ** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he matures her - for her method of keeping body and soul together and constantly exploiting her love for her - she undoubtedly releases the most passionate rejection of snobbishes than you ever seen on the screen: " my mouth! I hit my mouth !! "Novak vulnerability was excellent. Davis' realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb matches!
