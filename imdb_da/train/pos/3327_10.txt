I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! How can I only see this amazing movie 3 years after it is released? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmly warmed my heart. Big Time. It's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I still have to try: <br /> <br /> Casting is excellent all the time - from main to supporting roles, the play is great, the dialogues are great and the movies are perfectly aligned and edited. <br /> <br /> I think the Farrelly brothers movie is often undervalued - they are not light comedies - they are the ones! They talk about what life is all about (I don't want to tell you!). In my case, this movie confirmed me what relationships are about: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: free them, let them be - try to share passion and pain and always be true to each other. <br /> <br /> I'm not a sports hater but definitely a sport that's ignorant. But in this movie the vibes get you. I could smell the atmosphere in Baseball. Finally, this movie explained to me what might be a sports fan for you and which cool fan families should be out there. <br /> <br /> Thank you so much, Pete & Bob! <br /> PS: If you haven't seen it - please check KINGPIN!
