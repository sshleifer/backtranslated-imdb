Let me first say that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay. Next, I feel that Regal should have got his European title back, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long, already Brock had won it. I'm happy with Storm and Christian, who are labeled champs, best match was Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.
