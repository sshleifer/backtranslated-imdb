I found this to be a charming fit, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of a few big flaws, the casting is wonderful. I have to echo some of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips is terribly disappointed as a teenager. At 27 she is just too old (and yes, it shows) and lacks the song chops for Broadway style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent enough singer and for a non-dancer she is adequate. But she is not Latina, and her character is determined. She is also very stubborn all the way through, which becomes tedious. The girls in Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie fan club really sparkle - with special kudos to Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I've also had Tyne Daly's performance, though I'm not generally a fan of her work. Finally, the dancing Shriners are a rebellion, especially the dorky trees in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is suitable for the whole family and I highly recommend it.
