Yes it was a small budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad thing about it was that you could tell the budget on this movie would not compare to "Waterworld" and although the plot was good, the movie never really tapped into the full potential! Strong performances from everyone and the excitement make it worth seeing on a rainy evening.
