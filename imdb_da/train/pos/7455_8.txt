Goldeneye will always go down as one of your most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about that. But this game, although quite different, could probably be the modern Bond master of his time. This was not a bond game based on material from another medium. This was a brand new one; scripted games. Which even had its own theme song! (wouldn't be tie without it, haha!) Gameplay was great and if you're a fan of bond games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional game creations. Which gives it a more cinematic feeling. With a very "bond" durable story, you feel like you're in the game as much as you are lost in a movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoyable in every aspect, from start to finish. The game is still much more to do.With the rankings system and the unreadabilities to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game, despite being quite old now, in video games year. good game that you can download and play when you feel the need to get a little bit more Bond in your life. Even now just think about it, I have the theme song stuck in my head. Such a great cast and well-written story. > <br /> The story comes alive on the screen, almost as if the actors were theirs in front of you, and is as entertaining as the game itself.Excellent done in true peasant fashion. br /> I'm going to throw this game on now. If you haven't played it yet, you'll miss out!
