I recently saw it on a cable channel. The movie is great; It is one of the few musicals I have seen that does not shy away from light and darkness. It portrays some of the beauty of the age along with a lot of screaming. Some of the set dance dances so much are going on, I didn't know where to look next. One day I have to go and see this on the big screen just to see what happens. But what really lifts this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is a thorough and threatening man, but there is something else, some inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was able to do something. It was almost as if Syke's character was on the edge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I've seen Robert Newton's Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was 'just' a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance scared me into my own living room.
