Seated, Typing ?? Nothing is the last "what if?" party offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One has problems with the connection, has a can from his job (due to relationship problems) and the police are out to get him (because of his job and his relationship problems). The other guy is an agoraphob who refuses to go outside his home, is greeted by a spooky girl guide who urges the mother to claim she was melted when he does not buy cookies from him. Oh yes, the police are after him too, after the man in the girl scout calls them in to arrest him. <br /> <br /> What a day. What if you could do all of this? It is the whole premise behind 'Nothing'. The two fools realize, the police, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything ?? disappear. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also saw at the time of this, 30 minutes had gone into the movie and I still had an hour left in the movie. Could the two actors do this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try out, they are 60 minutes long, and there are obvious dead air in places in this movie. But the two actors, who are lifelong friends with each other and the director, have such a large repertoire with each other that it was fun to look after the dialogue and improve the goofing around the two. There are many supernatural elements, but it is more of their response to those elements that ultimately make this movie worth seeing.
