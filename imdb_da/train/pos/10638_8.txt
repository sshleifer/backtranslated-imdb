When I think of this movie, all the adjectives relate to somehow the physical understanding of the world. Texture, smell, color, I think this film should be judged against. See the rich golden tones around the young concubine who sleeps by the fireplace or the swirling Turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with the appearance of spice, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin rolls. Don't just look and listen, be absorbed, let the story of the story immerse you.
