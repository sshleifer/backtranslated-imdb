Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as bad as anyone on earth. Living in the 1920s Ireland, Gypo and his Irish Irish members are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive British. A special rebellion, the desire to be killed by the Englishman, comes back into the city in secret. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the reward of Â£ 20 turns out to be tempting. Gypo gets his friend killed and sinks in a pit of despair and intoxication. Meanwhile, the other Irish seekers seek after the informant. Along with Gypo with money burning a hole in his pocket, their main suspicion is, but those who are his friends will not believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional problems. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotionally involved movies. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his dull character, and there is much sympathy for him. The script is also very exciting. It is the kind of excitement where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end, so we have to grin our teeth and follow it. The action is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who appeared in many of Ford's films, probably gave his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). Everybody else in the movie deserves his or her kudos. In addition to a fantastic script and play, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionist films. I love Ford's darker side. In her mood and in her themes, The Inform reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); It is also somewhat similar to Wrath's Grapes (1940) in these respects. 10/10.
