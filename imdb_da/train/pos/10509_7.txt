I have not read the novel, although I understand that this is something different from that; the fact that I rather enjoyed it with the fact that this is not really my genre leads me to the decision not to pursue the reading of the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really cannot compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue in this is clever, witty and well-preserved, as well as the greatest comedy source in this. This made me laugh loudly with perfect British and verbal material. Every upcoming performance is spot-on, and Paltrow nails completely the role of a friendly matchmaker. The characters are well-written, trustworthy and consistent. However, I found a couple of them extremely annoying, and while I think at least some of it was supposed to be fun, it tended to be over-repeated, and honestly it wasn't entertaining the first time they performed. The editing and cinematography is amazing and everything looks completely. Plot and pacing are good, you never get bored. It ends in a * real * obvious way, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefers. I can't argue that this didn't entertain me, it did from start to finish and I would see it again. There is concise language in this. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 10.7
