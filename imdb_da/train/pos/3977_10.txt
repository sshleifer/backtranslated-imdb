I personally saw this to see footage from the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to learn how the fabric movement essentially started and became pop culture and any uncompromising force in life. The interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous. You want to be in a secret and nod your head at the same time ... because it feels so good and familiar. I loved it, all segments from the 60's today. I highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, hippie movement, politics and good history. I check the box that says this contains a spoiler, only because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this greeting when I discussed what's in all 4 segments, so just wanted to be safe.
