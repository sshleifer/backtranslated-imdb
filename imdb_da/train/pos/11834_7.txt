I love horses and admire hand-drawn animation, so I expected nothing less than amazement from Dreamworks new animated image Spirit: Cimarron stallion. I think you could say I was a little disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and initially what seems like a perfect story. A story of absolutely nothing, but a horse in nature. The animals do not sing sweet songs or even talk - a big plus. Unfortunately, the film has an unannounced story by Matt Damon; a juicy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the film producers would just have been simplistic, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a good movie, but it is good entertainment for young children. I would recommend this movie to families because it has its heart in the right place and that is the only out there right now, it is not offensive to young children. Not bad, but could have been much better. Very beautiful visual though.
