Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this mammoth black show throwing everything but the kitchen sink. (However, the bath is present.) This movie gives the screen time to any person who was under contract with Warners at that time. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most of them faded from the popularity of talkies. There are also some really notable artists from the Vaudeville era. You'll be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, who does two numbers. There is also the French star, Irene Bordoni, who croons a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the greatest highlights is the two-striped Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which has been restored to this version. It's really beautiful and it's stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" final that runs for almost a quarter hour. This really is an epic of early talkie era. Any old movie will love this.
