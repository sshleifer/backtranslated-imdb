The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a Cuban citizen for the past five years, disappears from the Earth's surface leaving a glaring Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead when he has truly gone to move Cuba to Bolivia to live an assumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara commits to breaking down the corrupt bourgeois government there. Once again Steven Soderberg picks up where 'Che: Part One' leaves (only better this time). The pacification is more on target, the job of acting is ever so fine (including a trip of a malignant appearance Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say, it is probably best if you see both movies, to get the true story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I had the rare open window with the opportunity to watch both movies on a screening - --- talk about a long move!). As with 'Che-Part 1: The Argentine', this movie has no MPAA rating, but contains enough sweet language and violence to easily snag it 'R'.
