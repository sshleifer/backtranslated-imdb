Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on TV, and I think he's great. But I didn't know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" velous as the despised other woman. Good music, intrigue and a death scene involving Amanda's revenge on an abuser Dr. who will stay with you for weeks. I'll leave it by that. Kudos.
