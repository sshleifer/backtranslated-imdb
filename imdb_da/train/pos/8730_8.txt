Many of the American people would say ... What ??? to my opening comment. Yes I know my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to Master Akira Kurosawa's fans, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. We have the farmer who goes to town, seeking help against a grasshopper who wants to steal the harvest from the village. The big difference is the way the story takes. Our samurais, a band of circus artists who are in the original is a very complex mix of personalities, but at the end is what the village needs, HEROES. Please look again at this amazing movie (The Seven Samurai, of course) and find another movie that has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. One tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his Bestseller, but he did not find the third foot of the cat.
