If you enjoy the subtle (yes, I said subtle) actions and reactions from John Candy, you can't help but say this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The observed (and uninformed) guards always saw Candy as a wide actor - a great buffoon. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when he got the opportunity, he could really be razor-sharp and quite subtle. It's too bad that he was thrown into so many roles that only showed his wide side because we never get to see more of the other. Oh yes the movie. You can see "Going Berserk" over and over again (I know) with the frequency of "Caddyshack." It's just as good. The reason is, even though it is a bit complicated, actually quite deep for a farce of this kind. It allows Candy and the always under-rated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to jump off Candy ... and they jump HARD. Definitely worth a look for anyone who has had SCTV or Candy's other work.
