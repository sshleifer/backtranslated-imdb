A comedy of epic fun proportions from the guys who brought you South Park and most of the Orgazmo kills. This vulgar obscene film has completely disgusting, egg-toxic and satirical content. It depicts incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals. I LOVE IT!!!!! These are some fun things. Really fun. Two losing friends create a game in their driveway that explodes into a national sensation. Corruption and greed and challenge make the sport sour, and its up to Coop take it fix. And along the way you will laugh. A lot. That's all there is. Enjoy!!!!
