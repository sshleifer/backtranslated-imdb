It's not well shot, well-written or well-acted, but it has to be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get some kind of closure. They have even slowed the pace of the show, revealing only small amounts of information per episode, but it feels like they have just told you everything you wanted to know. But some of the actors are just awful, and some of the duologists are quite brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out over actors playing Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode is causing. Annoying site plots have become part of the story, which sometimes tells you nothing. The second season, however, has evolved to a point where backlogs reveal more about the island than they previously had. All in all, it's a good show, but not perfect.
