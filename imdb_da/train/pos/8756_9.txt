I accidentally caught this movie on the cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it all and I'm glad I did. I was immediately drawn by the story and worried about the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, take a high school trip and are taken in by a cow man named Nick who causes them serious problems. They are used as sacrificial bulls in a heroin smuggling ring. Taken in custody, the girls learn to cope with their imprisonment while trying to find their way out of their problems. All they are trying to help themselves is short when the Thai criminal justice system shows deficiencies and the girls end up in trouble and lose their US lawyer's "Yankee Hank" confidence. Hank stops trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). Hanken's Thai wife, however, smells a rat in the case and does some additional footwork and investigates that the girls really became the victim. The end of the movie, when Alice does an unselfish action to save Darlene (Beckinsale), had me in tears. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
