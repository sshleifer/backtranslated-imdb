Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dr√∏mmeholdet. This is one of the best thrillers in 2005. A great plot. A good twist. A good eye like that. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest films except "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". This could be the best. The reason is one of the best things about the movie, and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) a giant hotel manager, manages a late Red Eye back to LA. Little did she know that she was followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a few drinks and end up sitting on the plane. Later, he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secretary of Homeland Security who lives in Lisa's hotel. And what does this have to do with Lisa. Well, she should move her room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn't do Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The twist and bring the story really gives it the extra zing and side signs and side jokes really adds to it. Overall, definitely one of the best thrillers in 2005. Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 4 stars
