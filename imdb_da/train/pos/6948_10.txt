The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed thing that happens is amazing, and it's so surprising, exciting, and even interesting, it's almost like reading a book; When you start it, it is very difficult to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh spoke privately to Jack about the possibility of having a mole in CTU, I was 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes !!! (Sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the kind of guy who when interested, he just can't stop) This series is one of the best of that kind. And it is based on a way of having a few different stories that are connected together. Recommended in every way!
