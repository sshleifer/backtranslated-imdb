Although I agree that it is a good but not good movie, for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned, I still enjoy it. One of the reasons is the music: I want to pay attention to the Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - very nice looks on a well-tuned scene in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpets on their day, and they manage to convincingly boggle Jimmy Stewart's mind by playing a hysterical trumpet song, a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. The Candolis really also plays so well, though I suppose the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two. I don't know much about George Duning, who gets the credit for the music (except he apparently worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion), but the casting of the Candoli brothers as jazz-play warlocks was a great touch.
