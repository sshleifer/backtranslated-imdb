Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to enter a World Cup qualifier between Iran and Bahrain. When they are caught, they are written in an area where the fight remains within ear-burn, but out of sight. The prisoners are asking to be deleted, but rules are rules. <br /> <br /> Due to the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it became disarmed to discover that Offside is a comedy and a frequent fun. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of the Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience wondering which one is "right". In 2000, The Circle has made several Iranian women out of the system; their violations are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> But now think about offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything but a comedy, because the situation it presents is, of course, ridiculous. As women demand to know why they cannot watch the football match and their hunters struggle to respond, the only possible outcome is comedy. <br /> <br /> What makes offside the most impact is that young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply football fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the struggle and the historic victory that lies within the grip of their country.
