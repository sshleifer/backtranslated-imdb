I rented the movie (I don't think it was a theatrical release here) out expecting it worse. The previews made the movie look awful. In fact, I was very surprised it was worth seeing; It was loosely written, almost like an ensemble piece of film. It had some very fun moments in it, and though flaws are an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too shaky. It is erroneous, mainly by the horrible soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects, but on the whole it stands across so honestly and generally true to the shape of the show on an altmanesque or Larry Sanders way. <br /> <br /> At the moment it is fashionable to be critical of Jerry Springer, he is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be proclaimed "the worst movie ever made". I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A flawless but innovative and interesting piece of film.
