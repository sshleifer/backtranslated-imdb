I loved this movie because it seemed so perfect what I imagined that life in French colonial Africa should have been like the 50s ("my" generation anyway). But I was really surprised by its quiet pacing and by the brilliant end. Within the last 5 minutes of this movie, focus on what happens. Never have I been more impressed with the "movie" of a movie. I remember shouting "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell on the couch !!
