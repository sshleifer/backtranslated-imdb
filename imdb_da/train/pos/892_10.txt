sammo must have 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great story, great fighting, great characters and great comos. <br /> <br /> This movie looks dick wei at billy chow and chong barrel. sammo goes into play in a casino, sammo loses the fight, but which battle is full of high-speed action and elements of comedy thrown in. <br /> <br /> Some great and touching moments in the movie, lamb ching ying popping up in a cameo and being killed outside - cleaned. <br /> <br /> The end sequence will make you reach the back button as it is one of the best endfights I've seen. sammo takes on lots of guys and ends up squatting up to billy chow.
