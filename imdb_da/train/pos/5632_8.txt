Riveting drama, written by William Mastrosimone based on his stage play where Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacks in his car by arbitrator Joe (James Russo). She manages to get away, but the police inform her that there is nothing they can do. However, she realizes that Joe got her wallet and knows where she lives. When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are out at work, Joe pays his visit to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and breaks her in a number of ways, she gets a chance to hit him back and imprison him. Knowing well, she is in another "his word against your" situation and that no rape took place technically, she does not intend to take it easy on him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions were. <br /> <br /> The movie ultimately represents a showdown between its two opponents. As it continues, Marjorie shows such recklessness that one must wonder if she has not become as creepy as her nemesis. Fawcett does a fair enough job, while Russo is really excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on the screen too much time, the movie has an intimate character that suggests it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young does not shy away from the inferior and more exploitative elements of the situation; the movie becomes unpleasant to see at times. And when Marjorie has the upper hand, things change enough so that she no longer becomes so easy to encourage her to go to blood, and one hopes that Pat can make her see reason. "Extremities," I felt, was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a relatively high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both fine in support (Scarwid has a good moment when Terry reveals being a rape victim) and the pace is consistent. Granted, the dialogue isn't always very sharp, but the material is convincing every step of the way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
