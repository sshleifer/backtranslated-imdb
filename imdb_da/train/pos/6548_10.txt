This is a great movie! I have played all the Nancy Drew games and have read the books and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock) so you can just get used to Nancy, then you can watch the movie because they really don't introduce the characters' names quickly;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting. This is an ultimate return from the former Nancy Drew movies that the Nancy Drew actor did not seem to match. This movie is much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you should see this!
