The absolute sum of this narrow Danes Douglas Circle's birth (born Detlef Sierck) written in the wind forces our attentive attention into every beautiful frame. From its just famous opening series, where the leaves blow into the baroque foyer of a Texas mansion and the wind riffles the pages of the calendar into a flashback, in its 99 minutes, the film compresses all the familiar intrigue to be burned such later, small-screen knockoffs as Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest over their years of running. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme the Americans, in our dollar-based society, find irresistible. Brother and Sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled, troubled heirs of Hadly Oil fortune; boyhood chum Rock Hudson and the new brother Lauren Bacall are the sane outsiders trying to keep the lid on the roiling boiler. (It has been rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann's marriage in Reynold's tobacco money.) As always, the misfits get all the scenery to chew - and the best lines to spit out (Malone, in his Oscar nabbing performance as bubbling nymphomaniac with a jones for Hudson, detonate an entire fireworks display from them). Hudson, when it is good, can't compete with all this over-the-top emotion; Bacall starts strongly but grows recessive, a pure plot of convenience. Does not matter; With a series of set pieces shot in extravagant shades, Sirk gives an object lesson on how to turn out to be overwhelmed with melodrama in the lush consumer paradise of the late 50s America. No one has done better.
