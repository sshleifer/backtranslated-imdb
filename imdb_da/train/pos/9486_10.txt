Finally, a thriller that omits the car crash, explosions and other eye-catching effects. The film combines a simple plot (assimilation of a French president) with an excellent background. It takes a look at men's behavior with the authorities and explains why we would obey almost any order (even murder) that would be given to us. <br /> <br /> It also shows us how secret services can manipulate the course of history and how difficult they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "Hollywood end" that can be easily predicted.
