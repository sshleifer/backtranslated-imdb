I loved the way soil is made. Its photography is incredible, editing it must have been an interesting challenge, and Patrick Stewart's voice over is perfect. In addition, music and audio editing make watching EARTH a deep experience that you will not miss. You are really on a journey to where you probably never end up with yourself. <br /> <br /> Even though I was surprised at the audience's laughter as we watch animals in their daily struggle for survival, I couldn't help laughing at times. Nature simply seems too impressive to understand. <br /> <br /> But instead of laughing, I left the cinema with a profound question: "Howcome 200 years of industry revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?" With this question in mind Do you understand how I felt bitter and powerless after seeing EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have undergone over the past centuries and to stop global warming at once (all that does not is an NGO activist at all!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the site mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I could do to save our amazing world (and polar bear) from its depressing fate. . (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed to find any direct answers to my questions there. Still, it was very interesting to find out more about the movie and the fight that its crew went through. <br /> <br /> I hope it will make my energy consumption. I do not know how to shorten the distance of polar bears, to swim to reach the land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state. <br /> <br /> An inspiring movie is it, but I did not leave the cinema's feeling very happy.
