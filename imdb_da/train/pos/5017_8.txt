I was 15 years old when this movie premiere on television. Being raised in Texas, I understood boredom and monotony in teenage life there. This film touched my impressive teenage heart, and I remembered it wildly for the past 12 years. I recently got to see it for 2nd, 3rd & 4th times thanks to the LOVE channel. I'm still crying because the movie comes in and touches my inner confused teenager.
