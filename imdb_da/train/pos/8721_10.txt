Disney (and the wonderful people of PIXAR of course) offers a nice, humorous story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that the bugs 'faces' might be a little more static than in 'Antz', and they only had four legs (in 'Antz' six ...). But the backgrounds were excellent and the animation was breathtaking. But let it be a lesson: It was not the computer that made it a success: It was the man behind the machine who added the nice little phrases that I missed in 'Antz'. Of course, some highlights were "bloopers" at the end (so keep an eye on the end, it's worth it!), Which was very entertaining and original. The line 'Filmed exclusively on the spot' was intended for the more attentive viewer.
