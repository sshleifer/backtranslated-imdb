Just got out of a sneak preview for this movie. It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The end was so fun that the tears rolled into my face, and it had me that I hadn't bought the big coke. There are certainly some lulls, but in general, very entertaining. The movie gives Steve Carell a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movie. Paul Rudd is fun as always. I love being so fun in these broad comedies and continuing to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more work because he saw freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly fun moments. I highly recommend it to those who just want to laugh like a madman. But if you are slightly offended, you cannot see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, you can't see this movie. And no matter what, even if you think you're one of the "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens watch this movie, just don't see it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.
