This man is nothing short of amazing. You really feel like you've been living his life with him during these tragic events and crying with his family in the end. He was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but to ensure that others who want to survive him do not have to go through this miserable pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "down" day, and I always make me see the big and brighter side of life, just as Jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not knowing about Jonny before when I visited England twice during her life and could have said I had met him. It is comforting to know that Jonny sits on his cloud, painless! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
