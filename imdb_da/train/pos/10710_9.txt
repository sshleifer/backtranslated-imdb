I must really disagree with the four-yardley-rees, who (if he had watched the whole movie) would have seen some amazing Scottish scenes (some of the best ever shot in Skye) and found a movie with a difficult start together in one really exciting hell. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. Rather, it's a movie that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can't say how much "standard" movies live me - pushing the same polished stuff over and over again. Seemed not to be about it at all. It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish movie. <br /> <br /> So the play is not a blockbuster in style. This is because the actors are apparently real people. In fact, I thought the lead role of the boy and his grandfather was really convincing - and sometimes exceptionally beautiful. Seachd really has a different view, as there are many threads that become clearer the second time - that really feeds to the end. Overall, the combination of music and (sometimes) amazing visuals plus a community approach to the actic and non-normal structure made Seachd a very distinctive and memorable movie. More of these thanks!
