For anyone who wants to get an idea of ​​the Soviet perception of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of ancient photographs, which improve in black and white in the mid-century and in full color, as history approaches modern times (ie, the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village characterized by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist in the Czarist era. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings Soviet communism to his village. His son, by the local beauty, fights the Germans during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil industry is leaving and we are being treated to a Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow but completely logical and very well made. It can be seen in three parts.
