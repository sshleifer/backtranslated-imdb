This is a great movie. I love it more every time I look. Most comedies can be rather paralyzed because you know all the gags, but mystery men have so much integrity in the writing and characterization that looks again - as Ben Stiller tears on the hood in the lime or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashing his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbling while he sees the news report, or Janeane Garofalo denies a kiss from Paul Reubens - is a pleasure. This is pitch perfect ensemble acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all setups are paid out at the end. Seriously, if you have seen it and it has been a while, see it again and if you haven't got started. You can't see it again until you've seen it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, tryouts scene. Too many good things!)
