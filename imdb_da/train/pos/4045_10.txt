I'm so glad I got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. I saw it at an independent film festival, so don't expect to come to your city anytime soon. During the film I noticed that 10 people came up and went out. Too bad for them (here in the south, people don't like having to read subtitles). The movie starts slowly but is so rich in dialogue that I never bored. When the action finally comes, I found myself glued to the screen as if I was driving on a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got a big kick in the chapter titles that appear in front of the chapters, especially those that introduce the characters as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when faced with level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of the "video game / comic book" movie, I look forward to it.
