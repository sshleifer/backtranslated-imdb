Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" hits all the brands. The actress is magnificent, the 70mm cinematography is beautiful, the Oscar nominated costumes and sets are amazing, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar nominee) is sensitive and moving. Oh yeah - the manuscript, of a guy named Will S. is not too bad either. Film critics rib Branagh to receive the film's fourth Oscar node to "customize" the manuscript, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy. I can't think of many better ways to get four hours to fly by. Almost every decision Branagh makes work brilliant: the use of England's Blenheim palace for exterior, the edward dress and the construction of "Being or not being" in a mirror hall, to name a few. Casting of Hollywood fixtures like Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in smaller parts can be distracting, but it's nitpicking. The main role stands out: Derek Jacobi captures Claudius' conflict Kate Winslet depicts Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her depiction of Gertrude; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell raises Horatio's potentially incredible role to the pharmacy of true friendship. Each speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; There is not a wasted moment in the whole movie. The final scenes magnify the scale of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branagh's "Hamlet" is a bold, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match Shakespeare's grandeur and poetry with Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent images. It is undoubtedly the greatest Shakespeare's adaptation ever filmed ?? strong praise, but well deserved.
