Very entertaining, very imaginative and cinematic adventures all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside of a fantasy world who enters it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young and beautiful . A kingdom whose king is dying has said that king frees up a competition on his several sons to see who can pick up a ruby ​​first to be king, while a witch's trio will have the star cutting up and Use to keep them young. These three plot threads intertwine in the whole picture mixed with good actors, dazzling special effects, and some solid emotions and humor as well. Stardust is a funny movie and has some fun performances from the kind of Claire Danes as the star (I could look at her for some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could watch her with full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro plays a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as leading Tristan is gracious and trustworthy, and we get some really good work from a group of boys who play the sons out to be king who constantly and consistently tries to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett play their roles well in both life and death (also loved this whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer girl and looks at the funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the whole movie in his short five minutes. But the real power of the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the manuscript is created by his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world, and it works.
