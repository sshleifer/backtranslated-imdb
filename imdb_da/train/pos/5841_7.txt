The history of peacekeepers and townspeople struggling for land, water, law and order, and the respect and ultimate underground of the long anchored herd interests and their hired weapons were worked better in earlier (Shane) and probably later films as well. There are some good action scenes, and the overall layout of history, excluding a disappointing ending, is well done. Law and order and religion have established roots in the city, but the old order of cattle drives, cowboys and gunslingers is still around as well. The two clashes occur in a nicely staged ambush where the towns run straight into a trap. Granger, an ex-gunfighter, plays the guy who is scolded by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun.
