I first caught the movie on his first round of HBO in (probably) 1981 and was 15 years old I thought the movie was fun. I remember not seeing the Alfred E. Neuman portraits shown in theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine set the film and sat abruptly halfway with excuses from the "usual gang" to lower himself to satire such a piece of shit, I just assumed they were joking about themselves, which I am sure they were, but seriously finding them (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was totally surprised. There are probably many worse movies to be associated with. When you watch the movie on video now (for 32 years) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it. And it's a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (IT'S IN THE AJAEN)
