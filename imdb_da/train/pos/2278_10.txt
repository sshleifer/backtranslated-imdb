Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and comes to see this, I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead, I got a movie that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence and above all the enchanting grief in Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is definitely Nolte's best preformation to date. He captures the defeat and self-assertion of Howard Cambell Jr. consistent from the subtle intonations of his speech to the detained tears behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutely fun as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee leads his release from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is undervalued and more than effective as Cambell's "Blue Fairy Godmother". This pinnocioesque story of Cambell, trying to be its own ideal hero and ignorant of his ideal tragic villian, is a mature and lively look at what we are like humans. And apart from that, it's one of the most deeply romantic movies I've ever encountered. Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And at the film's sastivating painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy, as his blueberry modem gives him his wish. And he understands it ... Well, watch the movie and you want to see. Mother Night is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made in my mind. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep into our feelings and is absolutely true to its original author.
