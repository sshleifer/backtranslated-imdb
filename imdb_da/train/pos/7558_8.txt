This episode from the first season fluctuates slightly against controversy with the entire gender bend angle. I imagine there would have been significant editing before this was finished to appease censors. The story itself is original and well written and the management is supplemented by the fine. (Nicholas Lea makes her X-Files debut, but not as Agent Krycek, but as a victim called Michael). I especially enjoyed it built up and ending. <br /> It is different than comfortable. Ignore any bad reviews you may hear. See it yourself and then rate it
