Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 and draws an X rating. With today's standards it would be difficult to hit an R-rating. Jon Voight, who has been better off, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out of town who wants to make it big with the ladies of New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually create a tape that both touches and pathetically. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more than in this depiction. He is so obvious that everything else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award for John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a good hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. Worth seeing for Hoffman's achievements alone.
