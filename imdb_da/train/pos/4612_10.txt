Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this fun, funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster, who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is fun as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole department dedicated to the Munster family. When Herman and his grandfather's wax figures start to terrorize the city, they owe it to all two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. You will laugh loudly as I did.
