An overblown melodrama typical of his period (mid-1950s) and appropriate matinee food. Rock Hudson, the Hulk is always in love with, plays his usual stereotypical role, but in the Giant, made the same year when his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average, he is just in this movie not good enough to raise the caliber beyond a mushy story of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, who rolls through the film in a drunk stupidity and Dorothy Malone, plays a vampire poor little rich girl all over the top) ends the losers, and Hudson gets Bacall - who is rather wood in this part as Don't have enough character or joke to get her going. To rewrite Oscar Wilde, the good end happily and the bad unhappy, it is the purpose of fiction. However, I was interested in reading that film is based on a true story that justified the plot. Like other films during the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Maybe the movie could be restored: Stack's character would ring more true if he saved homosexual feelings for Mitch by marrying. Todd Hayne's father from heaven is greatly improved on everything the sky allows, also directed by Sirk. Maybe Haynes can recreate Posted on Win and give us a truly memorable movie.
