This movie could be one of the most underrated movies of Bollywood history. This 1994 blockbuster had all the good ideas, music and direction. I remember being in Allahabad when this movie ran and it was somewhere in March at Holi time, the people who played their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers at the highest volume. If anyone who likes to see some like it hot and drools over Marilyn Monroe, he should watch this movie. Empty up to Govinda. How many of you know that this movie was shot in southern India and after Sholay could be one of the few blockbusters to hit the Silver Screen.With films like this Indian comedy could never be dead.
