Having set the sitcom world in 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan's next creation was a forgotten gem for the BBC called 'Hippies'. Although they were created by the couple, the six writings were written by Arthur Matthews alone. <br /> <Br /> Set in London in 1969 - Ray Purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his flatmate, the very casual and cannabis smoking Alex, his "girlfriend" is feminist Jill and the far too bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was great as Ray, but he's great in everything he's in. This sitcom had a sense of 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray was much like Wolfie Smith, who was trying to beat the community, but did not fail. Eventually, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can't wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and has not yet been repeated on terrestrial TV, my memories are not too good for the sitcom, but I remember two episodes really clear, the first being the opener "Protesting Hippies" which I thought was a good start - When Ray advocates a protest against sandpaper and the second episode was 'Hippy Dippy Hippies', which I think was episode 4, again a clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom has a negative reaction from the viewers (I can't believe why). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. Oh yes, I can't wait for the DVD. Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies Series 1 Episode 4.
