This was an excellent movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There was so much to do with so many beautiful pictures, and so much compassion in the things that were not said. I was thoroughly entertained and left with a sense of joyous exhaustion, just as I am when I finish most Tom Robbins stories. Now I have not read this particular book by Robbin, so I do not now how this matched, but I cannot imagine that this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The movie left much to you to define yourself, which is the best part of any Tom Robbin's novel that dreams of the details. <br /> <br /> For all of you who said this was the worst movie ever, I have pity on how little of the muffler light is left in your hearts. Far from the worst ever, this film was brilliant. Long live the crane.
