CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" -type kittens that start on a bizarre trip through the afterlife where something can happen. This mind-tripping Asian map uses no dialogue that replaces word balloons instead. There is no way to describe this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismantling and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and scary offense for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kittens swim through and into and also run. But like almost anything else in this movie, the stupid, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.
