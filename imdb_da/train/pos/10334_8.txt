Never seen this movie recently at TCM and found this story about Poland and a small town that may suffer from the Nazi occupations of local cities like many other European cities, for example: Norway. The First World War was over, and people in this city were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded that the war always creates. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former schoolteacher in the city. He was brought up a German and was not very pleased with the Polish people, nor did they accept him fully. As the Hitler party grew to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return and punish this little Polish city for their treatment against him who was truly in his thoughts. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer," played an excellent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved in Whilhelm Gimm. There are many feedbacks and some very true truths about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and their entire lives. Cattle cars are shown on this image with Jewish people heading to Nazi gas chambers. If you haven't seen this movie and give it a little of your time, then this subject looks like this movie is down to earth for a 1944 movie and a story you don't forget too quickly.
