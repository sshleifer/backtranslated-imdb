I watched the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and shouted. This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really hard to have the protagonist as unlikely as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she is not a warm, loving woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets this across without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She speaks it out along the way and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is ridiculous and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little. <br /> <br /> During the film we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors a son over the other, how her losses have formed her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the ship. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "good" movie, but it is definitely a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason ... Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother-in-law or neighbor ... but part of her is present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts give me some meaning now that I've seen The Stone Angel.
