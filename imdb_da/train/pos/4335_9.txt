Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-written role. I loved the nuanced, balanced exploration of a long-term commitment - how often do we get it in movies, of which the film usually ends when boy and girl meet? This is a film for adults, a complex image through the eyes of all parties - man, wife, son - how each one has adapted and grows in history. On top of that I gave myself approx. 10 great suits and I am one of those people who usually sit untouched when the rest of the audience laughs. This was one of the few really funny movies I've seen. Great original jokes.
