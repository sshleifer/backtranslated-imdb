High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a scary attack on their high school. As they begin the deadly countdown to their final revenge act, they start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicles their mission. There is another similar film like this, called "Elephant." Why am I bringing this up? To compare the two films, of course. I have to say, although I liked "Elephant", it's a much better movie. What is the difference, you ask? Well, firstly, this is done differently, much after the line "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead." This makes the movie the better because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what won me was how the film was willing to show "the other side of the story." You learn to know these two shooters, unlike "Elephant." I actually used one of the sliders and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie makes you feel sympathetic to these people, and that's good because it's not always black and white. To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real people with logic and reasons behind their actions. You understand them. It is not as if they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this movie is emotionally gripping and very joking and much better than "Elephant."
