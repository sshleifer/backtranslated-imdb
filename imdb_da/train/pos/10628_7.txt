Despite the occasionally styled play and the "set-it-all-before" story, it's a pretty convincing movie. <br /> <br /> It's excitement, the scenes with the demon are actually pretty scary, some of the visual effects are amazing and best of all, no ridiculously bad humor to degrade the movie, as for many (wannabe) horror movies in them now. This is not the greatest movie ever made, but it actually draws you and at least makes an attempt at character development <br /> <br /> I was glad I saw it
