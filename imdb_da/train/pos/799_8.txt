he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; Kathryn Morris is sympathetic as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but initially a little too much victim. We are saddened by the situation, but at the same time get angry after seeing his victim for several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where she actually gets help with her self-esteem problems, and Capano actually had her psychologist killed. It's pretty hard to believe, but it was based on a true story. There is a como with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as Capan's mother. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true murder, and you would like to read the Ann Rules book to get the exact details. 8.10.
