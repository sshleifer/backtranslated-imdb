Very intelligent humor Excellent execution I can't believe how people could think it deserves a 1/10! I hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it. If you ever have the opportunity to see it ... don't miss it. There is a role when the main actors are running and singing "Happy birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (an Argentinian song for kids (I think ... it could also be South American, I'm not sure)). These two songs have the same tune ... but people usually don't understand that ... it's just shake! I was trying to write this in both Spanish and English because it is an Argentine movie ... but then I wouldn't allow it :( Hope you enjoy it!
