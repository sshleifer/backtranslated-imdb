Why on earth should you explore the fascinating "Earth" nature documentary? How much time do you have on earth, so I can explain this to you? OK, I do not want to extend my study on "Earth" to infinity, but I have to insist on why this is a "must see". Documentary takes a walk around the migratory paths on three animal families: A female polar bear and her cubs with their father's real life intolerant carry boldly to hunt for food on their isolated path, a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration trip for exchange, and elephant moms with her little (maybe not so small, they are elephants) offspring migrate in Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield did an "out of this earth" job in also capturing the survival of many other animal species beyond the magnetic shoots of our three animal family protagonists. The cinematographically talented team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were animals in the camera that shot the wonderful natural sites and animal-instinctive behaviors; Not to mention, the prey of the slaughtered animals was bad. "Earth" is also a lesson teaches about the global warming effect on the animals; Papa polar bears in doc are the poster animal on that consequence. So colleagues, it's time to take the documentary trip to visit "Earth" today! **** Well
