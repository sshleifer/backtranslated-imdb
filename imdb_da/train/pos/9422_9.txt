When I learned about Sir Alec Guinness's death, this was the first of his many films I was thinking of seeing again. What a wonderful droll commenting on the movie even after all these years. And Guinness helps weave the charm of each frame. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered as life-time favorites.
