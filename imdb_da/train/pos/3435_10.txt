This film is a wonderfully simplified work. Enjoyable from start to finish, it is both sad but uplifting at the same time. The performances from Miranda Otto (oh how she deserves so much more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to see as the two tortured souls will understand each other. The Dead Letter Office workers' support aids are wonderful bit pieces in themselves, like Alice's horny girlfriend, whom I couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for. There is a certain scene I could see again and again (and I have!), It is such a shame that movies like these do not get recognition and therefore bring them to the public eye for more people to enjoy. I cried, I laughed and I sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
