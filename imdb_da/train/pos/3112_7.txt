I saw both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before I saw this in the theater. I had been waiting for this page before they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Smaller spoiler under- <br /> <br /> All in all, it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and superiority both floated gracefully between adrenaline speed and introspective drama. This movie felt rude at times. Plot-building down-times were a little too pulled out. It caused the following action to feel too frenetic. <br /> <br /> Camera: The frenetic brand speech Greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me. I know it's been talking about nausea on the bulletin board, but that doesn't mean it's not relevant. All the martial arts training the actors went through was completely wasted. The ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera destroyed most of the fighting in the movie. It's a cheap, student registry trick to make the movie feel undisturbed. I expect the techniques to be used in some horror flicks made for high school kids, but not in this stylish, adult action series. Too much extreme close up too. Make some framing. Get some interesting shots. Constant close-up feels like lazy directing to me. <br /> <br /> History: The story was very confusing at first. They printed new names and faces on you from the prisoner go. Give me the feeling that you come when you come into a movie late and know you missed some important information. Felt rushed or compressed by time horizon. After you get started, the story is pretty good. It's easy to follow Bourne. However, I was not interested in the entire last scene of Supremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) in the middle of the Ultimatum thing. It basically does the film a half prequel. I thought it was awkward. <br/> <br /> Cast / Characters: Star's movie is the action. There are apparently only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. They were doing a little strange to me. I think they would just give Bourne someone to protect and trust them. Unless I completely missed something, they never tell themselves why they collapsed. The other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet. It felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / the one who won't leave open ends. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These assassins are as uninteresting as Castel (the first trap Bourne struggles in Identity). The game is generally degraded as the series continued. Clive Owen was almost an afterthought. It is a measure of strength for the first cast. Second, they basically act Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not so straightforward. This is about Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be named later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names to think of this kind of series. Except for a few breaks that seemed to last a long time, the play was on. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was successful. Felt like they wanted to get the series over with however. If they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, Scott Glenn completely eliminated, zoomed out and took the camera away from the seizure, it would have been perfect. ENDING SPOILER <br /> ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I can't see why they leave Bourne alive at the end. It was my understanding that this was the conclusion. They clearly pointed to the beginning of the series with its silhouette floating motionless. I thought it was. A full circle type finish. I liked that Nicky responded to the news report. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPECIFICS WARNING - MOVIE QUOTES UNDER - <br /> <br /> Bourne's last line at the end "Look at this. Look at what they are giving you." assassin he killed, I loved it. The final scene was great. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot in Bourne. Why would he do it? Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxed her top secret file? did not make sense.)
