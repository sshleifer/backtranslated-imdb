I consider this movie to be the best about Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliot's performance the final Mike Hammer. The Harry Essex script is excellent and includes many improvements on Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes good use of light and shadow. The camera work by John Alton is top-notch, which is the point of Franz Waxman. The game includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the finest private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have been given more options. I've always loved this movie.
