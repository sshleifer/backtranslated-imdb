This movie is an eye-opener for those who can only glamorous lifestyles in the stars. It tells you how people who want to do well can't. Plus, the bomb blast scene is very real. <br /> <br /> What you are reading and being taught just doesn't happen! <br /> <br /> Raising your BP level by 10% <br /> <br /> All actors played their role very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes may / may have been avoided to include teenagers. <br /> <br /> This movie is fully grown in nature. <br /> <br /> Not a family movie. Casting is great !!!
