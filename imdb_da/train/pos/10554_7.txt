Nothing (3+ over 5 stars) Another weird assumption from the movie "Cube". This time, there are two main characters who find themselves and their homes transported to a mysterious white cavity. There is literally nothing outside their little two-story house. It was exciting to be sure, but I thought the comic tone created for this get-go movie was extremely poor. There must be some humor, surely ... and I have no problem with the humor that was eventually derived from our two hero's situation (their final "showdown" was definitely a hoot) ... but I really believe the movie would have been much better if it had been rooted in reality at the beginning. After watching the movie I watched the "Making of" feature on the DVD, and a short trailer at the end is almost completely devoid of the "sillies" comic aspects ... which makes it look like a completely different (and a little better) movies. The last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together ... looks like the latest movie "Primer." The actors are fine when they do not exaggerate the comedy shtick. They are truly trustworthy in their more "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this movie as an erroneous mid-term experiment ... but it won me in the end. (And look past the credits for the final scene ... just don't ask me to explain it.)
