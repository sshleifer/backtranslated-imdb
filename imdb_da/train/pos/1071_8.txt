absolutely need some work in season 2. Like the virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White with his old superculture. During season 2, the only thing that kept me from seeing was whether Max and Logan would ever get rid of the unpleasant virus that infected Max. Very good drama in season two. But of course, like all TV shows, if something is wrong with it, the TV company removes it from the air. I seriously hoped for a third and last season. Season 2 leaves you hanging unless you read the books by Max Allan Collins, and you will know what is happening. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel should be put back in the air for another season, although it may cost a lot just to get all the original actors back. since Jessica Alba's airline shot after the show. If so, there must be a movie to complete it. like the show Firefly, which of course also canceled FOX.
