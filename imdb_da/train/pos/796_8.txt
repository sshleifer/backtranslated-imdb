Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie's boss Tom Carper, the governor was. That's why Feds got involved, he called Clinton and asked him to get the Feds involved in the case. I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time, so the news was news every day. I also read Ann Rules book and saw the "City Confidential" segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomanic (sp.), An uber controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. As she would not let him do more, he killed her, the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he's still alive.
