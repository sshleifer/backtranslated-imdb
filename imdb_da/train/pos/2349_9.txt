It is a pleasure to see such creativity on television again. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The signs relate well, and the writing is not bad (I think it will get better when they get their legs). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> The girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is lovely like Olive. The two aunts are a joy. I sincerely hope they write them in larger parts as they are magical. It's all the news that's suitable for printing. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
