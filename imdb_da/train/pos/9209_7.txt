STAR RATING: ***** The works **** just miss the mark *** The little bit in between ** Storage behind the * Gruber <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) makes his way in peace the vest when he spots a group of men who abuse a lady. As a gentleman he naturally enters and puts a stop to this and then kills a nasty enforcer's son. This is only the beginning of a wildly fiery battle to the end, from which there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who has never been able to go with me. Perhaps I discovered him late, and after the second movie I saw with him in the last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have one thing for westerns, being movies that are just transporting me to another time and place and giving real escapist entertainment, and with this Dudikoff has chosen one of his better scripts when his movie goes anyway. <br /> <br /> The film hits a few low points in the form of a naughty central villain that looks like an empty Marlon Brando and some generally ropey works from some of the casting, along with the mandatory cheap looking sets. But if for some strange reason you were dependent on watching a Dudikoff movie, it would be one of your best choices. ***
