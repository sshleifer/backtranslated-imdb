I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was dam fun! When I first saw, it played on ETV (Estonian Television) And I started to like it. Too bad that the show is bad for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes up with stupid ideas. He got these glasses, which are brown. I like it . And there is FeZ. Group Pervert. We all know what he does when he is alone ..... He wants to get sick. He even had it with his boss in an episode.Here from India. And there is Michael, the stupid guy in the whole group, probably stupid in town and his policeman! He's so stupid that I remember the following: Hyde says: Did you call the police? - No one Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He's a town playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's former girlfriend, and then she is Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric Who is the son of grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty housewife. His one big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they are planning for marriage. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm what I forget? ah Hyde lives in a basement.
