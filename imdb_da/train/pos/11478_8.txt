Chris and Andre are two average regular teens. Misunderstood by some and downloaded by others. But together they stand and everyone pays. Together they form "The Army of Two". They plan and plan "Zero Day". That day is when they decide to disrupt their high school and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. Told through the tapes they made "Zero Day", it is hardly a fictitious tale of the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of the movies that will touch your head afterwards. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen on the street. Their beliefs were very credible, you liked these guys and it was scary. Shot on video almost from teenager's perspectives "Zero Day" feels very genuine and authentic as if you're just there. These children try to rationalize their actions for the viewer and the actors sell it to you. But be warned it follows the tragedy from the beginning to the end, and the end is shocking and uneasy for some.
