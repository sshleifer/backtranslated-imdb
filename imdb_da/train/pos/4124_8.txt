Lloyd Bridges like Mike Nelson and his boat were all stars in this series. What made it so good to me when I saw it was the real feeling of going underwater. The show shows a youthful energy energy for exploration under water that is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was educational and also shows the viewer things about diving from someone who seemed to be a complete pro, Mike Nelson. There were good shows and the program always seemed to be well-produced. Granted, the drama in the scripts sometimes hits the same notes for more than one episode, but each show holds it with every other show produced in this era, the American television.
