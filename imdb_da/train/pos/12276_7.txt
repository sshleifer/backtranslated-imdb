Can such an ambient production fail its primary goal of properly aligning Allende's novel? Of course yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial, superficial film, where basic elements of the South American mentality are simply presented as side events, resulting in total incoherence. I can't believe there was a whole production team that couldn't understand the book! Of course, there is technical quality in this movie, and I think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. And that was something that was the most important part.
