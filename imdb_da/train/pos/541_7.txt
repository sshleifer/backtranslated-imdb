As a sequel, it's not a bad movie. I really liked it better than the first one.i found it more entertaining. It seemed to be shot documentary style. first this disturbed me as i thought it was just too low budget.but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic. This film has more dry a liners than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. I think sometimes they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and characters.it is almost a parody of itself, which may be point.this movie has at least some excitement which the first did not have in my view.it has some of the same great music from the original, which is great. The action again was pretty decent for the most part, though I said some of it seemed over the top. I also thought the movie lost a lot of speed at the end, and there are a few minutes that seem very slow and just don't seem to flow like the rest of the movie. All in all, I thought it was a beautiful sequel.my rating for "Back to the Lake Cottage" is 7/10 *
