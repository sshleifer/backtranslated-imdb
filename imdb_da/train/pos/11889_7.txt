Well done, but basically boring low-life mododrama, which, according to the accompanying interview with leading Isabelle Huppert, author / director Pialat, infused numerous autobiographical details; Considering the primarily unsympathetic characters involved, it makes him no compliments - and he seems to have been a troubled man when Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for several days during the shot! <br /> <br /> However, the action is uniformly outstanding; Despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as a title character!) Were already in the forefront of modern French stars - a status that, with varying degrees of success, both sticks to this day. /> <br /> I have 3 more of Pialat's movies in my "VHS To Watch" pile, albeit in French without English subtitles; because of this fact, but also the oppressive realism of LOULOU - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I cannot say that I have something quick to check out now ...
