The legend of Zu <br /> I remember well Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier. Over a Christmas, in a rare week, when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong film, Zu Warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it was etched in memory for it now grown up language ... In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest movies I saw as a child, from which I can clearly remember the line of story and action scenes. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic prime. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this recovery of Zu Warriors, there was a sense of fear. Could it be the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or will it follow the road to other remakes and die a death more horrible than the evil and the broken throats you find in the kung fu movies? <br /> <br /> Now the answer is, I can't say. But that was because this is not a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. The legend of Zu tells of the story of King Sky, a lone warrior whose master, Dawn, declares her love for him, but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia. Two hundred years later, insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma, and Insomnia has returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, white eyebrows and reds with the help of King Sky are trying to stop insomnia. <br /> <br /> The reason is not one full of twists but had enough detail in it to keep me interested. But I can see this movie as someone you love or you hate. The film is very much about the special effects, where the majority involve several computer-generated environments, like Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie was one that did not overdo the graphics and it was all tasteful. Nothing appears rushed - unlike hero. The backgrounds were complementary to the play and not at all overwhelming the scenes. The story also involves lots of characters, and the confusion of so many individuals makes the movie exciting. It might have been on the verge of 'too many chefs', but generally each character had its role in history. But some of the roles seem to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion, and somehow I have to question the need for this. Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the movie, but I couldn't say that this movie showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have matured in her acting, but it's still pretty raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me. Despite her very short role, I apologize and admit ogling! <br /> <br /> All in all, I have enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the "original". Considering that both films are made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films are part of a chronicle showing how filmmaking in Hong Kong has changed over two decades. And a beauty is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all, as much as apples are apples and pears are bulbs. In the end, both are very pleasant films in their own right. And I go back to reminding you to see the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to see but not compare.
