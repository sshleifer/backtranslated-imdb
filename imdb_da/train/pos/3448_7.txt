A documentary without loss of words ... ever ... Let's assume that the story is more than a spoof, let's assume it's a comment on Japanese society. And as this movie is as fast paced as an absurd documentary as they come, it is a constant word game as fast as it goes, and as poorly translated as it is - in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the Copenhagen Cinematics - It's still pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But for the patient and ONLY the really patient and open minded, I speak to you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I think this is a movie for you. It's an intelligent movie if you allow it to win you over. <br /> <br /> Pretty pretty and pretty kitsch and quite Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world. All in all, fun for those who want to watch a Japanese movie that spoof Japanese food culture. Thumbs up if you are in the mood for something completely different.
