When I was 17, my high school play Bye Bye Birdie - which is not a big surprise as it is perfect high school material and known to be the most scenic musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a music student and kept strong memories of the production and the songs, as well as a long-standing disagreement for the Dick Van Dyke movie version that had deliberately (observed) the Elvis references and set it up for a swinging 60 's audience. <br /> <br /> So when the 1995 version with Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was happy with what I saw. Alexander turns into an outstanding performance as Albert, a performance in stark contrast to his better-known persona from a particular TV show. The rest of the casting is entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not see his part, apparently a naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> But best of all, the musical number known from the stage show is all preserved in this movie and performed as scenic musical songs should be (allowing for the absence of a stage). <br /> <br /> So if you know the musical (and don't get it) check out this telemovie. It shows the scene justice in a way that probably cannot be improved, which is good enough for me. What's better than making a writer's work faithful and in color and style?
