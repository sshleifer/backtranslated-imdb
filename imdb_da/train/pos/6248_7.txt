Being Austrian myself has been a straight knock in my face. Fortunately, I do not live near the place where this movie takes place, but unfortunately it depicts everything the rest of Austria hates about Welsh people (or people close to that region). And it is very easy to read that this is precisely the director's intention: to let your head sink into your hands and say "Oh my god, how can that be possible!". No, not with me, the (in my opinion) completely exaggerated uncensored swinger-club scene is not necessary, I see porn, but in that context I was a little abhorred than put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story of how misleading people who suffer from lack of education or bad company are trying to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still holds back), a female teacher who discovers her masochism by killing her supergold "lover" on the line, an old couple who has an almost mathematical day cycle (she is the "official replacement" of her former wife), a couple who are just divorced and have the former husband, suffer from his former wife's actions, of course, have a relationship with her masseur and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her Drivers are the most unusual issues and stretch their nerves by just being very annoying. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, you feel almost nothing. You're not even shocked, sad, depressed, or want to do anything ... Maybe that's why I gave it 7 points, it made me react in a way I never reacted before. If it is good or bad is up to you!
