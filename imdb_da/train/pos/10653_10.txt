I know it is fashionable to hate this movie now. I've seen hundreds of ghost films, including his original 1963 Haunting and most of the hammer movies. This movie is not detained and does not hold back, which is probably why so many modern viewers did not seem to like it. Yet, many viewers can accept uncontrolled movies such as Scream, because knife ants are easier to believe in most people than demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had many amazing scenes, and plays and theaters were great. I've seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this movie has made a series of exciting and stylish films and did not attempt the kind of realism of 6th sense. Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this movie may appeal more to John Carpenter fans, but more of a traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more frightening. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
