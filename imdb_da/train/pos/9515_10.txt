One of my favorite films, with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, of course, Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the most important members of the mafia, the murderer to say so and an expert. One of the kids wants to know his father's work (a terrible mistake) so he hides on his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say so. <br /> <br /> Mafia doesn't do It doesn't matter, in Mafia nobody wins when they want you out, they take you out. Of course, you can see someone working on the mafia with a huge house, the best car in the world, no matter what you like, but do the wrong job or do something that your "boss" doesn't want and you're fired, and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he did not need to see, and well his whole family is killed for the "wrong thing" his son did. The movie is really entertaining, you can see how the Sullivans live to be chased by the mafia or some of it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit sad, shows us revenge, the dirty works people do, almost everything you like. Hopefully the guy reading this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work on the mafia, do yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you are killed by your boss and their staff. <br /> This movie receives: 10/10
