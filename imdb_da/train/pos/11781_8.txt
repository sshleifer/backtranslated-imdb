The documentary presents an original theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series graphically depicts several episodes that strongly support the theory, and defends the theory against common criticism. I was deeply confused to find user comments complaining about missing new information in these series. They say that documentary films present information that is taught in the middle school. It actually does. In fact, I enjoyed the original look at the information I have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So if you like to know why things work if you've separated the phone trying to determine how it worked, if you've gone to the farm to see how the farm works and how cows will be milked, you will enjoy this series. A specific recommendation.
