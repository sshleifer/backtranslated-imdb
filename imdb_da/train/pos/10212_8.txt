This whole movie is worth seeing just for the magnificent final moment - it's the best end to any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, fun, simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this movie lovely, even though it is French self-seriously-deeply-meaning thing going on. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians were woven in - and by the way, the music under the final credits is great. I want the CD!
