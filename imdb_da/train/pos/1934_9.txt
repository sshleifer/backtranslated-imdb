I watched The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula Film Festival, and was completely caught up in how much I was drawn in. <br /> <br /> The film centers on the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class of different reasons. A humorous idea in itself acts as a catalyst for major changes in the students' lives. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the movie was how really it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces, characters are treated as well. I enjoyed much of the scenes in the class, and the drama that took place outside was very exciting. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately left a very strong feeling, like going to school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, forming strong bonds and making discoveries about yourself, yet you must depart too early . <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that Paula's character had a very strong and unusual introduction that made you know a little more about her than was eventually revealed. I suppose you're not going to meet with everyone in the class, though ... <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I found the film very well rounded and totally entertaining. See it if you get the opportunity.
