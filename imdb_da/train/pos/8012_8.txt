However, as far as the Muppet line goes, this is not the best or the second best. This was marketed to the kiddies, but has some dark and emotionally disturbing adult moments that parents may not want to expose their children to. One of these shows that Miss Piggy goes "post" in a jealous rage, which essentially lasts all the work. <br /> <br /> However, history is progressive and very entertaining. A scene where Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go crazy in a department store is simply fun! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of life and fun. <br /> <br /> I like it a lot and still enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> It puts a 7.6 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
