I really liked this movie ... it was sweet. I enjoyed it, but if you didn't, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even though she is not right like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. For me, the rich girls did not have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, they seem to have all the clothes blindfolded - in a garage sale and just decided to put it together. All the clothes were sticky, especially when they wore the ear bridge with their regular clothes. I don't want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely wasn't! Just go to the theater and see it !!! You will enjoy it!
