I am a beautiful old guy, old enough to remember the taste of oreos and cola, as they were 50-55 years ago, as every taste for a child was fresh. I want me to somehow put aside some, then there is some magically suspended closet so I could taste the things today. This magic locker could even have adjusted the fabric of the fabric to explain how I physically and otherwise has driven a kind of dynamic expectancy chemistry. Over a century and a half, they would have had to adjust a lot because you see that I would have known that I put them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of self and past, and history and sensation that would almost make the intermediate years an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I didn't have enough sense to do that with original cola. And I couldn't have invented one of the magic psychic creatures? Not so But I did something almost as well. In the 1970s, I really voted in Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure ?? You know, movies smuggled out of Soviet blocks. Movies that are so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterwards. Movies that make you live with Polish women, then decide they would be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and set it aside. I did not see it. I postponed until I thought I'd be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I would test myself, my ability to embrace beauty and confine it without occupying it. There are probably a few Poles who have been working on this to practice Chopin. Working to earn womanness when I see it. Trying to get the inside off the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I gained some assurance that it was time to pull it out. I already knew that I was already past the time when this would work optimally because I had already seen and understood "9. Gate." <br /> <br /> If you don't know, it's about a man who innocently rents a room where the former tenant (whose story is called) jumped out of the window to die later after this man (played by Polanski). What happens is the time that is folded and he becomes this woman. We are fooled into believing that he is just angry. But the way we follow him is not. He just blinks that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven that awakens his reality. History doesn't matter. What is important is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he is in the eye, which only creates edges and resides the body, which consists only of confused meat. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can haunt me in the next 30 years. Its the idea inside and out and without outside edges at all? on all but a red-haired wig. <br /> <br /> I don't know anyone else who could do this, this sketch, still a sketch, this scare that remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the Genius of this, you need to know one of the greatest films ever made; "Rear window." The pleasure of that movie is the post-noir idea that the camera is the world; the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it inside. In the rear window, the idea was that the screen shot (Jimmy Stewart) was anchored and everything else was fiction, woven as we saw. Here is the screen environment dweller filmmaker. We know this. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know it is true that organs change identity, which sometimes changes, that cause is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in an eternal horror, on the edge that he accuses, but never shows us and lets us imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted's evaluation - 4 out of 3: Any cineliterate person should experience this.
