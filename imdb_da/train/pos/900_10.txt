This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends have the same. This movie is truly romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or movies like this to keep South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao did very well in this, and their couple also attracts many people in the movies. This is a must see movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This film is also from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is their best right now ... the setting of the movie was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie has to look ... recommended to everyone !!
