Many years ago I found a "bargain bin" copy of this movie for a buck or two. In so many ways, this is quite appropriate as it was made back in 1933, it was really a cheaply made movie of the poverty row study Majestic. But while the film is quite derivative, it is still worth looking at and giving some surprises. The story is very, very well known, as in some Germanic cities, the people are disturbed because of some recent deaths that seem to be the work of the vampires! The addition to this knowledge is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - even though he plays a much more harmless usirdo. In this case, he is obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths. The film does a good job of giving some "red herring" (ie, false leads), and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out, Frye can't be responsible, WHO and why is exciting and makes it very different from average horror movie. In addition, the production had some money to talk about, but it still had some good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and it also used the Universal Studios set at night (when they finished filming for the day). As a result, the movie looks pretty good, although I also thought that Fay Wray was horrible as usual - it didn't seem to detract from the film. I've seen her in more movies than most on IMDb, and I've come to notice that her characters don't have depth - she always seems to be thrown as "screaming lady" and gives a little new to each movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, for fans of old horror movies, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are not fans of the genre, it's probably beautiful at all.
