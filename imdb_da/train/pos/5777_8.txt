A meteor crashes into Crater Lake, the heat of the impact causes a prehistoric egg to weed. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the plot is just the dustbin. But despite the obvious low budget, it is across as one of the most poignant and entertaining monster-on-the-loose movies. There are also some good moments of humor. In an age-filled so-called "monsters" that are no more than ridiculous men's in rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed in frills and forced to tear each other (cheap exploitation style), it is refreshing to discover that Plesiosaur Gem is an excellent Harryhausen-style stop-motion creature. <br /> <br /> Quite a hard movie to find, but it's worth finding.
