First of all, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when dealing with master writer such as Tolkien. This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien's universe of the psychedelia of 1970s, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution, but it is beautiful and not least, and very evocative in giving a unique "sense of space" to each of the scenes. In addition to the absolute uniqueness of image, it is absolutely excellent voice acting-acting that is far better than performance in the new live action movies. And although cell animation may not be the most "technically proficient" animation, it excel in expressive body and face movements in the play while not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motifs to direct abstraction, but the transition to abstract settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the film's themes. If you are a person who is going to have extensive computer rendering in a movie so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie, but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery and JRR Tolkien then this is movies are a must see.
