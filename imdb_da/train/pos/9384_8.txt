An excellent example of "cowboy noir" as it says, where vacant Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses on a job because he insists on being honest (he has a bumblebee). With really nothing else he can do, he decides that he should once lie. When he enters a bar, and owner Wayne (the late, big JT Walsh) fails him for a hitman Wayne has made to do in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in fine shape), Michael plays with and Waynes' money. * So * he goes to Suzanne and informs her about her husband's intentions and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If it didn't complicate it enough, the real hitman, "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, plays in a perfect role for him), and Michael is in even greater trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" gets a lot out of the sites. Director John Dahl, who wrote with the manuscript with his brother Rick, was wise in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated little town that may have seen better days and where residents could be involved in any kind of arrangements. It is also an entertaining idea of ​​the kind of problems an honest person could enter if they decided to abandon their principles and indulge in any level of temptation. It's a markedly dark and twisted story with a selection of protagonists who, if not corrupt, have at least been morally compromised as Michael. The illumination of cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is amazing in his mood; Even the climax of a cemetery gives a good morbid quality to it all. Although the writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the film has a good way to fascinate the viewer and just draw them straight in. Cage does a good job at the head, but his co-stars have a great old age sinking their teeth into their fleshy and greed motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are all fun to see in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are fine as Walsh's deputies (in a particularly good twist, Walsh is also the local sheriff) and there is an entertaining cameo role for country & western star Dwight Yoakam, who also remakes the movie with an enjoyable final credit tune. <br /> <br /> It is a good little movie worth checking out. It moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else is surely never boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
