In our household, we are huge fans of A Christmas Carol and look virtually every version every Christmas, including the old 1938 Reginald Owen and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our overall favorite is 1951 black and white classic, because Alastair Sim is Ebeneezer Scrooge and his conversion calls the true. However, this 1984 release has its own unique merits and creates a wonderful and entertaining story, quite faithfully in general to Dickens novel. (See my comments on the other movie adaptations, if interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott can certainly seem pretty sharp and doesn't make a bad Scrooge. I love their sideburns, his long topcoat & hat. He cuts the party's finest fashion figure and a pretty beautiful gentleman. But sometimes it seems that Scott enjoys his role as Scrooge just a little too much and doesn't take it as seriously as he should! <br /> <br /> This rendition has the best overall Christmas voice, hope and optimism. Somehow you know that this story will have a good ending. Filmed in the city of Shrewsbury, England, it just seems somehow British. The film has a nice musical score, with wonderful, lively caroling music in all the right parts of the story. Sometimes I could almost smell chestnuts frying and pudding singing in copper! <br /> <br /> Marley's attacked ghost (with his wonderful staggering scene) and the three spirits are all quite convincing. Christmas Past is a lovely ethereal lady, Christmas gift wonderfully giant and jovial, Christmas yet to be shrouded and vain as always. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a little bit quiet and gloomy, almost as jolly and cordial as he should be. I like the nephew's wife, whom they have named Janet, with her lovely, hard-time hairstyle. Instead of the blind man's bluff, they made a game called Similes for the nephew's Christmas dinner party, which is a sweet little touch, Scrooge comes straight into the spirit of things. <br /> <br /> The cratters and their little skinny (though much appreciated) Christmas dinner is well depicted, with bob (david warner) appropriately sympathetic and suffering in his miles of scarf. Mrs. Cratchit is charmingly depicted by Susannah York, who also starred with George C. Scott in the wonderful 1970s adaptation of Jane Eyre. Above all, this version undoubtedly has the best Tiny Tim, not just a sweet and loving little waif but sickly. With the dark circles under the eyes, the weak creature seems unlikely to survive the hour! <br /> <br /> This is a lovely and warm warming of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere, it is safe to put you in the spirit of the year.
