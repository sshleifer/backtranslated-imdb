This is movie production at the simplest and it is best. <br /> <br /> I had my doubts because although Freeman is a great actor, he sometimes gets involved in bad projects; It's not one of those times. It's a little story that goes a little over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we get used to getting movies to stay longer and longer and not necessarily better, the director spends the short time in his favor because the characters are so well-defined from the start (great pictures of freeman and Vega by the way) that the little bit of background information about them seems real, Morgan is himself, although his name is not mentioned, he has been out of movie for a few years now because he was saturated with the company and developed a fear of committing to a script and examining a character in an indie film where he plays a store / supermarket manager. The story begins that he falls into a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where he meets the treasurer of the 10 things or less (Vega) and has to take a trip with his reason why the "production" forgot to pick him up. <br /> In many ways, it's a roadmap, Morgan gives the laughs and quirks with its incredible smile and positive perspective on everything and shows a complete actor who has trained to define all he sees to a character he could play, and Paz (by the way, an extraordinary beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a 25-year-old seperate woman working harder than anyone without getting any credit in a death. talkie, there are many dialogues, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is persistent, the characters become so lovable immediately that you use the last 20 minutes to beg for more time on the screen's odd couple, but the brief is in history, so it was a good call from the director not to give in.
