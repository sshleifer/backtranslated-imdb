I want kids movies still made this way; dark and deep. There was (get this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character), plot development, great animation, emotional involvement and a rational, relational and consistent theme. If not for the handful of song and dance routines, you would never have thought it was a kids movie and that's why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent movie, let alone for a children's movie. It brings me to my second point: This must be the darkest "kids" movie I've seen for some time, it comes from a 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see every child under the age of 8 not quite scared over a lot of the latter half and part of the first half of the movie, and it ends up with one of the most horrific conclusions you could ever come across (ala "Jurassic Bark", for those of you who are Futurama fans), and that's what makes this movie so good. Just because the film universally evokes feelings that we normally do not have to feel and assume are bad, the film does not make itself bad; In fact, this means that it succeeded. Good funny movies make us laugh; good horror movies should scare us; good sad movies must make us sad. My point is that good movies must move you, not just entertain; This movie moved me. Also this film is incredibly violent in today's standards for a children's film and contains subject matter which according to today's standards may not suit some children. Parents, I want to say see it first. I am usually not one to say anything about this kind of thing, but I just saw this yesterday, and it came as a surprise to myself.
