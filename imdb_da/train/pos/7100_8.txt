I watched his movie in Dallas, Texas when it came out in 1986. I remember those who are giving prizes to look up to watch the movie. After watching the movie I can see why. The movie was not bad, nor was it amazing. The problem with this movie was that it was trying to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters, and tried to pack it on the Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is that the action is about another wave of Robotech Masters attacking the Earth. They even used the same scenes from Master Saga, but with different dialogs. As a child I loved the movie. But unfortunately I haven't seen it as an adult and can't give a better review. Looking back I was disappointed, but now I would love to watch the movie and rethink my attitude to it. That being said, would anyone like to release this movie to the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and can't wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
