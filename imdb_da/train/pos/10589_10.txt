I enjoyed the Longstreet, which came in the steps of Raymond Burr's successful Ironside television series and was meant to compete. But this show was canceled after a season because it was decided - I think mistakenly - that Longstreet could not compete with Mr. Burrs Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this show was especially well done and very memorable. I hope a box set of Longstreet will appear. <br /> <br /> Authors should note that this history idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show acting and interactions of disabilities on television.
