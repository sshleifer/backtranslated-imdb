Bill and Ted's fake journey is possibly the most outstanding movie I've ever seen. Although the play and stage etc are poor, who cares. The story is brilliant, and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent, the ideas are also good. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best thing is, of course, when they 'melvin' died, I jumped up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is so much better than the first one, which was also great. Possibly the funniest movie of all time !!!!! However, I think the best parts of the movie are when Bill and Ted shouter are excellent and play the guitar solo, it was fun. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, get a third movie !!
