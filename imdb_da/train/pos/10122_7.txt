I found this a little difficult to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while trying to make head or tail of who fought who and why. One of the problems is the cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem, which we know a little, and because we simply read English subtitles, inevitably lose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there are just too many, only half-explained terms and coincidences. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a very bad Miiki movie, and it certainly is not. Lots of stylish and brittle violence, a window on some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect. All in all, a decent trip but maybe checking out the story can actually be helpful before you see this one.
