In fact, I thought it was a comedy and sat watching it wait to laugh at my ass. Pretty soon it became clear that it is no comedy, or at least not a 'Jim Carrey type'. what we were watching was the characters - the movie starts with some rather grim, troubled people, gathered together to try to fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. We begin to get bit by bit in their lives, witness their problems, guess their thoughts. I have actually made it look much darker than it really is, and besides the chain of events, soon brings some light and hopes for their lives. I probably would not have watched the movie I had known it was not a comedy, but rather a drama, but I was happy, enjoyed the story and did not mind I spent about 90 minutes with it. <br /> <br /> Many movies deal with the alienation of people in the Western world, this film shows how people can get together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and if in the light of dying day you meet her, do not let her pass you and go, do not lose her; she is your gift from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> peace and love
