I went to bed with my gf last night, and as she brushed my teeth, I switched channels until I encountered this Chinese movie called King of Masks. At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie, so I started to watch it, and then it caught me immediately and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor to be so small. Maybe it was in Chinese, so the English was called made it harder for me to tell ... but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl, as she continued to try to please her "boss", but everything just turned out to be rotten. laugh out loud. Even when she brings him to another grandchild, he can pass on his art ... it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... no matter what she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandfather, it just goes back. <br /> <br /> Finally, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks ... which is just as warm after all the accidents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a gem and totally original. <br /> <br /> Scott
