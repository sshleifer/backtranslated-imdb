This movie really surprised me. I was unsure about it first, but the movie was getting better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the searcher audience, but for those who like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover, and man. If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content, it's really not for you. <br /> <br /> The story is somewhat difficult to follow sometimes, but eventually I think it did everything better. The ending was unexpected as you were almost falsified to believe it would end up otherwise. <br /> <br /> As for the play, I think it was good. It won't be up to an Oscar award for too long, but it has at least caught my eye. Gil Bellow's portrait of a prison man is not always perfect, but it is very entertaining. Shaun Parke's portrait of Bellow's prison comrade Clinique is amazing and extremely powerful. On the downside, I think I'll put Esai Morale's portrait of Markie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, whether you love it or don't like it!
