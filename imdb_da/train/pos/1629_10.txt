This movie is so cheap, it's endearing !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn), they provide the most entertaining screenshots in movie history. I own 2 copies of this movie on video ... on one, Ralph Macchio is actually caught in the background of Major Vaugn while he ranting on "Hash". Of course, they forgot to edit this error out of the movie, but it shows how fun the movie is when the actors themselves can't hold a straight face !!!
