An inventive, exciting exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that sets a tough challenge by being completely put in two rooms. Not quite successful, but tight, surprising and well-behaved. You can find the movie somewhat reminiscent of SAW ?? two men caught in room and pitting against each other ?? But unlike the movie, it dares with its premise and keeps the hero locked in its cell throughout the film. It's like seeing a laboratory experiment. Some may find the excitement contained boring, but this reviewer found it exciting. The sound and the film of the film are amazingly well realized. This is a particular good movie to use to display a good home video system. Just right for a sennat movie party when you are in paranoid mood. It kept me awake at night.
