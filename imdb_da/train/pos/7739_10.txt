Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He is hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I've ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers, psychotics and boomers. This movie has Thompson nailed - "If God made some real mistakes in this world, it was to give us a will to live when we have no excuse for it." Each character in the film balances on a barber's edge between surreal and eerie realism. There is blurry, lurking uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and exciting well-meaning Doc Goldman, played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric provides a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance like Kid Collins, a non-enlightened, shy ex-fighter who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale that we can't quite figure out. It's not your standard movie, it's not supposed to be either. Following Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite authors, Jim Thompson.
