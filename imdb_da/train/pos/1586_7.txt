Rosenstrasse is more of an intimate movie than one of epic proportions that could have kept away many movie guests looking for a pianist-like plot. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, chooses a feminist peep for an era too much illustrated in his colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from ordinary Aryan German viewpoint, rather from a Jewish point of view. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they appear to be victims. The pace of the film is introspective, slightly slow, meditative. Moreover, the characters are so vivid, while transitions between the generations and the course of time have been beautifully designed. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative errors are well-understood. Another flaw lies in a trivial filmography that is unable to capture the intensity of the inner drama of the characters. Nevertheless, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German movies dealing with the ghosts of a nightmare past, trend that includes as good films as nowhere in Africa and recently the controversial decline. I would recommend this movie to those who read more than the pictures.
