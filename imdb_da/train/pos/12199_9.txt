The first mystery is to guess what Welles' original movie was like. It makes this a true adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and use film forensics, imagine the beautiful woman it once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you will both see and experience one of the best movie mysteries ever. As mysteries go, the story is quite common: a simple diversion, a jealous man like red herring. What is rather miraculous is Welles' location of the story in an artificial eye that sees a dark, dark, multifaceted world. The first real noir, but even darker. It is not a naturally twisted world unless you think of the camera. What we can see first hand is that someone creates a vocabulary that later becomes commonplace. <br /> <br /> For the whole celebration, Kane was successful because of the great drama and history. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the mystery tale and Shakespeare's own reference to this eye. Othello and MacBeth have both begun this time and I consider them part of a single vision of this. <br /> <br /> Here, Noir feels hinges on the notion that people are not responsible for their lives, even a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So by telling this story, Welles must make the environment a character. More characters as suspects in the mystery. Thus, we have the famous lighting, blocking and angles we know (and have since seen countless times). And we have the deliberately closed sets: the park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and funhouse. I am sure that what was cut by the barbarians was plenty of "external" narrative that was not about character, but with these strange surroundings. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did so, among the other sign environments introduced as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of black Irish (as we know from notes and a scene typing in union hall was an aspiring novelist) was neither: a force of human conspiracy (the park or civilized version, courtroom) or nature (picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of deliberate caprice of the gods for entertainment. This is, of course, a self-name for what Welles does: putting these people (including themselves) through hell to our own caprice, a matter emphasized by the Beijing Opera set with Welles baptism. And of course it leads to the museum, where the environment directly thinks with perception. <br /> <br /> More about the self-reference: There is certainly a conscious comment on his relationship that he will soon be exodus. But I think there is strong subconscious comment on their own to get the environment in which he worked, the study environment. Surely Welles was just as much screwed up and in the same way as his character. And that scrubbing took the form of the murder of this movie and left the rotting body mentioned at the beginning of this comment. The poor Rita comes from China binds the entire Chinese theater, the expected rape from above, the loss of the woman. Investment in the environment beyond everything.
