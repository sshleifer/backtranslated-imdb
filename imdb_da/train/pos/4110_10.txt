This and "Hidden Fortress" is Kurosawa's, which is most dear to me. I don't hand out 10's as sweets, but it certainly deserved it. Although it is quite long (like all Kurosawa is very much), it agrees with the problem that tugs me with most of his films; The story is often too loose and slowly evolving, containing scenes that are unnecessary or just extended too much without any real purpose with the story or character description. The Death Suade gave me the same experience as, for example, "Hidden Fortress" did; Despite its length, there was not a single minute I would cut out. <br /> <br /> This is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie in a way it has no history but many small independent stories based more on the character description than the story, unlike any other Kurosawa movie I have seen so far. It also puts a lot of emphasis on the dialogue, which he spends brilliantly (especially in the story between the father and the son planning their "new house"). <br /> <br /> Still, what makes this a masterpiece is how the subject is as tragic as it is, successfully described as humanly and sympathetically without pointing at anyone at any time. From the beginning to the end, the entire emotional scale delivers from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
