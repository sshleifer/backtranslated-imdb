I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I only saw this accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the finance industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they broadcast this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at times. The view is less than an hour long. I felt that this show should have gone further, but casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care about Sylvia but missed the actress Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt that this show took chances and it worked often. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or attempted to surpass their British counterparts. I also liked that they had tried to internationalize the cast instead of making them all British. I liked to see Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt that this show should have lasted longer. At times, I felt that the previews lasted as long as the show was in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.
