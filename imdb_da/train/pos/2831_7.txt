I stumbled upon this movie as I was ebay at Caesars Palace stuff, as I am enchanted by its rich Vegas history, as the last of the original luxury resorts are still in good condition (unless you count Ballys, the original MGM Grand). In this respect, this film delivers full strength. You get a grand tour of Caesar's property, which, despite all the renovations and additions they have made over the 40 years it has been open, looks alarmingly similar. As an overall movie, the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, thanks to much of the horrible editing. And when I say terrible, I don't use the word easily. There are many spliced-in, second-long excerpts of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene in which the Robert Drivas character has a conversation with his father about how much he is adult, and without any explanation, he (driven) goes (in the infamous excerpts) from being himself to a baby, to a little boy and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father. (It doesn't give away any plot details, if anything one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as I was at editing.) The film has older older people and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son, which most guys could relate to in some form.
