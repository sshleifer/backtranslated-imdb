I disagree with previous comment on this movie. I think it was sweet and fun, and it brought a good message to young girls like my daughter. You don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. You can be smart and beautiful and classic at once. I think the throw was good, and the story was fine for the audience. All in all, my wife, daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I highly recommend it. It also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original Nancy Drew mysteries that I am sure she will love much as I loved Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to make her sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can't think of a better result for that movie than regaining interest in the classic series.
