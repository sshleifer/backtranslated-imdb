As a lover of the surreal (in art and film), I was delighted to discover this movie at the IFC. It is definitely a goalie. Most of the other reviews tell the general plot (not everything correctly), so I won't bother drilling anyone with it. The most important thing is the alternative world concept created by Ana's upcoming illness and how she manages to link with another after being so "alone" and finally with her family, which I think is still at least a little worried. It can only be called a horror movie because it has scary scenes but is a fantasy (with a slight hint of "age" only because Ana is a pre-teen who "hates boys"). I highly recommend it to those who appreciate their imagination.
