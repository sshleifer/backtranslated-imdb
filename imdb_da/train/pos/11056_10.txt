Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up with "The Baron" with this, a fantasy series of three superhuman spies, who pursued 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It was a favorite of mine when I was young and I still enjoy seeing it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable screen chemistry such as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the delightful Alexandra Bastedo moved through his role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderful gruff Tremayne. By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own 'The Interrogation' compares favorably to 'The Fanger'. I'm sorry there was never another series; the concept had so much life left in it. Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron's feelings? What if Tremayne had learned about the powers of Champions? Do the masters have other abilities than those we saw? We have never found out, unfortunately.
