If the redundancy of getting out of the boat, on the boat, from the bus, on the bus .. is a way to waste time, then go back to the Hollywood movies which pack this part into a montage to get to the money shot. And in that case, leave yourself unbounded and in the cinematic limbo that is because you don't really show the reality of life. The long drawn travel sequences actually give the viewer the same frustration and "wait state" as the emotions must endure. Frustrating? Yes. Vital? Yes. The limbo of this journey is the key to this "Turkish family" rootlessness. Beautiful movie with great plays. Sad but worth it.
