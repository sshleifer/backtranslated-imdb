I think I'm reading this place: Joe Johnston (film director and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something raised their brains to a The title of the movie "Rocket Boys" (I guess) lacked anything. <br /> <br /> One day, they were chanted with a PC program that word words in other words (ie: you write a word or a number of words and it blends the letters and forms other words) That the technical term is an "anagram". In any case, they wrote in the "Rocket Boys" and certainly what comes back is "October Sky". They were shocked to say the least. The title summed up everything in the movie when the film is about Sputnik. First, Homer Jr was not happy with the idea, but he stayed up after the "movie poster paperback novel" came out and left.
