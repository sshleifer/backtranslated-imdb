Very good martial arts movie and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee. Li is excellent as a low key librarian / cop who saves time and time again. He has a presence and a look that is nitriding and trustworthy as the kung fu wife you have nothing to do with. Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in the mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage, she has innocence and a joy all at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with the sunglasses and the long hair was also very good, but I can't find his name in the credits, can anyone help me with that? Thanks! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask, in every language its great entertainment!
