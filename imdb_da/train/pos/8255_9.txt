Fido is a sweet comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the ordinary crap that must entertain us these days. As has already been pointed out, it is hardly a real zombie movie, but rather a sweet satire that uses the undead to point fingers. Though there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this film is presented (feel-good 50s style), I can't imagine anyone being actually scared or off by Fido & his fellow mates. <Br /> <br /> While cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. Humor is not in your face, but rather subdued; There is a lot of attention to detail, and I've got myself smiling several times throughout the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece in the cinema, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy.
