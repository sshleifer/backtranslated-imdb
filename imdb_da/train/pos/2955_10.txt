There is a certain allure I have always found in discovering the large (semi) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films - in my opinion, unknown sci-fi, action and horror are unknown for very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on video in a junk shop, mixed among countless dozens of tapes of different quality. Of course it is the only place I would find it as it is still not on DVD. While I watched Judy Davis (like Lillie) during this movie, I was somehow sure I saw a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I had previously seen Davis in several small parts - and a leading role in "A passage to India". But even though she was fantastic in the aforementioned movie, "High Tide" is a completely different animal altogether. Since I recently watched Gillian Armstrong's later film, "Charlotte Gray", I was very attentive to the kind of actress who impresses her. Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensitivity. Judy Davis' performance is amazing, I can't say enough good things about it. She shares a fantastic screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (like Ally), this film's second major actress. There is a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together, the details that I will not assume here (see for yourself!). There is too much good in "High Tide" to cover in a review. In fact, I would hardly like it - the movie speaks well enough for itself. In conclusion, I would like to commend the writer Laura Jones for her amazing dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors and the great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, discreet filmography (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
