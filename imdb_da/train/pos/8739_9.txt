This is a FUNNY movie. It has all the usual Disney components (music, great selection of characters, history, appeal), anchored with great animation and the excellent talents of lesser-known actors like those in "Antz" and "Egypt's Price". <Br /> <br /> The characters seem really good and have a strong appeal, and humor is aimed at a broad level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in a fantastic cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've watched the movie three times and I intend to take more friends to see it over the weekend. Many skeptics have seen this movie on my recommendation and have not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that no one has ever gone out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction. See it and don't be dismissed because it's animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie and make sure you stick to the final credits! Bloopers and out-take at the end is the funniest part of the movie, which is full of laughs throughout.
