This could be the most underrated movie of its genre. I can't remember seeing any advertisements or advertisements for this that could be the reason why it didn't do well at the box office. But Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. I put it within the 10 most preferred horror movies on my list. <br /> <br /> Movies begin with snapshots of images and news articles that tell us about a killer calling himself "the hand of God." And then a man goes into a police station and tells the boss that he knows that the killer is his brother. Two of them go together to go to a place where victims are buried, which can help solve the case. During this trip, the man begins to tell brother's story and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father, who one day claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons who appear to be fasting people. He receives from God a list of names to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him accomplish this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is a very horrible and exciting movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The excitement runs high, innocent people (or demons) are killed, and religious experiences are questioned. It doesn't have one, but get very intelligent phrases at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty to you. I own the DVD and it is one of my most favorite horror thrillers.
