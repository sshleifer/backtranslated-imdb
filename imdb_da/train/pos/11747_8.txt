A great effort for an Australian show. which probably does not look surprising, as there seems to be some resurgence in quality Aussie drama. Dare I compare this show to the joy of love my way? none. But it is reminiscent of our early secret life. Cast is amazing, gibney works her magic in the first two episodes I have seen, the British cast is strong also especially callum and lizzie characters. But it may be saving light (not that it should be saved) if this show is getting another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome highlight mini-series a few years back, but he was fantastic as a halter in always greener. it is also good to see brooke satchwell again. Let's hope the show gets better with each episode.
