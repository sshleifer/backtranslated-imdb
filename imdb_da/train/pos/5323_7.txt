There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not too important as what happened to who and when there is still doubt. The most obvious freedom with the facts I think is when they start playing at Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller when they actually played at Indra and moved to Kaiserkeller later. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the movie was biased in favor of Pete Best's version, but if he is a history consultant, I guess he's calling the shots. I also agree with Semprinni that the footage of Pete Best is playing, says the last word on the subject of why he was fired. Although the film is not so lavishly produced as the later movie "Backbeat" I prefer this movie because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> There are plenty in the movie that are quite significant - such as Brian Epstein is trying to hide the fact that he has been "queer-bashed" to find out only that the band knew he was Gay all the time. Little touches like the band goes into a cafe and orders "Corn-Flakes mit Milch." My favorite scene, which actually has some bassists, is where in an audition Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar, but can't play it, so he stands with his back to impresario and tries to fax it but gets caught. It's rock'n'roll. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
