This is an important movie. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There is a lot to like here. The director seems interested in taking several of the more tired movie conventions. Unlike a lot of recent American cinema, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD contains a lot of bonus features, and there are two comments that explain the movie to the viewers who are still immersed after an initial show. When the film was screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audiences uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated viewer, it is a treasure chest.
