I saw McCoy's reunion and was happy to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now, it was wonderful because I always saw the show growing up, so when the TV said there was going to be a reunion, I was so excited !!!! The only thing I couldn't figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I came to my computer and tried to find out and found this place, so if there is anyone out there who can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I would be grateful !! I have searched everywere and no luck. All I could find out about Michael Winkelman is that he was born in 1946. This show had value and morals, each show gave a lesson to be learned. today it does not have. Whole cast was incredibly the only thing better than finding out they would be meeting them, so then it is impossible if anyone can help do it!
