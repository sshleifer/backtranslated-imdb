... I saw this on cable back in the late 1980s when I was a big wrestling fan since 1986. I saw this on VHS in a 'for sale' bin and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and would always go back to see this to see how it was a very accurate depiction of people involved in wrestling ( families and friends who would not understand us, the journey, heartbreak, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to see since no one else can understand what a genius he is creative. A great way to distinguish himself from the Fonz character he played at Happy Days at the time. Also watch the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get a chance, see it.
