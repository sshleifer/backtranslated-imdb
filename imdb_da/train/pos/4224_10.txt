I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it, and she's wonderful as a successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delicious to see as the perky beloved writer who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames her niece's husband, the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have left her. I would have loved someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I really don't like Hartley in anything personal. And of course with Columbo, there is something laughing when he asks Veronica questions on a belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart sluth herself and she matches wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk.
