Gandhi my father is like seeing a book, chapter by chapter you read it (with your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and for that matter Kasturba Gandhi. So little is known about both of them, and this film describes them unambiguously. The title, however, is misleading, it is just as much a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as if Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya are fully entitled to their respective roles. Such films are like jumping. They come after only so much time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi My Father is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever made. <br /> <br /> See if you like quality cinema.
