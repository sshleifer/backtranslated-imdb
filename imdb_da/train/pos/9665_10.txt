Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we laugh at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes on the tribes of one of her amazing ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see Bette), then it's the second best. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years, but never lost its power. Her more "vocal correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, here it is just more clean and as hearty as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.
