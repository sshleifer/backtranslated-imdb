CitizenX (1995) is the developing country's response to the lamb's silence. Where 'Silence' terrorized our peace of mind, 'Citizen' exhausted and mourned us instead. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates quite well, thanks to a Western friendship between two Rostov police who become the same. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also argue for (!) death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey's life for life David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are Machiavellian mammals under which limbic brains (lizard logic) lie. Why have two children who knew better, stones to death a toddler they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women shout "lililililililii" on acts of OBSCENE terrorism? - My own name for this is `limbic domination ', lizard-logical urge to dominate an' enemy '. If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in your vocabulary, you are easily capable of "limbic domination". In World War II, Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don River near the Black Sea) destroyed no Andrei Chikatilo's urge for "limbic dominance" from overwhelming his civilization. Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) 's simple victims were paupers, usually children who drove the interurban train for fun as they could not afford anything else. CitizenX reminds us that the denial of a violent Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such "lambs". Rostov's serial killer went off for almost 7 years after the police were arrested and let him go. Crime fighting policies are detrimental to police forces everywhere. Although the police routinely suffer from corruption around the world, in the west, politicians' voices can create chronic inter-agency rivalries that reinforce a more coordinated response to crime. However, in the Soviet Union of CitizenX, Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea )'s Killer Department suffers from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosocially inadequate Chikatilo with flawless but undervalued authority - to the point of complete obscurity. In fact, Chikatilo also had a lifetime experience that interfered with and evasive prisoners. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, his persecutor stands out as a strange bird, given to unruly, naive outbreaks. Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics boss Burakov. The Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humorless and sullen, unlike all. So it is Donald Sutherland who goes away with the picture. Sutherland's coal. Fetisov, Burakov's chief, and first his only supporter, is an overly imprisoned, patient militiaman whose worthy carriage bears witness to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His revival as a logic-driven, but still passionate politician becomes the cornerstone of the film's idealism. Joss Ackland makes another trip as a vicious apparatchik, secretary of the Communist ideology Bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation. Of course, he stopped the arrest of the most likely suspect, a communist, in 1984, a rope man and a knife in his bag to go home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> He soon replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), insisting that the study now focuses on "known gay people". The funniest scene in this sad, sad movie comes under Bondarchuk's & Gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: A stupid politician reports seriously: "As I suspected companion, it's bad. I've made some drawings - cue howling laughter. <br /> <br /> Five years after the bodies began to pile up, in 1987, the police finally sought to seek criminal profiles. The only cooperative Soviet psychiatrist was dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who called UNSUB `CitizenX '. He later also observed Fetisov & Burakov that "... together you make a wonderful person". We agree. <br /> <br /> The extracted pace spread over a decade perfectly captures Glasnost's institutional inertia - "openness" - it wasn't. The contrast with Perestroika - "restructuring" - could not have been greater for the case. Even though Chikatilo was still driving at railway stations, police plans had to bear fruit. In 1990, Col.Fetisov was quickly promoted to General. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene so that the study could eventually take place without political interference. Staff, communication, advertising - all were suddenly available. In just one night of calling around, Fetisov got his depressed forensic chief access to the FBI's Serial Murder Task Force in Quantico, where Fetisov discovered that the staff were regularly turned of serial killer to avert just such psychological damage to investigators. /> <br /> Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics boss, now "Colonel" Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie's powerhouse landmark scene. Fetisov is the most excuse I have ever seen in movies: "Private, I bid my deepest excuse to you and your wife. I hope you someday can forgive my ignorance, "he whispers almost. <br /> <br /> A HBO production, CitizenX is a movie of the highest quality. exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Randy Edelman's strong soundtrack is overwhelming - and often our only respite from the grim brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> Chikatilo's actual murder is depicted as gloomy, deviant behavior born of inaccuracies and ignorance in an equally gloomy world, which doesn't make the murders all the way out - but of course they were, as President Kennedy reminded us "We all appreciate the future of our children." <br /> <br /> CitizenX perfectly communicates that the killing is far more pungent and indecent than any revenge imagination can mean. Fighters rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. nogl e soldiers, such 'limbic dominators' make poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILS: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrei Chikatilo was the world's most productive known serial killer. Convinced, he was executed in 1992 in the same way as all Soviet death sentences: a shot in the back of the head. Silly, such methods destroy every opportunity to study a deviant brain after death. Conclusion: ------------------------------------------- ------------ The best result is always the prevention of killing, not their prosecution. Decisions only guarantee the society's inability to learn from the complex reality of the victims' death when we even send anecdotal evidence of how / why they died. The killers also do not learn to regret whether they have died. Vengeance does not make unpopular victims. Baying for the killer's blood is nothing better than counter-dominance - when it is too late. Vengeance on behalf of the mourning is not justice for the deceased - it is appeasement for the living. / 10)
