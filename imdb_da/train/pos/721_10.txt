ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to Ramones. I was too young during the band in the mid-1970s to be very attentive to them, even though I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally watched RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid 80's when I was about fifteen years old and laughing all the way through it. (Isn't it every gymnasium's dream to separate his school and blow it up, everything is set to a rockin 'soundtrack?) I recorded a subsequent broadcast of the film a year or two later and watched Ramone's concert sequences over and over, thinking " man, these guys are kicking ass! I have to check some of their albums! " The rest is history. Twenty years, many Ramones LPs / tapes / CDs and three Ramones show later, they are still one of my most popular bands and the RNRHS still cracks me every time I see it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.I.P. all), we have at least this movie and lots of good music to remember them.
