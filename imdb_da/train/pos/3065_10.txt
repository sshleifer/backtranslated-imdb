<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of the rare movies that Hollywood really doesn't do anymore. William H Macy is as big as the hit man with a soul, and Neve Campbell is just plain awesome as the woman who puts her life on the trail of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watch this movie. It does praise it
