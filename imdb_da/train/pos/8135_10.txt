I'm shocked. Shocked and appalled that 428 of you IMDB users who voted for me have not rated this movie over 7. 7 ?! ?? - It's a C! If I could give FOBH a 20, I'd like to do it. This film stands high on top of the modern comedy pantheon along with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most hilarious films of all time. If you know anything about rap music - YOU MUST SEE THIS !! If you don't know anything about rap music - learn something! And then see it here! Comparisons with 'Spinal Tap' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique movie. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this. See it and vote it a 10!
