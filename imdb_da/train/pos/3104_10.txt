This movie was excellent. I didn't expect to live up to all the hype, but it did. Like all Bourne films, the action is quick, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy, you will also love this one. The movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot phrases that are too unrealistic. OK, Julia Stile's character, appearing in the Italian safe house, was a little removed especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she is the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows it won't have him dead and he might trust, and the only person to lead him in the right direction. The action is driven by signs and their reactions to what is happening around them. What I always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt, but when matched with people as good as he is, the fighting fights and he takes a lot of damage in them. They never treat the audience as idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I think Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receive excellent support from Joan Allen, representing his role from Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. However, I miss Franka Potente.
