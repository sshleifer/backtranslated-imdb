14 years ago this show was made and it is still the best show ever made. The script was 1st class and the production something else. This show will never be made today and it is a shame. I hope if you are thinking of finding this show to see that you are doing it. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year I left high school at the time my fav TV show was the x files, this gives you an idea why I first came in on this show. AG was a much better program with better writing, but only got one reason? I know this is not the only program to only get a season. Another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman (x files jumping out) it had good writing and was fun, but also just a season. It doesn't seem right! <br /> <br /> We should also remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows "cool," so I think it might also have let the show go downhill. <br /> <br /> See this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
