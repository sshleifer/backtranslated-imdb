Usually I really enjoy movies like "Chances Are", but I wasn't quite happy with this for a few reasons. The first half was pretty well done together, with Alex Finch dying and reincarnating in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now an adult. The scenes with them meet again, and Downey rediscovered who he once was, well done, and there is a lot of emotion and happiness when Shepherd finally thinks it's really her husband reincarnated, but from there the movie goes downhill. There are several sex-related scenes that completely beat me off, especially Downey and Shepherd, who want to get together again despite the difference in their age now. Then, the film manages to finish in the most satisfactory manner, considering the conditions of the plot. I was disappointed because I didn't expect the movie to be so immoral at the end. There was great potential with this story and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the film is not fantastic. For a better, similar movie, try "Heaven Can Wait." Decent but I really wish I hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the other half. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
