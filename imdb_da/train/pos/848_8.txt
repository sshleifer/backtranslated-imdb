The turning point of "The Matador" comes about half of the film when Danny, an unsophisticated Denver man, sits on the balcony of his Mexico City hotel and enjoys a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's Julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to respond. But did he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, director of "The Matador", presents us with a character, Julian Noble, who shows no redeeming qualities. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny in the bar at Camino Real in Mexico City, he wastes the prayers and tells his new acquaintance what he really lives on. <br /> <br /> Danny, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, seems to be competing against a local outfit that seems to be in the front to get the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls in exchange for the charisma and charm wiped out by the wiser julian. It is not until some time later, on a cold winter night, that the killer looks at Danny's door, asks his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this time that the secret that ties them together is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Acting against type, Pierce Brosnan makes a great contribution to his outrageous Julian Noble. Just to see him go through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots give the right impression of his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the equal part of this strange couple. Hope Davis only appears in a couple of scenes that make us complain about why she was no longer. Philip Baker Hall shows a look like the connection between Julian and his duties. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard's style works with his own material. The musical score is by Rolfe Kent, and the sharp filmography of David Tattersall enhances everything.
