Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian) then I am surrendering right now. In her short skirt, high-top boots and pronounced bristle line, she's a real treasure even though her zombie-like eyeshadow kind of comes and goes. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the cutest of the series. Notice the realistic and revealing wrestling struggle with Bronson until he grimly swallows her on the chin and destroys all the fun. Okay, probably I'll leave my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> This is a very well-produced half hour of the undervalued power behind the series success, Buck Houghton. Of course, the producers will lead the third season with an above-average entry. It's post-nuclear holocaust America (we know because she's part of the invading force), and only American Bronson and Soviet Montgomery are back, along with about twenty tons of realistic wrecks. They walk among the devastation in changing moods, while we wonder how long it will take for biology to drum politics, which of course it does (lucky Bronson). And it's about it. No real talk, except what Bronson has to say, which is pretty overblown. Nevertheless, the manuscript is still entertaining and rather daring for its time, which even suggests that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular Cold War stereotype of the time). In passing, it is quite curious that the very Slavic appearance of Bronson (Buchinsky) would be cast as the American and the shining appearance of Montgomery as the slave. Appearance, it must be the reverse. My guess is that the producers didn't want to throw the American into the physically weaker role the woman has, regardless of appearance. But it may be a bit of the usual TZ scare or atmosphere, but the episode still remains a very, very foreseeable 30 minutes.
