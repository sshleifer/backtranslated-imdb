The original by Barbara Stanwyk is only saved by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are too morally sweet, and the film itself is too dated to be truly enjoyed today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, open-minded single woman who becomes pregnant and denies help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underestimated performance). She raises her daughter, Jenny, played so sweetly by Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately make a life-changing decision. Through the film, there are lots of laughs, tears and memorable moments, mainly between Middle and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars like Jenny's would be a governor who, although wealthy, turns out to be a very good influence on her. If you like Medium, Goodman or just great movies with lots of emotions, you'll enjoy Bette Midler's version of STELLA.
