"Convicts" is very much a third act of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long downturn in a late southern day. And in continuation of the protagonist's life, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration between director Peter Masterson and author Horton Foote. Six years earlier, they worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful", a movie that seems almost action-packed to this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just hardly this side of sufficient. The slow pace gives room for the movie artist Toyomichi Kurita, who infuses the film with the right sense of fragile light and heat. Because this is basically a filmed game with little in the way of editing or managing skill, it all comes to the actor. As far as I'm concerned, there are no errors here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are truly genuine, uninterested in anything besides living. Lukas Haas, a young actor who I was familiar with from "Testament" and "Witness," plays a character very much like his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, a little scared and sad. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is a disservice to this movie. This title, along with the opening scene, seems to create a picture of a much more stringed western type image. If slow-paced stage productions do not interest you terribly, you would also like to pass it on. Otherwise it may be just the movie you want, they made more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
