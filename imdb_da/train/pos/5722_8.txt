This was fantastic. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and gut, it was scary, atmospheric and scary. When the mother tongue was over the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be the water and that Buffy would take away from the dark, eerie shades of the original version. I needn't have been worried. The recorder of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people involved in the original movie at hand, and gave the direction of the movies to the same man. They also put it in Japan in the same place in the same house. In fact, the Japanese instructor made pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference being the casting of American actors. It actually became an advantage when it added the element "Strangers in a Strange Land" to the total horror. Not only were they haunted by a completely scary and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a very foreign country that had difficulty integrating into society. It just added the overall anxiety that was embedded in the movie, and I thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> In fact, Buffy does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fears well. There are none of the clear aleck remarks that are so common for American horror films, or a line that detracts from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easy as good as The Ring, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. I hope the future of the American horror will be closer to the Japanese New Wave of horror that started with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally get movies that can actually be categorized as "Horror" !! 8.10
