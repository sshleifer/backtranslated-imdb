This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It looks like Anchorman in the humor department, but I think it's a better composed movie. It actually has a point. If you want to see a whole lot of T&A, you will be disappointed. Just a good set of movies !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this a great movie. I certainly think Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right. I mean, I don't really like Ebert on most movies, but that's the movie I want to agree on. The film contains a good enough story that it is actually credible that this type of people is out there. There is definitely something to say about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yes, you will laugh when it is discovered, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person he did in this movie and yet it's still fun.
