'' The 40-year-old virgin '' 'made me laugh a lot. I don't care if it is considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoy many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the innocent geek Andy Stitzer, and I think that the scene where Andy has her breast hair removed from wax is one of the coolest, especially because it's real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous, by the way. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a little strange and collects many toys, but seems harmless. One day, when he plays poker with his friends of his work, they discover that Andy is actually ... virgin! And he's already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends try to make Andy sleep with a woman. The problem is the confusion that Andy comes in, especially now that he really starts to suffer from Trish, a woman he met when she bought a DVD player in the shop he is working on.
