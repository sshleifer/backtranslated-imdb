After watching Arthur on television many times, I laughed so hard Dudley Moore's role as Arthur, a happy go-luck lucky millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant / grandfather Hobson was just as charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and saw it despite almost 27 years of passage it is still as fun as it was Liza Minnelli's role as a love interest was fascinating that chemistry between the two was magic. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill resembling national debt, he has no desire to grow up and enjoy acting as a child. His activities are monitored by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud). It seems that no one really cares for Arthur except for him. Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry the terrible blonde socialite Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) for four weeks, he will cut off his son's $ 750 million legacy. <br /> <br /> But Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli) a young working class waitress and tie thief, now he is facing a difficult decision marrying love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur eventually grows and breaks it off with Susan before the wedding and lets him keep both the money and his true love. Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy to everyone
