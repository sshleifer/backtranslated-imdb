This two-party was excellent - the best since the series returned. Sure bits of the story were stuck from previous movies, but what TV shows do not do these days. What we got here was a crackling good sci-fi story. A big big (really scary) monster imprisoned at the bottom of a deep pit, some amazing aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens the revived series has come up with, a set of basic sympathetic and credible human characters ( complete with a few named "consumable" security personnel in true Star Trek mode), some great philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some top-draw special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of this.
