"College Girl Murders" is my first acquaintance with Edgar Wallace's writing work? and generally my first real acquaintance with "Crimea" movies in general ?? And I can say I'm moderately impressed. This thing is really entertaining, although I would never have expected it to be so ?? Goofy! The film has an exciting and neatly folded plot with a healthy dose of humor, flamboyant twists and quite inventive kills. There is some James Bond type of evil mastermind ?? always sitting in the shade and in front of a large screen - recruiting prisoners to kill some girls at a particular college with a new type of poison. There is also a villain with a whip, dressed as a communist CCP member, to get rid of the remaining characters, as too curious teachers and such, as well as a boiling police officer who continues to solve the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had previously known that these Crimean films were so colorful and crazy, I would already have bought a whole collection of them. The Pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it does in the end, and the overload of comic gimmicks on Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins account is sometimes much to swallow, but I don't care because it was weird entertainment. Even the funky 60s soundtrack remained in the head for a long time. It's like a variation on the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
