Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude to sexuality. He has no problem paying tribute to naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, it is when he loses it. He believes that when women actually have sex when they lose any kind of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks through the Hollywood Hills stalking beloved couple at a distance, eventually shooting the men dead with a high powered rifle with a scale. The apparent primary reason for this movie's existence is to pamper sexual activity over and over again. "The story" comes out as more of a reflection. This is required to make many a happy heterosexual man quite happy as we are treated with enough long-lasting scenes of nudity (the ladies here look terribly good-sense clothes) and sex to serve as a big dose of titillation. Of course, when one sees a fair part of it through a range, the creepiness factor shifts significantly and illustrates the compulsion against voyeurism. (For one thing, Mike eyes couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger.) This is all stressed by terribly intrusive if some atmospheric music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those with a lurid trash penchant are bound to enjoy this to some extent. It even includes a lesbian tryst that confuses Mike and makes him insecure * how to * react. It unfolds at a very slow pace, but breaks up with a most entertaining ironic twist. It is a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else will certainly hold some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
