Ghost Train is a nice and entertaining movie, typical of the better British comedians from the 1930s and 40s. The antiques of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they seem to be, but you can overcome that by seeing him as a piece or a curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low budget wartime production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, efficient and it gives some real excitement. Fun for a dark (and yes, storm) night. Light up, take the critic out and enjoy.
