I must have seen this a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw it in B&W at the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set for the kids to watch and make them see it. They do not teach history in school, and it explains the most critical event of the 20th century. It extends their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Immediately, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it describes what leads up to the war and the actual war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your kids with Alistair Cooke's America. Look at them and make them understand. You will be so glad you did.
