Got this show late - believe it was the third and final episode when it was first seen - and was blown away by a social comment that was not seen on American television page 'All in the Family'. <br /> <br /> It was very surprised that CBS itself would run this in the first place. <br /> <br /> Just to say the last time CBS 'had a set' - if you know what I mean - was back in the day of 'Everyone in the Family'. The most controversial decision they are willing to tackle today is how much eye makeup is needed at Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people really, really sour - let them discover truth about themselves. And if you want them willing to pull strings, call and have a work of art removed - let them discover this truth by hearing their own words from their own mouths. <br /> <br /> The Earth men have always been ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. Somehow, it crawled under CBS 'corporate / social / political / censor radar' to get it on the plan (maybe 'big brass' has never seen it right before it finally aired?), But once good' ol middle 'Merika has heard and saw herself being herself - yes, the farm may well be that the message or the messenger does not last long. <br /> <br /> Now, if only the "missing episodes" can find their way on the Usenet or bit torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
