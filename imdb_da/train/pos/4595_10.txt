Jackie Chan's name is synonymous with stunts. This movie never lets you down. The open best chase scene and the last roll down scene from the bar are as risky as a wonder if he knows the meaning of fear. This film comes very close to Jackie's best, which is PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars, where as in this movie Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this movie made Jackie a greatest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee. The movie has great comics as well. What makes this movie work is Jakie's ability to show off his venerable side as he is contracted to the typical martial arts hero. This movie was followed by a successor who was good, but was rather pretty compared to his predecessor.
