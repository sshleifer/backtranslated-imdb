I can't say whether the British comedies produced at Ealing Studios are a savored taste or not, but I'm totally addicted, and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best. There is no need to go into the familiar plot of the threat to both the textile industry and the textile associations of an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows that the na√Øve idealistic Sidney Stratton suffers from the persecution of his polymer vision make it a comical joy. Many of the well-known faces of the British actress world - the nervous Cecil Parker, the superbly incredible Michael Gough, and the unforgettable ruthless Ernest Thesinger - put wonderful performances on. Guinness - as always and forever - is great, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Daphne (as she says the word "Daddy", makes the whole movie worth seeing). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
