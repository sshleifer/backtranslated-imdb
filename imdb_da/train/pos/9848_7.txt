I looked at this movie with my kids eyes and I was not disappointed. The story is known, some abandoned orphans must be brought to his parents by an unlikely trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal) ... And I will not forget to mention the incredible little rage with his hazelnut. This made me really laugh during the whole picture. <br /> In short: it seems fun, and it's a must-see with your kids (they like it).
