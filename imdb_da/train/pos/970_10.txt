Now I have seen many movies in my day, but out of every single one there has been a very selected few who have been really good to me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who's impressed with this movie aimed at a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign films. Almost all the actors are trustworthy, the graphics are decent (which you won't even worry about when you watch the movie. Believe me it would be a silly thing to tell about the graphics), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not only the kids. <br /> <br /> Here's basically what this movie made me do. One made me laugh ... many, two, made me feel the signs you suppose, and three, it's a very uplifting story. At the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure which anime out there has not presented any young child who becomes a great warrior and anything to defeat any great evil. It is a formula that is widely used. But in this case it is forgivable, because even if they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you want to see five years ago, the look of it should not be judged. It's very touching, the end is original and it keeps you in the movie as it supposes. However, if you try to compare this with other movies like "The Never Ending Story" or whatever it will differ from your opinion. See it as it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've been impressed like this. The only other movie where I got that feeling is when I saw the TMNT way back when it came out. There's something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. So over-analyze or don't take the movie seriously, just enjoy it.
