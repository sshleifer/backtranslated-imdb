I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy film b / c of the real meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the fun filled action shown in the movie. I'm looking at the time @ the top about 4 X's a week and I just love it! I wish a sequel had been made to see more of Susan's father in the past and see how Susan shared with her new baby sister and without phone, computers, gameboys or 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as I did, I guess you could say I'm a time on the top fanatic and I don't mind. The little boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adorable I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he has played movies or TV shows?
