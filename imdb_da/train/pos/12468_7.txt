Okay, this movie starts out as a cheesy life policy and doesn't get any better at almost the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff', and the cast is not really aimed at most. In the first half of the film, the little girl scratched my nerves. I don't think this is one of her best plays. The only reason I bought the movie is because it was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it. She's great, but it's not one of her best plays either. The story is based on true events and it helps the movie. In fact, I couldn't even like the movie in the first place and was disgusted when I saw still images of the balloon traveling, I mean. Let it come where it goes out and done with it! But everything is forgiven by the time it reaches the destination and the story comes close. If this does not bring a tear to the eye, nothing will! It's cheesy and predictable, but also makes you feel good to the world again.
