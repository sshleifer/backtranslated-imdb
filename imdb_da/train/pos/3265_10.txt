I've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan ever since I saw his series some years ago !! This movie certainly shows her in her best light yet !! The movie was so wonderfully cast and played !! Occasionally, she falls into some entertaining lines just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everyone really does themselves !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd really made the movie a reality !! Also I loved the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she almost dies when she falls to the floor !! This is movie at its best !!
