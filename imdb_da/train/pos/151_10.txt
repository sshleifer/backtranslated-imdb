Movies are designed to affect the audience and this movie left me speechless. Gorgeously photographed and well-acted with dialogue approaching poetry, the film involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weaves an intense web that doesn't allow me to take my eyes off the screen until the final credits. The story sweeps. It takes the audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human wreckage behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who control the screen. Supporting players are excellent cast and give a true sense of authenticity. The sets, lighting, scenery and movies are wonderful. I absolutely love the photography.
