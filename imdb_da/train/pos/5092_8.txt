I thought King Solomon's mines were beautifully done. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her performance was amazing, but her makeup and hair were not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place for the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was great to see an experienced, robust-looking actor in this role, having sat through movies after films with the fairhaired, shining actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version is not comparable to the 1950's version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were trustworthy, but the two media had to be kept separate. I am looking forward to seeing it again and I hope Patrick Swayze will look at this type of role again.
