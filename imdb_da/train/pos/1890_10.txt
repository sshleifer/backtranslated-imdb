This is one of the movies I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just invincible. I especially enjoy watching him stumble and fall while he's full, going out to the fancy restaurant full and part with the moose. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I've seen this order, but it's fun every time. From the moment Arthur comes to Susan's father's place with the moose, you're laughing pretty much all the time. I remember looking at the lookout for the wave with the moose. It went down just as I had imagined it would be. They were all laughing so hard that it was hard for them to film it. The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His behavior, his one-liners and the way he dealt with Arthur were just as fun. It is always a fun moment when he strikes him over the head with his hat or tells him he is a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to "I need a bath" and the lines that follow.
