I watched this movie in the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then and have recently come to own a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this movie and have been and prayed again and again to see it. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed watching it again, too. Although I have to admit, it is not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I don't have older kids, so I don't know what they would think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter keeps singing them over and over again. <br /> <br /> Hope it helps.
