Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are a few plot holes; yes it has a quality for the television; And yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the book with clear self-promotion. <br /> <br /> Forget all that ... This movie is fun. Fun in a post-school Especially black-of-way, but fun anyway. Virginia Madsen as a mother does a good job ... so good I have to start watching her movie. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons. The rest of the throw also does a fine job. If I were a casting agent, I would scouting some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are above usual TV standards, and the music was really good ... better than several big budget films I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for German noir, this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and undervalued movie, it's good. It's one you can show to your 10-year-old daughter, but also enjoy it yourself.
