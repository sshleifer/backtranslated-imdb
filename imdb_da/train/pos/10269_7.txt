In the classic "The Sting" spirit, this movie hits where it really hurts the heart! A prim, a real female psychiatrist who is hungry for adventure, meets up with the scariest and rotten villains. The vulnerable doctor falls into the career of the badman and asks to be involved in his operation. While the movie moves a little "slow", it's climax and ends amazing! You will especially enjoy how the doctor "forgets himself"!
