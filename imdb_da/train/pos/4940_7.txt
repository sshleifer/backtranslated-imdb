This film is about human relations. Charming, fun and well-written, with meaningful text. It seems that Morgan Freeman is having fun on the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really enjoy her acting. Woman as her is a good motivation to learn Spanish language. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the sweet Paz Vega, the view is seen on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are going. 10 items or less is about the life of life. If you enjoy this movie, see also The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. It's not an action movie or a nude comedy. It's about human relations.
