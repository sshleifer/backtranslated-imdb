I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Why they think it's so bad, etc. It's no worse than anything else out there. Personally, I think "soldier" is a great movie, much better than most other movies in the same genre. Reasons why I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the manuscript (David Webb Peoples), good visual effects and the director (Paul Anderson). I even think this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson who has previously directed the entertaining "Mortal Kombat" and the not so entertaining "Event Horizon".
