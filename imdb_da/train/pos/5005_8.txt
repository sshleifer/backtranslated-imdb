With the films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" under their belt, the good people from the other side of the pond Aardman Animation now introduce us a bit of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts". <br /> <br /> Derived from a short time in their careers, "Creature Comforts" is a slice-of-life show in which extracts of conversations are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort. </ br /> <br /> Aardman Animation went across the country and interviewed people with innocent questions like "Are you a liar?" and then hurry up to ask about their sex life. The answers, while appearing to be boring and earthly, are actually quite fun when you understand, the dialogues come first and the animals are added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person making the statements? One of the characters discusses what he is looking for in a woman, "I like those kind of thin." is an insect, the wandering stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs that discuss odors and odors while sniffing behind a poodle as they talk about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. When "wife" tells the litany that is her health, her long suffering stands by her and says nothing. Although it may take some time for "Creature Comforts" to find the "leg" it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the usual. While there are more reality shows than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Some of the humor may seem a little racy, it's claymation that catches the attention of the kids (like the old Batman series of the 60s, the jokes are subtle enough, the kids won't get them) and that are the jokes that are there for the adults.
