This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen this year. His routine is fun and gives a good conversation with others who have seen it. I highly recommend this one. The part of Europe's history is a bit slow, but the final jokes in French are quite good because you don't have to speak French to get it (though you do, it's still fun). Also sharing about being a transvestite is quite good. The first scene (around San Francisco) is not great but fun the first time. Skip them if you can. It's hardly worth seeing. But this is really a fun, fun stand-up show that everyone should see. "I was dead at that time!"
