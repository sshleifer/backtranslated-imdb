This was one of the wonderful rare moments in T.V. that I wished I had caught forever on VHS. Will it never come again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember sending it once a week, and the wait for the next episode was scary. I'd like to see it all over again. I want to buy it. I want what I can't have. Not even at EBAY. <br /> <br /> So it was by far one of the best series out of the 80s. It should be considered a classic, but is lost in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Sob. <br /> <br /> It was totally appealing, fun, flirtatious and original. Maybe not as Sherlock Holmes original, I actually think Quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky Holmes ever could.
