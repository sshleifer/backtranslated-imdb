Te Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who goes through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom, but it comes at a price. She wants to legitimize photography, but is employed to work for tabloids as a paparazzi. Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. TEa's Nora began to develop into a very memorable character, but the network just didn't support comedy, and they still don't. Even when they downloaded George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and grades. The show was fine at the beginning and the audience got used to it, but the network slips it up like a bad plastic surgery.
