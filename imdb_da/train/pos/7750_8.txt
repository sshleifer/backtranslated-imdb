The barman directed some way the wind blowing as he would sing a dEUS song. Anarchy regulates a logical and common mindset. The story behind this movie is just the way the wind blows. And it can really be refreshing to see if you are prepared and willing. Viewers who say there is nothing to keep the stories together are right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, busy place, and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures silveriness, racism, bureaucracy, addiction and violence that survive undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is entertaining, fun and a little low. The barman's screen debut will not make such an impact as his music debut. In that light, some may be disappointed. But then again, 'worst scenario' will be a subtle subtitle for any way the wind blows.
