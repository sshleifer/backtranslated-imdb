"How to lose friends and alien people" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelity. It's a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about his experiences as a journalist covering celebrities. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a very British journalist taking a job in a famous celebrity magazine in New York. Young is restless in getting caught all kinds of shenanigans to alienate the whole of him, hence the movie title. He is rebellious, bold and moronic. But nevertheless, he is a somewhat sympathetic character for some very unusual reasons. Sidney befriends a co-journalist, composer Alison Olsen, played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney wants first and foremost the sex actress Sophie Maes, played by the amazing Ms Megan Fox. This foxtrot is concise on working skill, but high on "eye candy" material. Sidney comes in all kinds of tomfoolery to move the journalist ladder in the magazine co. It's the movie's top comedic moments. However, I believe that director Robert Weide and scriptwriter Peter Straughan may lose some viewers and alienated authentic rum-com material by developing an incredible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison; even though Team Weidstraughan formulated an entertaining story otherwise. Pegg pointed his character down to the thread with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges once again built "The Dude" bridges with his enigmatic support as Clayton Harding, the suave prez of the magazine. But the rest of the movie's plays were not worthy enough to work here. "How to lose friends and alienating people" should not be completely excluded, but you may lose some movie friends if you publish it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
