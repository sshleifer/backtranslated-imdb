I own this movie and have seen it several times over the years since it was released. Prince does not hit us with his phenomenal play or anything he is a musician, and I have what he has shown here, he is just the best to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish, but it is director / author's fault, but it is still a good movie with even better music. Purple Rain's principles and moral beliefs are quite strong, and if more films were to rely on the basics we are taught as toddlers, we would have a better environment around that art reflects the life that reflects art.
