This movie is a fantastic non-stop laugh riot with all the usual ingredients in a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes, buffoonish supporting characters, makeup dolls for heroines, nasty villains, wisecracks, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small dose of action. <br /> <br /> Both Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are in dual roles of police officers and conmen. Amitabh's heroine, the policeman, is Ramya Krishnan, and Raveena is opposite the Govinda policeman. Brains are just rouge-smothered props as usual. Conmen has no heroines. Paresh Rawal carries his villainous action in DAUD forward (he also played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT as well). Asrani shines in a short role. He is resuming his famous "Angrezon ke Zamaane ke Jailer" act in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is impeccable as usual - like a wisecracking, godmothered policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a conman Chhote Miyaan. He mimics the Bihari style of Hindi, spoken with fun results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison with him. But still AB is fine. Madhuri Dixit makes a como like herself in the song "Makhna". She dances like wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is amazing. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for any LOGIC as it is a comedy and the script is practical. Just enjoy yourself.
