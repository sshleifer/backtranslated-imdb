Bunny comes home 'This Man's Navy' deserves more credit than it gets, a wise script by Borden Chase, directed by Wild Bill 'Wellman, the movie has just the right feeling for early post WW11 euphoria and goodwill, and none of the blind terror that came into play some years later. Produced in 1944, the Japanese defeated, the fighting scenes slightly déjà vu, Tom Drake's melancholy attraction for brilliant young Jan Clayton has solid chemistry, plays genuine and validates Drake's career at the Metro. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel.' Wally Beery, a little bleed-eyed, boasts an always incredible Jimmy Gleason ?? his memories are an improvement over reality and gives Beery a Ulysses-like shadow to play against. Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) shots are authentic, photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is out of March AFB. Party 3 doubled to India and Rabbit's U-tour ?? Bunny comes home ?? gives back to Beery a true piece of his past, something he had wanted to believe was true ?? So is the future we spin in again fantastic? Now on a larger scale, a newly designed Navy LTA with launch features for a reconnaissance plan? how expensive, happily optimistic ?? Still: "You must believe it, that's how you make things happen?"
