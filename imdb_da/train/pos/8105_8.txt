SYNOPSIS The future seen from 1939 England. As war dared over Europe, man's salvation will not be found in past politics. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT WITH VIEWER Take care of your leaders and what you are told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter morning. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. PROS AND CONS I watched this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the Internet (it is public domain). This is a fascinating work on many levels. Since it is a story of the future seen from 1939, it has obvious error. This vision of the future is both scary and moody. This movie was the tip of his day. The special effects are very good, just like the story line. The actor suffers a bit in the British theatrical sense, because it can lean slightly against Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems we now know are not always true. The movies second plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> Support for almost any later science fiction movie can be seen in this movie. It puts the design and wardrobe of the "Forbidden Planet", the lack of technology in "2001: A Space Odessy", even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of "Star Wars" owe some inspiration to this movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie leaves the viewer a little confused. While it is optimistic in its final order to reach the stars, we are wondering if mankind will ever be able to do it. Even when we reach, there are those who try to hold us back. This film's vision of the future, while being interesting, is also a bit humorous of today's standards. Huge airplanes and weapons that could shoot people into space were never realized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. Many great British actors are in this movie as young men. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized, and their dissemination skills are evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the protagonist, Cabel. His character almost comes as the new Christ sent to save the world from his own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of movie history, whose themes are still relevant today, even though its future vision lacked the mark.
