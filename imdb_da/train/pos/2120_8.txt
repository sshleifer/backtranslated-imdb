James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play colleagues in a gift shop in Budapest who do not really like each other, without knowing that they are really sweet penpals who have not yet met. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, very engaging game of it is two sympathetic stars and a very keen to please support cast. The story is well-written and the film has the romantic innocence (don't really know how to explain it) that movies today just don't have. This can of course be compared to the latest you have received mail, and the original wins in every way. <br /> <br /> This is mandatory to watch every Christmas, I can't think of a better way to jump a Christmas on the feel than this little gem.
