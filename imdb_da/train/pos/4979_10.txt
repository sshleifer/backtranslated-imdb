This is the second Baby Burlesque that is short to be released, and probably the most popular is a spoof of the 1926 audio movie What Price Glory. I saw this and I don't understand kiddie porn it claimed. It's just a cute little movie. I've seen family shows that I grew up in the 80s and 90s, having little girls dressed in more provocative acts in a 'mature way'. It was more provocative because they were not dressed in diapers. There is nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of these fetishes. (just a joke) I read this description of the movie and where it says only a pedophile would enjoy watching this. It's sick. For me, if you see this and are bothered by it, then you may have to look at your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you. It's an innocent movie made like a parody of another movie. All the B.B. movies were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / spoofs are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and rather vain language. Shouldn't they be more terrible? I can see them without a problem, but they sometimes take children's stories and shame them on these parodies. That's what has to come under your skin. Not that they babified (not a word I know) an adult movie from 1926 because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC the silent movies were, huh? Not to mention these "Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Code era movies" looked silly and dirty. They would never do such filth today? (note the sarcasm)
