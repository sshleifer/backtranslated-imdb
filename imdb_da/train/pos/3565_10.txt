Guys and Dolls is a unique game based on the characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a first-class gambler who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he can <br /> <br /> run his usual crap game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky would not be able to take a girl to Havana, Cuba and the "doll" he chose was Sarah. <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons), who was responsible for a missionary. Sky finally bets <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They end up falling in love with each other, but later she accuses him of something he had no role in. Nathan ran a staple in the missionary the night they were away. Nathan's 14-year-old Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disapproves of Nathan's game and tries to stop him from doing so. But when the film ends, everything ends with a double wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just wonderful, no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no song voice at all and indeed they could have called him, but it wasn't really anything. He did a wonderful acting job (obviously see it as Brando) and played his character very well. I watched a few movies with Jean Simmons and thought this movie was her weakest, she couldn't even <br /> <br /> sing at all. But the song consists of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original <br /> <br /> Broadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a fantastic voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like musical and even if you don't, I advise you to watch this.
