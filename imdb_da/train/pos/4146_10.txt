Anyone who lived through Nerd's and Girlpower's revenge will appreciate this movie. It's one of the movies that delivers everything you want in a "spring break movie" PLUS that makes fun of college movie genre. It's fun it's been thrown to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch! Sophie Monk! Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missy Pyle!) And it's guaranteed you laugh aloud. Writer / actress Rachel Dratch is a comic genius, and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I'm just repeating now ...) It'll continue with girls who like Miranda July, but want to eat ice cream and pretend to be stupid.
