I find Alan Jacobs review very accurate with the movie, but I had the opportunity to rent the DVD from blockbuster with a comment from the BYUs Curator, Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc. The then LDS prophet Heber J. Grant approved the film's understanding of the deviations from historical content to dramatic expressions and telescopic events. For example, the movie Joseph Smith proved. in spite of Brigham Young's great oratory in defense of Joseph Smith, he was still sentenced. Then Joseph was killed. Historic Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, both of whom killed before the trial took place.
