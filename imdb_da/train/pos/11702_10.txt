A thief at night has to be the best of all the final tensions. I have no idea what people are complaining about what people are looking at when they say these movies scared them to accept God. They should just find an apology and blame a thief at night. Don't listen! These films not only tell you about one of the many possibilities of the tribulation, but it is also fun to see in their simplicity. They are actually low budget and it is a little obvious, but not too obvious at first view. I had no idea that I really assumed that many movies like these made in the 70s included low budgets all the time. A thief at night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers living for what comes her until her husband, and almost all of his friends disappear in the prophetic rapture that everyone warned her about. In the beginning, the film is not entirely based on her before cleanup occurs. What it leads to shows that everyone else around her becomes Christian and believes in Christ, which is usually what happens to many people. Everyone around them who once knew and loved will be gone forever, and the one who is left behind is the one who thrives all but himself. No one can never blame himself for always being right. <br /> <br /> Like those whiners complaining about the movie. These people should be adult adults. I'm thirteen, and you can't see me whining, especially as I was like Patty before I resumed Christ in my heart. For those who haven't seen it, if you want a little bit of everything thrown into a Christian movie rather than stereotypically, everyone else is wrong movies than you will enjoy a thief at night. Don't beat it before trying it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
