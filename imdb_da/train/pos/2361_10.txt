I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an emergency care medical facility. Over the years, I have seen that people die from haemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have participated in many conferences on blood-borne pathogens, and have seen that more patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood. I have also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood, and after 26 years on the course I have never seen it happen, and the question "is it really unreasonable to deny blood transfusions or is society at large benefit of the struggle for this question? "The problem for Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral one. "You must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thanks for this movie and allow comments on it.
