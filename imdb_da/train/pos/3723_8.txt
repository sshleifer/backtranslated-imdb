There is an inexhaustible hunger for "basic training film", so it is surprising that it became so unnoticed when it was first released. It seems likely to have a well-deserved second life on DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tigerland is not uniformly large in any way, there are some terribly cliched characters (especially the NCO's depiction, making you long for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket' Ermey), but Colin Farrell's leading achievements are those instant star stuff. Charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get.
