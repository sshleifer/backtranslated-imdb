Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-crafted film. The actor Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as zero were the roles very well cast, and the actors portrayed their roles. <br /> <br /> The movie had interweaving stories that all led to the end. The main story is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment for spending one and a half years at Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism, and that is the deeper story in the movie. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explain the 100-year-old curse on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these storylene were very well interwoven. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many people's beliefs, I think you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. The movie is reasonably easy to understand. The action in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (warden) and Jon Voight (Sir). The other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-ray). But the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a good team together. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney movie, it's about some serious issues like racism, shootings and violence. The film's dramatization on some points is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether or not they have read the book. You should not miss it.
