John Singleton's finest movie, before the magnificent wannabees as Shaft remake, is a thought-provoking movie with grandiose and stunning balance between the stories of 3 protagonists, each with identifiable youth problems. What I like Most about it also covers the problem of self-determination among young blacks, a problem that is mostly ignored by the media and other films that mainly focus on social and economic problems and racism of whites. This movie shows that blacks can be just as ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The masterful thing about this movie is that it deals with so many topics without becoming superficial. It's not just about racism, but about how difficult it can be to adopt a new world (college), rape, discover sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each deliver fine performances, and the supporting spirit is as interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a lez (yay) and with ice cube and Busta Rhymes as college pimple causing small disintegration. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the caricature of a professor at Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Of course, many professors are careful. But they are not so flat. Skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but I think they are also in real life. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great underestimated movie work, if you liked American History X, you'll love this one. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
