This interesting Giallo increases a typical but still exciting plot and a truly sadistic killer who, of course, likes to hunt down his victims before they kill them in evil ways. Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, who one year earlier, also made the very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment to the one), the film starts a bit slowly, but all in all, no time is wasted unnecessary sub-areas or sequences. <br /> <br /> This movie is a German-Italian co-production, but it was only released in Germany on video in a version trimmed by a 15 minute plot under the stupid title "Horror House". At least, the murder scenes, which will satisfy all gorehounds, will be completely intact, and the viewer still gets the murderer's motive at the end. But the Italian version, which contains all the pictures, is of course still the right one. <br /> <br /> A compelling Giallo with mandatory twists and red herring, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Set Volte" is highly recommended for Giallo fans and slightly better than Miragla's other thriller mentioned above.
