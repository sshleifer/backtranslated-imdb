Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. When I watched this movie, made in 1988, in 1999 I thought I was looking at O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have very different opinions about the individual's innocence in each situation). <br /> <br /> The Australian news media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of a possible child murder and truth was left as an afterthought. It was frightening to see the scenes of invasive, swarming media hordes, ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies, and debates over the supposed benefits of the matter of people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> just as appalling is the media's portrayal as indifferent and incomprehensible to the technical details of the case. I want more of the issue of religious prejudices in the case to be made (the accused are seven-day Adventists). Today, these circuses have become commonplace, but this only makes the lesson more important. /> <br /> Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I have ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accents get a little thick at times, but not incomprehensible.
