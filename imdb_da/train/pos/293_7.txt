What could be more schlocky than the idea of ​​private detectives getting involved with the women they were to spy on? And most of the written dialogue is perfectly banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors make the dialogue something that makes sense. You can see real people behind the unreal lines. And the steering is wonderful. Each scene does just what it should and ends without dragging too long. <br /> <br /> I showed this to more friends in the mid 80's because I was confused about how such a bad material could be made such a good movie. Friends also enjoyed it.
