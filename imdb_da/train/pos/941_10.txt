I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. In fact, I expected to watch the movie when it was announced, and it was more than lived up to my expectations. I have now bought the DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's a wonderful life," I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and an excellent cast leader by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott once again shows that he is one of the finest actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acts the ability to play every role and keep the character unique to himself. How can you be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge? Scott makes it easy. The direction is marvelous with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special sense of time, place and era depicted. You will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
