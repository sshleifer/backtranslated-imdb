Well, after a while, I'm used to reading comments on those movies that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous films. He was a drowsy villain, an apologetic villain. For me it was a fresh air to see him in a role where his villain is not a kind of undercutting in one way or another. The child who played Aryan was probably over his head with this body. I think maybe the director could have done better. But to be honest, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I have to say that I greatly appreciated her contribution when she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She must get a little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she sailed just over the head of most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So if you're used to settling on the Bollywood average, you won't get much from this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, then it can give you some of what you lacked.
