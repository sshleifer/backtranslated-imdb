I think many viewers completely missed the fact that this is, of course, a parody of Western films. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it is a smart tongue in the cheek of the Western. I do not think this movie took a minute in earnest. What makes this movie even more unique is that it is centered around 4 strong beautiful women, two of whom are black, an Asian and a Mexican / Latin character. <br /> <br /> These are not your usual western women - they are tough - they can pull fast and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> They're so hard even though the bartender shakes when he pours their whiskey. The plot, which moves this story together, is typical of Westerner - in the way of "you shot my brother - I saw" I get you! "Only in this Western is a woman's sister shot, and she is out of revenge on the gang, It did. <br /> <br /> So she walks and rounds up her old comrades from her bank robbing days. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really interested in awakening Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by gold and jewelry hidden in the city where they are heading. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of scenes that do not make sense, not that they disturb so much, they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. So the movie can use a little tightening, but everywhere it is a well-made movie that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbians in movie are a villain - of "heroines", one of course is equal, the other sexual orientations are never published. <br /> <br /> 7 Stars
