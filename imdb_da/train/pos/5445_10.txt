I first saw this movie about ten years ago and I thought it was really fun. It wasn't as bad as some critics made it to be. The fact that it was written by the usually reliable John Hughes shows that at least one can expect a fun dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is quite good, which was also written in the lightning speed of Hughes). <br /> <br /> The film has a really smooth look with all the primary colors - red, yellow etc - making it look unique. Cast is also pretty good. Prudish Bunny Packard and the devil-possessing Delores Salk are a stand out. <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly a little dated, but I prefer it personally to all the other 'Lampoon' series.
