I just watched Holly with another film about human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children called Trade at Film by the Sea international film festival. I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie at many levels. From a purely artistic and cinematic perspective, it is fantastic. Sound mixing, camera angles, steering and acting are all on the spot. <br /> <br /> Also, the way it handles the item is tasteful and non-utilizing. It presents the issue of sexual exploitation of children in a way that is both educational and accurate. The filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to details that really caught the nuances of the epidemic of sexual exploitation and child trafficking. All too often when dealing with a subject of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I've had the pleasure of watching Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I've never seen the audience move any more. Just listening to conversations after screening asks people what they can do personally to combat child sexual exploitation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both for its film value and its subject matter.
