As a native of Bolton, this film has obviously appeal to me. The location images are fascinating and show a Bolton much in transition - there are a number of scenes of apparent obsolescence, but it serves to show the city being rebuilt - and the idea that the old man must make room for the new is at the very center of this. movie. A little misunderstanding James Mason leads a comfortable ensemble in a story of a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full blown generation's conflict, so a pleasing skmaltzy resolution. Although I am a little too young to remember it fully, the minutiae of Lancashire's life in the 60s here is: Friday deposit, songs around the piano, Sunday's constitutional, good neighborly, fear of the hip, the massive importance of self-respect, and I was happy to see Naughton's most fun lines from the game back intact. There is no doubt that this film should be made available on the DVD - it is well designed and most performances are well developed.
