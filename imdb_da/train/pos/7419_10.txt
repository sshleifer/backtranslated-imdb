Based on the example I had seen, I went to "Shower" and expects a cute little comedy; What I found was a deeply moving drama of family life that was told in some of the most lush photographic images I've ever been privileged to see. In addition, I got subsequent reflections on the sudden cuts to past scenes (in the dry landscape of northern China and in the high plain of Tibet): Isn't that how memory often works? For a moment I am here, the next I am in a landscape of the past, like that .... I would not only strongly recommend this movie, I would place it among the two or three finest movies I've seen in my 60 years. By the way, some years ago, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States as "Do we dance?" (Japanese). As with "Shower", the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of the movie that turned out to be a subtle psychological study (albeit shock full of fun moments). Is there a fear of distributors about making the films "important" or "deep" to appeal to US viewers?
