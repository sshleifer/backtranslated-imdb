Why does it sound like the man kept calling her Appy? It ruined a major episode, and then I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are crucial to a movie. <br /> <br /> It was very Hellraiser, what about the whole skin ripping, though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin, the skin is a vital body to the body, the largest body actually and without us dying.
