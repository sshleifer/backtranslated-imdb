Good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was compelling. Garrison's affair with First Lady was unreal and passive; The president was a cardboard cut-out. And who were the real villains anyway? Nothing was adequately developed or explained. I still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mule was involved. The bad guys were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - chase and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both incredible in their roles, Basinger was lacking in character and in no way could Longoria have been a Secret Service Agent. This could have been a very good movie, but somehow missed out on too many unanswered questions. Disappointing at all despite some very good scenes. And did they use the 'West Wing' set for the white house scenes? - I still waited for CJ or Charlie to show up!
