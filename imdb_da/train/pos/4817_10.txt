The Young Victoria is a beautiful movie and has presented Queen Victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks of her. The movies are wiping away from the "Queen Victoria" and I show that she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> When I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw This movie was announced, I was so so excited and talked down in the days until it came to the theaters . I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically correct, but it was and I loved it. I found out new facts about Queen Victoria who didn't know before, and I was very interested. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many light was one of our highest monarchs, and this film paints a picture of her real personality and how her life was. She was treated so badly by her mother adviser Sir John Conroy because he wanted Britain to have a regency. That's what inspired Victoria to be a great queen she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep, and this was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both of whom were brilliant! The Young Victoria is a heart-felt love story but at the same time a good look at much of British history ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
