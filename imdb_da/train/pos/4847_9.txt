This movie is one of those nostalgia things with me, and I never expect anyone else to "get it," but I'm happy when I recommend it and someone enjoys it. My late father HATED Arthur Askey, but this movie was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" was transferred to me as a child. Years later I see it again and again and enjoy the confidentiality. I always wonder if it won't be exactly the same, but I'm never disappointed with it. There is a lot to enjoy. The sequence of the train is really inspired when Askey and Murdoch continue to annoy the arrogant man passages. Then the whole section of the station is great, so much you have to quit. Yes, it is dated and full of wartime British accents and plot (based on Arnold Ridley's original game of father's army fame!) But full of wonderful character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster. The atmosphere is really as creepy as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get. This is available cheaply as chips in the UK on DVD, so treat yourself. It is a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight entertainment. I thank .... OLD FILM CAN BE GOOD MOVIE!
