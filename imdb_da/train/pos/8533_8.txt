This movie is more lupine than most, especially from Funimation. Other than the bad dub, it's not bad. The first hour is much like the comic (which is what all lupins are the third thing based on). Lupine tries to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses lupine's weakness for women to try and get something out of it. The last bit is not that bad, he is with another woman, but of course Fujiko is still him number one. Many of the other Lupine movies are more family with cuss words than Lupine. Any good Lupine fan I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I had heard so many bad things about this movie). It can be a little better without the small animations rolling under the credits (they make it a bit mushy), but generally it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few I wanted to see again on the Lupine III films.
