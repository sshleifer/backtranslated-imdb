I loved watching '' Sea Hunt '' back in the day, I was in high school and would come home doing my homework and at 4:30 am would be ready to see '' Sea Hunt '' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventure. I loved it! He took you to a place that wasn't very accessible at the time of the Great Blue Sea. Pre '' Thunderball '' or even before Cousteau became commonplace, Mike Nelson kicked the child's imagination. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the natural sciences from seeing this show. Underwater photography also developed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated through watching this show. See and enjoy !!!
