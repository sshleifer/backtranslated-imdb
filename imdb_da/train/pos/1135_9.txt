I saw the first thing in the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really in the movie that made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast, many big names in it, some of which were not as recognized as they are now. I think it's a good idea if you follow any of these actors, or have loved them in other movies, to add it to your watch list. Some of the scenes actually remind me of that well-designed comedy as in The Birdcage or even The Clue, kind of unhappy spontaneous-looking comedy, with some really professional delivery from those beloved actors. The film did a good job of giving you an insight, perhaps even very realistically, into the culture of a daytime lap.
