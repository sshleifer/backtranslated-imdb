What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function? Where alone can a man get? When the human bush that we have to do to be part of society becomes too much, what happens? Frownland is exploring these issues. Absolutely an outrageous original debut from Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic, as we enter the mind of a guy named Keith who is so messy that he can hardly form a proper phrase. We follow him around as he tries to get in touch with people and work daily. Most of us have known people like this - people who say "sorry" too much or "I appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people out there like this, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because it's interesting and Bronstein and the main actor, Dore Mann, do an excellent job. This movie is about as non-commercial as a movie can get. A few friends filmed it in a few years when they saved money. It was shot at 16mm and the scratched movie look is beautifully low budget. No distributor can find it hard to find, I think it has been randomly screened for the last year or so. Hopefully it will be on DVD at some point. I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, among them Crispin Glover, if it tells you something about how strange this movie is. Highly recommended.
