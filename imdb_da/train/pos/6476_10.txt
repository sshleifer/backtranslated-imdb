A number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex dramas. Crime is essentially banal, so wages are always anti-climactic, while detailed exhibits degrade human drama. The author has used a number of clever devices to try to get around this, but has not been entirely successful. Answer exactly what happened and why may have been delivered, but if they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a bit cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a way it's insignificant. The drama was never about the crime, or even the investigation, about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such it was poignant. The script was a significant cut across the keel's race for prime-time drama, and the performances were similarly good. In an ensemble piece, it is offensive to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as a mother-daughter, and Janet McTeer was in a cracking form as a hard-bitten old politician. <Br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of drama is the handling of races, like the elephant in space, which no one is willing to mention. Subtle, powerful stuff.
