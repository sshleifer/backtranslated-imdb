No hidden agenda. Clean scifi. Everything fun. <br /> <br /> I watched the original on TV and was scared pretty bad. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be appreciated more for the new one I saw and forgot. The original, starring with the big movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and only version everyone should see. <br /> <br /> Film production is dated, but for example, used to make Blob stands up the test of time. I was convinced that it was moving on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
