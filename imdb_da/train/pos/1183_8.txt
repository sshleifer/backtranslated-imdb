A man adjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the problem of the family milk cow, Tulip, who refuses to allow himself to be milked. Until that, he visualizes his wife, who was the one who used to milk Tulip. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a real story told in Griffith's family of his grandparent's generation. The film is a nostalgic look back in a vanishing lifestyle, one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other, set in the lush green Victorian (the Australian state, not the era) in the countryside. <br /> <br /> Author and director Griffiths apparently has further ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15 minute card is a great start to her reel.
