Some people think the second series was where Scooby was destroyed. I disagree completely. showing the quality did not go up or down and scrappy, winning my opinion as a very good chrecter.i looked at a poll at jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said the scrapie's second series was scooby's downfall. OK so loads said yes, but 28% still can't be wrong. I like the way most of the episodes focused on comedies. I think the show would have gone wrong if it was the same 5 people / dog solves the mystery in the same formula.scrappy was a fresh breath for show.sure, some people tuned out, but when scrappy was introduced viewing characters DOUBLED. Back to show.All episodes and segments were very fun. I was inspired by yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day, it's a matter of meaning, if you like scrappy or not, a matter of meaning is certainly no circumstance involved. But in my opinion, it was a fantastic series that gave a start to tired showing a new formula and lease of life. Nuff said.
