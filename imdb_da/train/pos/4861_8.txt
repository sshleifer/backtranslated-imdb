Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The reason for it is about a British woman (Fontaine) who is in love with an American who fails for Astaire, a musical comedian. The movie, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice Work, If You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number that takes place in a fun house. <br /> <br /> Astaire singing voice sounds more robust in this movie than it does in others, and he has a few excellent dance songs. Burns plays his top publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She is funny. The problem others have pointed out is Fontaine, who is going to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it happens among the trees. I would have thought it was a double except the dance was so miserable. Definitely worth seeing despite its shortcomings.
