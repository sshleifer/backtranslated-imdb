Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) was the second movie that stole the pot loving duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The beloved burned smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building and look for ways to score more smoke and lay just during the day. But Cheech is the "responsible" one. He has a job and a stable girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to get his freak on, so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem also arises, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech is another role) is in town and wants to hang out with him. Firguring that he could kill two birds with a stone, Cheech ties Chong off and Red. What kind of adventure does Chong and Red come into? Will Cheech get his freak on? How long will Chong go without any smoke? Just see CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE to find out! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong takes over the ruling governments for the successor. He got some experience when he did some unredited work at UP IN SMOKE. Fun but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
