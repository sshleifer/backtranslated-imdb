I watched this movie in Winnipeg recently - appropriately, given the location. I first read Lawrence's book back in the 70's, and for me it has always been a very strong picture of aging tests in our society. It resonated when I was young, and it is even more so now. When the movie came out, I was eager to see if the story could survive. and was thoroughly impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. She manages to give us a complete human being, although the character is generally sharp and judgmental - a person whom you do not want to live with. It is great to see that favorite people come to life so authentic.
