Beautifully and intelligently played by the two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is a bit of the imagination. Young Hazel running for mayor seems to be out of place, to be honest. <br /> <br /> While the play is well done by all concerned, the movie tends to lack a true atmosphere of drama. Perhaps we have grown to expect a greedy reality in movies, rather than comparing Pollyanna to how green was my valley! Remember, each one is good in their own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, though her role is somewhat subdued here. In the middle of road entertainment suitable for younger viewers, and how cozy at times to be exposed to fine classical music that is almost rare! <br /> <br /> I find this movie a welcome change as it reflects quieter, thought-provoking values ​​for the growing years and no violence thank goodness. A warm family movie to enjoy.
