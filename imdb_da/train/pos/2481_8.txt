I admit that I've only seen about three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet), one I liked, the other I found half-day (Macbeth) and Hamlet, I just found a masterpiece. I'm happy to tell you that this adaptation is as good as the intense and dramatic game. The action is extremely strong (with a throw containing Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?) And change in time period (Looks like somewhere between 17 and 1800) is played beautifully as the characters move around and theirs infamous lines from the very script, any fan of the Shakespeare game will have chills. If you are in this popular drama, I strongly urge you to see this powerful 1996 adaptation by Shakespeare Admiral Kenneth Branagh.
