Since this film is entirely in Swiss dialect, it is probably hard for most German speakers to really follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I've been working there for some years so I had the chance to understand this great spear of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen many movies of this kind (eg Scary Movie, lots of Scifi spoofs, etc.) But this one is the best of the kind I've seen so far. I give a 9 out of 10. The only reason I can't give a 10 is because there are some small details that could have been done better and because they didn't deliver any subtitles in any language on the DVD so there is almost no chance of non-Swiss understanding.
