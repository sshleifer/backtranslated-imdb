I don't know if I'm just curious, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to the lake cabin, of course, is the sequel to another of my favorite movies Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I enjoyed this movie even more than the first. I also thought the role of this movie was amazing, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second movie focused on the movie of Stanley's play Cabin by the Lake - it was not a completely redundant movie by Stanley who grabbed other girls and drowned them. - If you are looking for a deep meaning, then this movie is probably not the only one for you. But if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and see it. I've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
