I first saw this movie when I was about 13. It blew me away so and in many respects it still does now. But I'm less likely to see it as a precise historical piece now. There is precious effort to investigate and interact with racism - and thus not to recognize that the most potent anti-racial weapon is to understand it as the core of those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one hand, beko and forest in 3D panorama rainbow vision - on the other hand, two-dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil. <br /> <br /> It all makes a great movie story, but it worries me that people see the picture as "accurate".
