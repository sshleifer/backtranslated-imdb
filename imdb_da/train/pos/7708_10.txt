Shakespeare's "The Tempest" is a model for this extraordinary science fiction movie. We look for differences. Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, are stranded on a Mediterranean island. "Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet around Altair. Ariel is a spirit Robby the Robot is a man-made servant. Caliban's evil almost does not approach monsters of Id. Shakespeare Parts Prospero. Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up." Tempest "is a comedy." Forbidden Planet "is a tragedy. We are wondering if humanity should suffer the fate of Krat in the future. Francis is Altaira. Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman. Kelly played with James Garner in comedy / Western TV series , "Maverick."
