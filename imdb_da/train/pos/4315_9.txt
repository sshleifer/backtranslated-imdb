I just watched this movie again and remain horrified at the number of cynics who reject it as just New Age cardboard. A big movie that takes its time to evolve is about to go over the edge, but it never does and ultimately is meditative, influencing and threatening to life than most movies that people who rejects its "coincidences" can see. I was sad at the time when movies like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (though I liked the latter) were nominated for the best picture that year (let alone "the Lamb's silence" won!) And it was completely ignored except for a nomination for best manuscript. By revising it, I think the story supports my first reaction!
