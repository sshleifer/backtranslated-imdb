STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Okay ** You could go for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Stuck-up career bitch Kate ( Franka Potente leads the London underground to take a train to take her to George Clooney. But after a hectic working day she turns off and awakens to find herself alone in an abandoned platform. As she runs out of a situation that takes her from a frightening meeting to the next, she learns something more vicious and evil waiting for her out there. In many ways, Britons The British Film Industry really becomes one of its own, especially in the horror thriller department, with movies like Creep and the successful 28 Days Later (as this has strong echoes in parts.) In terms of succeeding in what should make Creep create wisely (especially in the beginning) a frightening sense of isolation and tense fear. On the clever run time, it also (though unintentionally misunderstands) manages to pay tribute to some of these pioneering concept of horror films from the 70s, which rely on shock and fear review without focusing too much on character development and such. <br /> <br /> Of its weaknesses, some scenes are somewhat predictable, but it doesn't succeed in making it less intimidating or effective in any way. I'm not sure if the end was meant to make it come as a kind of moral game, and it's not quite perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves the basic function very well. ***
