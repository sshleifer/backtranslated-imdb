I really enjoyed this movie. The play was amazing as it was plotted. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is known for. The only part of this flick I would change was the end. The death of the closet was far too cruel for the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Of course, Jeff Combs played a Messiah figure, and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that had the 'end of the world'. I only noticed this after my third display of this classic creation feature. I know that many people do not get references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you get it.
