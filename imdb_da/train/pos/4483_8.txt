Everything a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a note. Scenes with them together are very good and show how much talent can be added to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's "I fall in love with easy" is an indication of his best future and future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is lovely. Kelly certainly earned her nomination as the best actor. And there is a bushel of really fun lines, like: "You think the fleet is taking dopes?"; "Do you think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; and "we got some problems, we picked up a small child." A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing that shakes the dust of a recent World War II.
