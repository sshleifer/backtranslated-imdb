Had this film been made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. But for 1909 this was a dandy little movie and still stands up well today. Just try not to compare this silent movie to later silents - the industry changed so radically that the shorts from the first decade of the 20th century did not look at anything like movies made in the 1910s and above. <br /> <br /> This movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most movies) and is a variation of the Edgar Allen Poe story, The CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with history, I will not elaborate further as I will not destroy the movie. Just enough to say it's very creepy !!
