It's hard to say what comes out at the top, James Cagney's charm and energy or mouth opening overruns of Busby Berkeley's three great show stoppers nearby. I give it a tie, with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and fastest of the early thirties musicals. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds immensely to the good-natured story. <br /> <br /> And what is the story line? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals and is now almost out of service, as talkies take over. He starts making Prologues, live musical entertainment is offered on stage before a movie starts. He gets the idea to make bigger and more of them and move them around the country. He is a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. But a rival spies on him and steals his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his vice-craving secretary, loves him, but he is too busy to notice; An office girl in black round, round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns out to say that she does not differ from a blonde gold digger, putting her hooks in him; his partners cheat him ... my treasure, what's next? It can all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens quickly, with Cagney jumping, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last issue when he goes out and sings and dances - makes a move or two just to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's put a show, gang" we have "We'll build three shows in three days, then lock the doors and let's start practicing." These three super-prologues will feature 40 choruses, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses ... the entire Apollo movie house circuit! Exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all the non-image choruses in skimpy costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; you can quickly see Sothern, but Lamour is more generic) hold the course, dance their hearts, giggle and talk and see remarkably rough. <br /> <br /> And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after another the same night, where the owner of the Apollo circuit decides at night whether he will save Chester's skin or not. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler is in a 9 minute production number that includes a lot of healthy liveliness, with brides and grooms (some may even be married), bedrooms and beds and doors with "do not disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> So on to the next theater and 11 minutes of "At a Waterfall", which probably had the Warner Brothers accounts concerned about bankruptcy. This number is so exaggerated - dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a large cave with water slides, a huge pool - you would never think there was a depression on. Berkeley pulls all his tricks out - synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms make all kinds of precision types - and he does it in the water, with much underwater photography looking up. The girls are safe games. They come up with smiles with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. It must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a few quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a little gently. <br /> <br /> And finally, the smash final ... 11 minutes Cagney dances and sings with Keeler to "Shanghai Lil" with all sorts of bar girls and their customers, unusual, because the races are mixed up. There is Cagney and Keeler dancing in the bar, dancing on a table, Cagney matches. There is what looks like fifty or sixty marched marines, jumping back and forth, rifles thrown and caught. So ... that's true ... a human image of Franklin Roosevelt and NRA Eagle. This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever played Roosevelt, a great federal agency and a host of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment, folks. It is well! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's Prologues get the big deal and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clich√©s that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she seriously stumps out her cranes with her arms flying, which you will help her together. Joan Blondell makes us forget many Hollywood females who may have been more beautiful but who had much less joke and personality. However, the film belongs to Cagney, who grabs and shakes it, and to Berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much.
