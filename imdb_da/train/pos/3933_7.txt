The problem with portraying a real individual is that the performance can be good but still does not work if the audience does not believe the actor portrays the person. That's the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft as Fonda portrayed him. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Licoln ahead. Whether this was a true story, I do not know, but if it is not, then why use Lincoln as the central sign? Never mind. In the film Lincoln defends two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There really isn't much to the movie and as a result it seems to be pretty empty. I wanted more history and character development. The movie is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. There are some small scenes with Lincoln and the thriving relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. The play is good, but, as I said, the performance of the Fonda said as a sign, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just don't think the real Lincoln was so soft. True, he has a big voice when he needs it, as when he persuades a drunk lynch mob to let the accused stand trial, but Fonda portrays Lincoln too badly. However, the other performances are fixed, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a lovely lady that we can really feel for. Simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; We can see why Lincoln would help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think of this movie as an epic, and it was probably at the time of release. But even then there is just not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a good watch, but not a classic.
