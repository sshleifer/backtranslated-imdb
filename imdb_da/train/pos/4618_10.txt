I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could relate. This will be a movie I want to show my kids to let them know the feelings they have are normal. It is fun to see how we could be so confused by things at such a young age. Who knew we would jump back .... again and again .... Great movie !!!!
