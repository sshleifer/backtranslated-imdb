When I get to the "back" of 35, I find myself increasingly shaking my head on the sexy, medical, influenced teens today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as wild for me in my day as it is for teenagers today. This movie drive points home to the core. If you're a late 70's fan, you'll love the movie. From KISS posters to an angel concert this movie rocks! <br /> <br /> Look for a young Laura Dern. Why didn't they have more songs from Runaways, I never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's deflowering character a 16 year old girl. While he was away, she and her friends had a party that destroys the guy's house. Cops come and anything but no mention of all the underage drinks and how these kids got their hands on these things. Foxes are right there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the all-time teen anxiety flicks. <br /> <br /> I say buy it and see it with your kids and talk about it all.
