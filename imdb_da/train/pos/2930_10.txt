The movie has since been cut off, Eddie just seems to bring the unique character to the scene and make it the most basic, fun to have an ice cream as a child to meet the long-standing tradition of the family. The movie is very rare in this country, but unsure of availability in other countries I've searched through a lot of sites and still not successful and succeeded, calling companies searching for rare videos and there are annual waiting lists for it. SO HOME IS VERY WELCOME. If anyone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees that the video gets it, it's worth the money and can't go far wrong.
