** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and have no problem keeping awake for it. It reminds me of 20, unless it's even better. As Veronica says two chickens at a time. It brings out the horn in me, the informal conversation, these two real chickens, rather than hookers, tease us every step of the way. I also get into the conversations. Although they are completely b.s. at times, so what? Every single chicken I have ever spoken to and high on oneself is usually full of the same unreasonably apt, free, self-centered b. philosophy. It's just a lot of nonsense, and about as sensible as the other b. Philosophy chickens are often in: astrological charts. The only deal with this movie is that the guy is almost as feminine as the women he is in the same b. and mood. The brunette chicken is actually the most masculine person there. <br /> <br /> I think it's fun that the brunette chick is so obviously turned on by Veronica. She would love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. She is brilliant. She makes the brunette think that there is something between them, and then she steals the baby boy / man, which is only appropriate, as they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been at the end when she turns her face into her palms, while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing is a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this renunciation. /> <br /> But are they eventually married, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. They are too selfish to be something to each other than stepping stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie though. It kept me entertained, it has a good look and it's sexy.
