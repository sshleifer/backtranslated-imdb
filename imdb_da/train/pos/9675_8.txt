Most people can say that if you were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie, you really have to be bored. In fact, I just got home from being out and turning on the TV and there was "Paulie". <br /> <br /> I had missed the opening credits, so I didn't know the name of it, but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it, so I naturally thought I had voted in "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss it as the sort of flop movie they show late at night. <br /> <br /> Glad to say it was better than that. As you know, if you are not already Paulie lost and are trying to get back to his original owner. Seems it's been years to find her. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways. People come across a literature parrot, and all they see is a way to make money or profit. <br /> <br /> While Cheech Marin's characters are "making money" from him, he is not for him. The dance sequences with the parrots are something children will find sweet, I found them entertaining. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all people are nice people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man lies with him and says he will help him find his owner as long as he helps with his animal communication research. Paulie is now firm, but decides to make a fool out of the man by a demonstration to other Paulie's vocal abilities. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paulie tells his story to the custodian's facilities, ending up freeing him, several other animals, and finding the location of Paulie's owner. It's a touching reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing clipping scene must have been assumed and not shown. That part can interfere with younger children. Otherwise, it's a great movie for older children and adults who are a child of the heart. (END)
