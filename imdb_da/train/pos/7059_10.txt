I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web, I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very sweet and fun sequel to everyone - kids and adults ... just like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find it and very informative film, it shows lessons about being true to yourself and following your heart. I thought it had great animation, and the voice casting was very good; the songs performed by Brooke Allison as well. Since this movie has been divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite of the three, is the story of when the Jaq mouse became a human for a day thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.
