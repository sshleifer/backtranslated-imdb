This was a great movie that had many underlying issues. It dealt with questions of rascism and class. But it also had a message to know yourself and take responsibility for yourself. This movie was very deep, it gave you the message and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being safe with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I think this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. The actors think I was able to convey each figure wonderfully. I just thought it was great how deep this movie really was. By an equally glaring look you would not see how deep the film is, but in the long run you see the underlying meaning of the film.
