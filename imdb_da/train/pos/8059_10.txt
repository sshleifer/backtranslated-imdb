I just watched this movie on Turner Classic Movies last night and was blown away by Victor McLaglen's performance: In every sense of the word a "tour de force". The 1922 atmosphere of Dublin produced through film and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best movies noirs of the 40s and early 50s. Very friendly attention to detail too; Under Frankie McPhillips (Wallace Fords), they mourn in Gaelic. The Max Steiner score is unforgettable. As in later films as the 1939s GWTW, he awarded folk music ballads to borrow local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: Already a 1935 movie giant!
