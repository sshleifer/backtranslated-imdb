One of my favorite movies all the time. I've seen it at least a hundred times, and I can't go through it without crying. I defy anyone to see Celie and Nettie's reunion or Shug and Dad and not feel your eyes become misty. Whoopie Goldberg should have an award for great portrayal. And for the person who said you can't love the movie, if you loved the book, wrong! I'm a will to it.
