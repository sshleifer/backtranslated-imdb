Would it be more romantic comedies that were as well done as this one? I never thought anything like everyday, as the simple sale of a music box could let me catch the weather with excitement. Margaret Sullavan makes a great saleswoman, and she and James Stewart have always brought the best in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgans most winning achievement, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" under his belt that says a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with pleasure. Director Ernst Lubitsch could have believed "Trouble in Paradise" his favorite, but he must certainly consider a triumph. With some of the sharpest dialogues, American films from the 30s have to offer.
