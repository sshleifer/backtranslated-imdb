A very underrated black comedy, the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'coercion') running away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school of wild movie tots, a bunch of hilarious uncountable children attended by horrible stage mothers. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more of a Marion Davies' she tells Winter) leads the clips at their concert and wins a rich father, Weaver. She also makes a nice fun tango and, above all, gives an excellent performance, unlike anything she had done before. The atmosphere is a nice mix of comic and grim. It looks wonderful with great periods (30 years). Lots of lovely swipes in Hollywood and the scary movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he jumps, 'two are but prophetic anyway'. See it and love it.
