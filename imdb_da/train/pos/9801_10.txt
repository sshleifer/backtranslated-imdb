The original animated Dark Knight returns in this essay adventure film that rivals Phantasmask in its coolness. There is much style and intelligence in Batwoman's mystery, so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. There is a new criminal on the street in Gotham. She is dressing like a bat, but she is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman denies any attachment to her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. But Penguin, Bain and the local mob make things more complicated. <br /> <br /> I didn't have big hopes on this' un since it was heavily let down but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn't that much here!), but I was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces, the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor. This is definitely a movie, no fan of Batman should be without. Keep your ears open for a truly captivating song called 'Betcha Neva', which is prominent throughout. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD is not that big. Don't make me wrong, there are some amazing features (the short 'Chase Me' is great) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but the movie is featured in Pan and Scan. Batman: Batwoman's mystery was drawn and shot at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 compared to the widescreen clips displayed on the features where the image is cut off on both sides. I find this extremely annoying consideration Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen. Warner has to literally republish dozens of movies on DVD because people have complained about the lack of Original Aspect Ratio available on some titles. Why they chose to make the same mistake again, is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5. It's a shame because the widescreen would have completed a great DVD package.
