A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of the complaint in relation to the way it relates to paranoia. There is a lot going on in this to have a maturity of only 74 minutes, but it works. The scares are very subtle, not the skipped scares that seem to fill the latest Asian horror films. The way "scares" are set up resembles the disturbing moments in "The Uninvited" (also 4 Inyong Shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but it's almost not the same caliber. The film does a good job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it needs to do. I would recommend checking it out if you get a chance.
