The three Stooges have always been some of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts they have made. I love all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also star many other amazing actors and actresses, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, the three stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and are the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> This is a good Three Stooges card. It's fun and its cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. Stooges performed very well in this brief! I highly recommend this one!
