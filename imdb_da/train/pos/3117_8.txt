I will begin by saying that I am very pleased with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh, please destroy it by making a sequel year from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on.As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it seems he was just meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was delighted to see how well all of the information we get in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' fit into the 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of your seat. The battles between Bourne and the killers are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of movies about CIA agents, and how the CIA gathers their Intel, and this movie is just up the street, making it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without seeing the previous 2 rates .. you will still enjoy the movie, but I still recommend you watch them first. This will allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and be attached and be part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which one is better of the first 2, but personally I think 'ultimatum' might just have the edge when comparing the trilogy.
