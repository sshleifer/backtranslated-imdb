Plotwise this is a pretty silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama / biopic. But the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda really was like at its peak. I was not disappointed - he produces a really warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I never got bored at any time during the movie, so a strong *** 1/2 out of *****
