I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best followers ever, as if not the best of the three Lion King movies! In the film, Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and have trouble fitting in with others, as Timon has trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa travel away from finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also Simba who they are traveling, but soon they have to choose between their dream spot or help Simba meet his evil Uncle Scar and proclaim his right as Prince's King of Pride Rock! Filled with wonderful new characters like Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was spoken by a funney comedian Jerry Stiller's father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to throw Sets into that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation and history and music Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride, though I will admit that I really liked the one too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that the whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!
