So both times twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed watching an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very trustworthy as hunter Alan Quartermaine and consisted of Richard Chamberlain's achievements. I admit that I would have preferred to see another as "Lady in Distress". Alison Doody should adhere to modern and non-period pieces. She did not have the look of the woman from the 19th century. The rest of the throw was fantastic and followed plotlines very well. I am pleased to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be considered older. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide it. A 50+ man can be much sexier (and Patrick is really sexy), so a green youth, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a good smile.
