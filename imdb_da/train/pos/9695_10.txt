Some people may call "Paulie" a children's movie, but I want to argue that it is more than that. Probably more than anything else, this movie goes to great lengths to show the situation of immigrants in the US - currently considering the recent debates. Portraits a parrot telling a Russian immigrant consultant (Tony Shalhoub) how he sought America for his original owners, the film tells several stories. There is the older woman (Gena Rowlands) to whom he turns, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. All in all, it is a very well made movie. I don't normally expect much of these kind of movies, but this is a treat. I highly recommend it. Also with Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
