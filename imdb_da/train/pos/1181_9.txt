Rachel Griffiths writes and leads this award-winning short film. A heartbreaking story of coping with grief and shining memory of those we have loved and lost. Although Griffiths only 15 minutes long can capture as much feeling and truth in movies in no time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance like Will, a widower who struggles to cope with the death of his wife. Will be confronted with the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he continues to take care of the Rut's pet queue, Tulip. The film shows grief and responsibility you feel for those they have loved and lost. Good movie, great direction and excellent act. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived.
