This movie is great, you never have to wait for a stomach to laugh for more than a minute and there is much more to it than the original premise for the movie. Everywhere there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming adversity genre of which these parodies. Don't let anyone tell you they are trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities; - Sure, there's plenty of it, but it's all coherent and not free. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best movie I've seen this year.
