This movie was extremely fun, I want to own this for my vintage collection of the 1970s movies to see again the list, I know this cast of characters, they are people I've met over the years and it asks me to investigate This comedy, unfortunately, was never set to DVD or VHS. Rescue Foxx always a comedy law, Pearl Baily a big fight as his wife witty and sassy, ​​Norman a son with a secret, not sure if he wants a future, if it is out, Dennis Dugan, crazy fun man. Miss Dobson hooks with a heart and a little conscience. Love, desire, strange family ties, this movie qualifies for an upcoming back-performance, comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake, I think finding cast would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan's role, this earns a few Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman's that you, keeping them closest was quite impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and adultery of a parent. This movie was a wild ride advice of a cabbie, reminding me of episode Kramer taking advice from his caddy over his lawyer. (episode from Seinfeld) Parents have there jaw dropping moment, fun over fun That screams brings me back.
