This is, of course, aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but is different in its lesser cartoon-like feel (despite the deliberately drawn characteristics of the leading creatures). The story is not one that has massive in your face morally at the end (it's more like dragging on your shirt sleeves), but just choosing to tell a story about relationships between different "animals". You know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn. The people themselves are far more than their voices (the benefit of lesser-known actors making the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely credible, odd. The group dynamics are excellently presented, and the sign revelations and quirks are subtle and pleasant. You will find yourself rooting for them much faster than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant as you would expect and you will ask for the opportunity to go on ice slides in movies. You fall in love with the characters, especially the prehistoric squirrel's comic relief and its desperate attempt to bury its nuts. I came out who wanted the mandatory goods, especially the Lithuanian toys, to only be disappointed the next day, as I couldn't find any guard connected. <br /> <br /> What weird is making the movie more clean. <br /> <br /> Better than Monster's Inc or Shrek.
