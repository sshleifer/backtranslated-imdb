May 2004, Wonderland is new in the UK. Brilliant film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80s, you will appreciate how well it is caught. The use of the elements that make up its gritty film style is original, enhances the experience and brings the viewer very close to being there. The use of an unsolicited 'Pulp Fiction' style timeline allows you to explore the uncertainty of what really happened while the direction and notion of the cast command is attentive, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar surely if I handed them over.
