"All flags" are each the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements that the fairytale fan could hope for, and more because in this is the judge in need, not really in need. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her athletic best and runs her enemies through in violation of the social norms of the period. Anthony Quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and turns out to be a wild and easy nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic fairy tale fan, "Against All Flags" is a must-see. Although it may not be in the same league as some of Errol Flyn's previous work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it is still a very entertaining drum.
