but just as entertaining and random! Love it or hate it, but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail-changing cliffhanger. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without follow-up and repeat performances of crazy characters (yes ... so far, I have a feeling that I will develop favorites as the season continues). "Creature Comforts" are not too weak humor - it is supposed to be enjoyed with the slightest work in your brain. Therefore, this show shows everything I need in a program when I come home from work in the evening: superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of "sweet" to the characters I can enjoy when I finally see up from computer to see what I'm missing. <br/> <br /> Funnier than most of today's sitcoms, more quiet than an evening at NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and comebacks. Can't wait for the next one.
