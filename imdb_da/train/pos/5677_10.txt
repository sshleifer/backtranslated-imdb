The 3rd and in my opinion the best of the Blackadder series. The only drawback is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character from the previous series, but Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is the appropriate madcap laugh a line. <br /> <br /> As a package, it's quality through and through with convincing rain sets, super cut sarcasm and tiny bites, the 'macbeth' actors stand out and Prince Georges 'lucky us' chicken impressions and the missing words from dr. johnsons dictionary. few comedies have been right as both wise, as they are funny, okay the odd lame observation or line comes in, but mostly it is a scream.
