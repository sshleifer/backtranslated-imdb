I first saw this movie as a pre-teenager, about the age at which children begin to think through their identity. I was severely affected by the human scene and the children he travels as his own. The oldest boy has been told that his mother is a prostitute, and none of his siblings have the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes clear about having children who do not see each other out). The man still persuades the guy that he is their father by the only definition that counts. The man is called the father of all the children, but the one who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the vignettes is also convincing for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even though it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
