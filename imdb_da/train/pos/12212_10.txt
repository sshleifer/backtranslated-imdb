What is so taboo about love?! People seem to have major problems with transgenic. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie didn't see me. It was a grainy shot approx. 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing. I couldn't believe how freaking amazing this movie was. It touches so many levels of human feeling that it did not even fail to move in one way or another. It's by far the best independent movie I've ever seen. I did not consider these signs as either sex, just human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Law for all fearless filmmakers!
