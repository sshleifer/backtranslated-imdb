This could be WWE's 2nd best PPV of the year after Wrestlemania it was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent match in which he disturbed Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy kept his IC title in a short blurred match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a rather violent table battle over Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good game with Kidman, which was surprising to me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a no dq match, at one time Booker T kicked the scissors to the Big Show and sent him straight through the table. In a silly decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, they defeated the jealous anti-Americans Hogan and Edge with great help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the fight at night, it was filled with big high spots, and RVD got to keep his ic title through a DQ so I was glad he kept the title. Triple H is also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little to nothing. And in the main, Rock became the first worldwide WWE world champion to defeat both Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple threat battle. Overall, this is probably WWE's second best PPV of 2002! 10.7
