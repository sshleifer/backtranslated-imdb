This is a haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice, directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that it in every way transcends the source material to become something more violent and more original (interesting Camus also circles Cain's novel as a key inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger). The film has greater power and intensity than the novel, because Visconti is able to create the cinematic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex gender exploration. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated with white architecture (the main character Cora is doubtful afraid she will be identified as a Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context, that Visconti is working in. This allows the class opposites to take a central stage and dance among the passionate, doomed love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complex, exciting, rewarding experience.
