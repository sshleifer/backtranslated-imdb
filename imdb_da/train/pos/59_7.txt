While I was the video store, I searched through the $ 1 rentals and came across this little gem. I don't know what it was about, but I just had a gut clinic about it and wow I was right. The story is centered around two girls who have just survived a school recording. One of the girls is Alicia a teenage reble, the only witness to the full attack, and another is Deanna, another survivor who survived a bullet in the head of a miracle. Collapsed by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and beyond. <br /> <br /> I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow, what an appearance of Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD lacked much in features. Oh, and some of the cuts in the movie were kind of disgrace. But all in all, an excellent movie.
