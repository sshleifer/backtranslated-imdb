I agree with what "veinbreaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling you get at the end of this movie. I absolutely loved the places they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic soundtrack that Hans Matheson sings on. It's trippy. Nighy was fab in his role, Nail "nailed" it, Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea held it together. Bruce Robinson was wonderful. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt Juliet Aubrey's performance was beautiful. The scenes between Aubrey & Robinson killed me! The perfect game and the music behind the scene was spot on! Too bad not many more musicians have checked out this movie! They should! I've told all my musical friends. great quote from Jimmy Nails character: "It must be rock & roll, not Phantom of the f ***** g opera!"
