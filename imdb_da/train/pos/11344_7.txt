Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this at the cinema for 4 years, and I have very happy and vibrant, reminiscent of it. Seeing this as an adult allows one to capture the references far above the audience's head - just like the piece where Jimmy's gray witch pary is ripped and Witch Hazel (Cass) cheats "I knew she had brown roots!". Of course, it is strongly influenced by the floral power of time and in some ways quite progressive. The Different track, for example, sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running the package and appreciating what is about yourself which is different. This can be a hymn to gay communities, it should be a good track. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all good as witches, and the Living Island cast gives it their all in limiting their character suits (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There are a lot of overreacting acts in this movie - there is really nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to worry about the kidnapped residents on Living Island, it's really a little more than shouting. This is drama and comedy spread out with a trowel. Even though I think about it - I could never stand the whistle myself. I love the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned Various, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild's touch if I could. In addition, it is now on CD from the tasteful people at El Records in London. See here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
