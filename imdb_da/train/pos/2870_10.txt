This movie is wonderful. It has always been will always be. I really mean what's better when a maid falls in love. Walt really made him here. And the music! A dream is a wish your heart does is beautiful! What more can you say beyond fantastic! I can't wait until the special edition comes out, it gets so amazing! I can't wait to hear all the deleted songs! This movie is made so beautiful and smart! It's great. What about the sweet mice too! I know I say the same thing over and over and over, but hey it's a good movie! Woods was amazing in this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
