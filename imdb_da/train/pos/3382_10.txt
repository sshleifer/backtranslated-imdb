I have not often had the feeling of a movie, it could be visionary. But it is clear that this film has the seed of a premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not be inclined to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions at the moment. But didn't we say this by "1984"? Had James Orwell known that the internet became reality not long after 1984; In fact, it was in 1994; He could have rethought writing his story as he did. Inspection is rewarded. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter. What matters is that we often consider ourselves superior to our surroundings, but actually become emotional about a "love apple" when necessity knocks at our door. A snapshot of ourselves in old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the timeline will show to us, I know for a fact that we have not yet seen the start of it. <br /> <br />
