Here is my first David Mamet-directed movie. Assembly as it was his first, as well. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven, and it moves like any movie, from the small drawbacks to the major drawbacks to the all-encompassing cow. It's like "The Grifters" but without the film's level. (In that movie, John Cusack was black, but that was the character of his character.) The action here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the intense play of Crouse was a kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it develops after painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - as she reads them - are as if they are inner monologues or narratives that they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna, things are picked up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I expect crackerjack-ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these do not. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet developed this movie and released it, but if not, he might have to let others guide his words. He is too valuable to them here, and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What is more strange is that other than this, the movie does not look or feels like a game. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked too much like filmed theater, but in this movie the actors were not only achieved but relaxed and free. Everything went out. <br /> <br /> I didn't mind it so much if it sounded like movie characters that spoke movie lines - or even playing characters that speak playing lines - but here it sounds like movies (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's a weird jumble of theater and movies that just don't work. It does not mean that the film is bad - it is not, it is often extremely entertaining. The best piece is in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive game. She will help him with his gambling debt so she enters the House of Games, a spawning game room, where men work in a back room. I admit the setup is pretty unlikely. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting her to write a check? Was Billy in on it? One of those questions is clearly answered at the end.) And from here, the downsides are starting to roll out . I found the first - the small teachers - to be the most fun. We get a lesson in the concert's art as much as Crouse is. <br /> <br /> We see the end coming, and so we didn't see the other end coming, and the real ending I didn't see, but maybe you did. The ball just keeps jumping back and forth and at the last scene in the movie we realize that the other Crouse entered the House of Games, she found her true call. I have to forgive the annoying opening, the unlikely bits and the weird line reading, because there are many good things here. If the first part of the film is stagy, hold it tight. After the half hour mark, it gets really fast. If you want a fun movie then she's here. If you want Mamet, see "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley made him better. <br /> <br /> ***
