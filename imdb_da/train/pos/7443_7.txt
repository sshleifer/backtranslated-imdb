An old saying says "If you think you're having trouble, visit a hospital." It has been updated in recent years to "If you think you're having trouble, then watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer's!" This movie is one of those so bad, it's good! That's why I gave it a seven-it's okay, but not good. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just as the daily talk show is advertised as "an hour in your life, you never get back!" All the well-known themes are here ... incredible husbands / lovers, the wildest audience on television, women flashing Jerry, etc. The shocker looked at Molly Hagan, who usually plays cute characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") plays a trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as their equally sweet daughter who performs sexual favors for virtually all people with whom they came in contact. The men (including the staff producer) were presented as the quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got. I don't want to spoil or reveal everything, but the movie plays like the daily show. Here in Phoenix, it is shown back in the back for two hours every morning, and after that, everything else seems to be pale. Again I give this movie a seven ... it's good, but not good. Jerry Springer is best taken in small one-hour doses.
