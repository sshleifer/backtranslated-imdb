"The intruder (L'Intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays "Louis Trebor" as Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past who just lives in an isolated cabin in the woods for just paranoid reasons (but attracts pretty young women that might be useful to him). We learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that can unfold chronologically or not, as well as through his brusque interactions with family, lovers, business associates and a striking nemesis. Like "The Limey", the film resonates with parents and children and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old movie with the same actor as a young man (here Paul Gégauff's 1965 adventure film "Le Reflux"). <br /> <br /> In a complete contrast of moods, we meet his son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who will be the sexiest housekeeper in the world as he sweetly and seductively repairs the household and cares for a baby, a young child, and everybody need for his working wife. Certain director / co-author Claire Denis must have created him as a woman's imagination, if ever there was one and one lesson for other filmmakers about filming. There is an extra extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while gently carrying his English baby in a bag. He is all that his father is not and has every relationship that his father is unable to sustain; No wonder he thinks his father is "lunatic". I spent the rest of the movie in fear that something bad would happen to him, as the true nature of his alien father was very progressively out of sight. <br /> <br /> The movie is a puzzle, but Subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we see him traverse countries and negotiate harmless deals, and the voice-over story for Denis' Beau Travail "was annoying anyway. Calculating from skylines and random signage that he travels to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific, timing is indicated by the seasons that change and scars are created and healing. There are plenty of pictures of water for cleaning and removal. /> <br /> Continues her fascination with the morph of colonialism in globalization and plays a bit on the stereotypes of Mysterious Orient and Russian criminals Denis has incorporated elements from Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando's Tahiti idols and a 40-page memoir of French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the last to the title and the heart transplant plot used for an ironic theme with limited immortality, which has consequences. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" means a t he succeeds in being over limits, rules and morals, there is some entertainment in the last act as the locals do not really know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even if he is again in isolation. <br /> <br /> More people in the audience were frustrated by the elliptical but strikingly beautiful storytelling method. The unconventional tale raises many things about details.
