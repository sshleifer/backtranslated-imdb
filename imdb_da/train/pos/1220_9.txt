Origin of Care Bears & their cousins. If you saw the original movie, you will see a discrepancy. The cousins ​​have traveled with Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. But I have no problems with it, and prefer to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are cute and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a lovely threatening shapeshifter. I could empathize with the three children, as I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are cute and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toy or enjoyed the original, do not miss it. 9.10
