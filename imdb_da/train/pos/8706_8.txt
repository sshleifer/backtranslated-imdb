What happens when the average Joe finds out that he has supernatural powers? The premise may sound familiar. Guards Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi action girl, The Sword Bearer, is far from the standard stock. The story is about a man named Sasha who, as a boy, was cut off from society, his peers and family because of a supernatural power that he possesses. When he wants or gives his anger, a sword stretches from his arm piercing his own skin. Very wolverinish? Maybe ... but that's not the interesting part of this movie. Shunned all his life and driven by anger (and a temper he has) our "hero" returns to his hometown to turn his life around or find a reason. All he meets here is trouble when a meeting with an old flame's new girlfriend leaves him blood on the ground. This is where revenge and anger come into play. This is a man you do not want to cross, and from this point is the mafia and the police on its tail. He meets a girl and falls in love immediately, like she and this is really what the film is about. <br /> <br /> The movie is very impressionist with bold colors and noir overtones spliced ​​with short but extreme action sequences. This is the art house in its core, beautifully filmed with such attention to detail in every scene of cruel sci-fi action. It is this strange moss that interests me so much in this movie. The director's approach to this genre is refreshing with a focus on Sasha's emotional journey and not a pretty action movie. Don't worry, the action is there and lots of it. However, many of these sequences show only implicit violence with images of the terrible indentation. This is not to say that action is not displayed. These scenes are here and are amazing (especially the end where we see Sasha's powers released in desperation). The director chooses to assume the violence in many scenes to focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand. This is a tragic love story and a refreshing recording of the genre.
