Cinderella was one of the first movies I've ever seen, and for me it's timeless. It's a nice looking movie, with beautiful animation. My favorite animation scene was the dress stage - I just love those mice. The songs are also lovely, not as good as Snow White's, but they are a joy to sing and remind of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a wish, and then it is love? are standouts. The characters are also a pleasure. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice gave great comic relief. The trailmen were also well-finished, as well as Lucifer. But I loved the pin best, she was really evil, compared to a great character in the name of Fairy Godmother. It's true the movie pulls a bit, with the mouse's attacks, but they were really funny, so I don't care. I don't think it's overvalued, undervalued, don't you think? It rarely plays on television, but the right dead sequel happens regularly on Cinemagic. If you want a good Cinderella fit, try the wonderful Ever After, or the sumptuous Slipper and Rose that are not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel that I'm wrong to own because you want to thank me. 10.9. Bethany Cox
