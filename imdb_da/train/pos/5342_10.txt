I was deeply moved by this film in many respects. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most valuable little thing! Such a beautiful little girl. Her plays were also fantastic. True to life and very human. Although I do not like the part where she had to smoke I hope it was just a false prop. In some way she was absolutely wonderful, and the story was so moving. I found myself immersed in the story and her character. <br /> <br /> It's quite interesting how I came to discover this movie actually. I went in crevices and I just happened to notice her beautiful smile on the cover as I walked by. Luckily I looked down the line that this movie was in! I thought to myself, 'Awes, look at her!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as "A Little Gem". I read the plot on the back and then thought it, yes, maybe I will first see it on IMDb and then come back and rent it at a later time. I'm glad I didn't, because I'd definitely missed it. After searching for a movie with my friend I knew I would end up regretting not renting this movie so I went back to the place where I originally found it and pitched it. <br /> <br /> It had been on my dresser for a week since school started for me this week and I really didn't have time to see it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. I popped it in and was glued to the beautiful movie, nice score and moving plot from start to finish. I was so imprisoned and have to say that some parts almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to mention the young boy in this movie, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was remarkable. Also the actor who played Carol's father, whose name is unfortunately not listed on the website. His voice was so loving and gentle that I could really feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is truly a wonderful movie. If you are a person of light, but emotional, then this is definitely one for you.
