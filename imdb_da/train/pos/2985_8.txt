The whole point of making this movie, one of the earliest and best international color releases of movie opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded with admiration. The general public will not sit still for a love story of two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if they are played by the typical 300 pounds over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Therefore, the beautiful substitution visual substitution (a young Loren, beautiful Della Marra and a slimy Maxwell) that makes history much more credible and gives those who are not familiar with the plot or music a better chance of being wooed in lovely arias who might not otherwise be. All in all, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's amazing works. I remember seeing this when I was in high school, and it certainly woke my interest in opera, a form that I was not so familiar with. I still enjoy this movie with pleasure and would recommend it a lot to those who might appreciate the amazing music accompanied by better than transparent images. Luciano Della Marra was a standout like Radames, and unfortunately for the audience not appear in other movies.
