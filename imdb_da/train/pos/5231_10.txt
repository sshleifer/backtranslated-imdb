to communicate in the movie's important things in life - just like what is life, does it matter? - is completely impossible. Of course, there may be possible answers to these questions in each movie (story), but communication requires a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the input from the senses overrules "input" from our mind, ie. our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate important things. Tarkovsky is one. His "Stalker" shows pictures of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing the same.
