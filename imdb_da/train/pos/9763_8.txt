Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in the theaters. My father took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, Dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we will see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theater to see it again - at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite scary for a five year old. The scene of the huge sea of ​​candy and the hypnotic camel scene .. I can't remember much of this movie. Of course, the beginning was magical and a few scenes - I wish I could find it again and will probably search it now. <br /> <br /> I remember beloved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
