An unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches Streep line for line and take to take - it is one of the best showcases yet of his wonderful acting talent and he is at his sexy and beautiful best, regardless of the intensity of his role. This thrilling movie is a treat for any movie fan who loves a poignant courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unentimental terms. The movie - which won several top awards in Australia - boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic Australian sites. It shows that people are the same worldwide. And after all these years, people still enjoy repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo ate moy baby!" Including the imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld."
