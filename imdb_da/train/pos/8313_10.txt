First of all, I think the comment below is unworthy of a site like this. Of course, you have no taste and you do not respect the tastes of others. Not giving you a history lesson, but I think it should be done. Black actors out there are just, if not more, successful as others. If you're not part of the "Black" race, you can't understand the quality, creativity and living of old movies like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High." As you are unfortunately not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we look at these classics, so you have to keep your freaking mouth closed and just stick to your non-dancing race. Thanks.
