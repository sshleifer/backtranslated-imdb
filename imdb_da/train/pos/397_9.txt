I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong movie presence. A Chinese fantasy image cannot be easily presented to an audience, and the director tried to bring Zu Mountain's classic fantasy stories back, and that is what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu has really improved from one in 1983. From this new millennium update we could see Tsui Hark's view of the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs, amazing action-fantasy epics beautifully made. Hold me glued through the whole picture. Big cast with just fine actors. It's really a funny movie to watch, but is it too strange? <br /> <br /> Now, people are confused with their broad storyline shortened in a 95 minute movie. Plot may not have much relation between characters, but by revising the movie you get a better understanding of the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not too much physical struggle, in addition to characters who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, spirits struggling with the hand would not have any meaning at all. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this great stylish image. It may have a thin story, but hey look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", we were also confused by the plot, but it was really stylish and amazing. Tsui Hark always attracts something else in H.K. Movie theater. American audiences may have difficulty understanding while watching this movie because this is no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but special effects are really better than Storm Riders. This is really worth checking out.
