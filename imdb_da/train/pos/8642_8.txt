A surprisingly effective thriller, this. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and in a compromise deal Mulder accepts on the go, provided they visit places of historical interest on famous serial killers along the way. His idea: he writes the words she takes the pictures, with the end result a best-selling coffee table that sets them up for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to share and advertise the facts. When their mishaps would have it, Brad Pitt sees the advertisement and he and his girlfriend Juliette Lewis meet the author couple and shortly after killing his landlord and begin their cross country trek. Pitt is indispensable as the true chill inspiring Early Greyce and is capable of being backed by Lewis playing his usual white trash that seems to be her default setting. Duchovny and Forbes also make a convincing double action, and as the events sprout out of control, you as the viewer are sucked into their situation and can feel the tension. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, scary and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond the current status. A top film.
