I watched this movie in the video store a couple of years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought VHS and have had it ever since. <br /> <br /> The reason has been discussed so there is no need to go over it again. The point is that this movie deserves repeated views. The Americans in particular will not get all the jokes the first time. I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray suggests the dish at her daughter's wedding, it is cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" as he tries to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally the corner of the woman in black, it's too fun for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: It's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard this year. I danced in the living room to "All over the world." <br /> <br /> Every performance is perfect. Bill Nighy has been fairly complimented for his depiction of Ray, a man who has had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the gracious keyboard player who has carried a flashlight to Karen all those years. He has an appealing pendant look that makes women hug him. But all the actors are just as brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore any pans you read about this movie and watch it. It's a gem.
