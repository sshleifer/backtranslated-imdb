"The movie aimed at adults" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does well and is still a better than average movie that ages very well. Though it is comical moments aiming lower than the rest of it, the film has a wonderful specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) who are not used to shortchange the characters or viewers. (That is, Mobsters never appear in complications. It will never be grotesque as my Big Fat Greek Wedding). The secondary stories lines are told with short scenes that allow for a break from the big thread. These are the scenes that are now lacking in modern films, where their immediate value cannot be impressed by producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also includes beautifully older characters. The film takes its own small, quiet way to a conclusion. There is not a badly written scene included anywhere to get some leaders sphincter relax. Cage and Cher do very good work. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck invokes old school, ethnic, workaday New York much like 'Marty' except Moonstruck is far less sanctimonious.
