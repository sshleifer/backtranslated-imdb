Initially, I didn't even know about this show since a year because of the internet. I haven't even seen it on TV before in my country, and many people don't usually know about this show. However, it's a shame because this is the most original and clever animation I've seen this year. I don't award 10 points a lot, but it's a show that really deserves a total of 10 points. Although at first glance, it may seem like a typical cartoon, but keep in mind that this is not a children's show. As the whole story unfolds, you know this is a really deep story, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on breath, an ancient Indian belief that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show an original twist that you don't often find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also very different. At times, it looks a bit like gritty designs, and sometimes it takes a more comic-like approach. I think David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment of the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic). If you're looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on different topics like reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then it's something you shouldn't miss out on. When you start to see, you will probably see it to the end. A minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but it's not too annoying. However, the only question is where is the DVD?
