The star of this movie is the manuscript. Attention to detail during the period in dress, language, social mores (we do not hurt women) and the policy is remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo today. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer, and the choreography of these action sequences is amazing. Perhaps this film is close to reality to serve the support it should have received. It is like a staircase of rising violence with a successful break of peace and quiet between each step. A good movie ....
