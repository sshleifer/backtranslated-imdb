This movie scared me out of me when I was just a kid. It's not "Citizen Kane", but it has its moments. Arm ripping scene is good. The reason is good, though characters are not - could have something to do with the actor. Put some top names in the roles and then see what you get. This was one of those shooters, edit (how small there was) and distribute in a few months the type of movie. This is classic low budget sci-fi and merely deserves it. I rated it a 9 based other movie of this genre and age.
