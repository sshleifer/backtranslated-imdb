There's something about every "Hammer" movie, I see what really brings me into a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies everything can happen. "Guard of the Abyss" is one of those types of movies. It experiences deep into the occult and the hypnosis to bring another form of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
