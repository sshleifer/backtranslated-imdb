"Everything in the world is a stage and its people actors in it" - or something. Who in the hell said that theater stopped at orchestral pits - or even in the theater door? Why isn't the audience the participants in the theater experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great experiment that said, "Hi! The story is you, and it needs more than your attention it needs for your active participation". "Sometimes we bring the story to you, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> No one's listened, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been said.
