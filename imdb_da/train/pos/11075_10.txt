After reading the reviews for this movie, I understandably began to see it with great doubt that it would actually be good. But this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Most reviews I had read said the complicated plot made it difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the band ends up as many loose ends as you want to kick yourself because you've missed so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", in the sense that it's not so much fun (actually it's pretty dark), and it's much more intelligent in the way you see parts of scenes from different views (and in one of the best scenes in the movie, Jason Statham uses five minutes in an elevator that has an argument with himself). The way it looks like the two movies I just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters, especially Statham, which gives a great performance as the driver, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedos, but gives a good performance anyway. If you have the time and time to think about the movie, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbols and hints that have been posted through the movie. I think it's great and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.
