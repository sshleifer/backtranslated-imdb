Later one night on a deserted road, Martin Sheen spins in an empty salon a yarn for Robert Carradine from Hopalong Cassidy and friends who trace a group of murderous cattle breeders who have killed some men and kidnapped Cassidy's girl. <br /> Author / Director Christopher Coppola May Have Held the William Boyd Purist's Wrath by Daring to Make a Modern Low Budget Movie with Their Beloved Hoppy, But I'm glad he did! No sign should be so tied to an actor that no one is ever allowed to play him or her again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and an interesting update to the classic programmers in their thirties and forties. Although he is guilty of some bad plays, this is serious enough and unpretentious, which makes it hard for me to dislike. <br /> <br /> However, the whole production is a bit strange, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we look at a story in a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more tasty.
