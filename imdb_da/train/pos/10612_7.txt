It's cheesy, it's scary, it's brutal, but it makes it so much fun. It has come across the top melodramatic moments that are just ridiculous. This movie is great to make fun of. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The movie centers around three female news editors in a timely manner before mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get room to stay at night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He is crazy in a psychological way. And he offers to leave them at home with him. But he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as amazing as "The Unseen" that he really carries this movie. Most of the film is a bit boring, although it is interesting to find out the truth in Ernest's family. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this roll in these scenes makes it worth seeing. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make beautiful eye candy. <br /> <br /> I see the movie an old gem, hard to find and worth seeing.
