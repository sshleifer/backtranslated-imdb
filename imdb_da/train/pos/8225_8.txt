Oddly enough, all the previous comments just described the beginning and left the details over. I have to confirm that this is a family job when Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein's wife, and the excellent jazz music was written by the tea director's father Andr√©. Under these circumstances, it was no wonder that it was a really good thriller, as it was issued and immediately identified with the music. The excitement was flawless and maintained all the time to the end. Robert Hossein, then one of the best European players, managed to impose himself as a topscreen and stage director. He still shows major stage shows, with a preference for religious issues. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
