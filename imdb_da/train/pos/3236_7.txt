Half a dozen short stories of varying interest inform us about life in Finland. These stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sound wave is heard. This indicates that the depicted events occur simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a bungy jump that promises some excitement, but the early stories are pretty low keys. The film improves, so hold it. Two broken marriages in subsequent stories give lots of drama, while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient who begs for pain relief. The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving. <br /> <br /> While the various family life scenes take place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature, no matter where you live. <br /> <br /> Collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a well-tense 90-minute drama.
