Thomas Ince has always had the ability to bring simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair. "The Italian" is such a movie. Massive plays, especially by George Beban, father of silent actress George Beban, Jr., and wonderful sets set a realistic sense of early immigrant settlements in New York. These give this 1915 film a authenticity that is unusual in a row by this vintage. The film begins with a modern and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reading a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we go into the story with George who plays the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his fiance from Italy to America, marries her and has a son with her. But times are tough and the family is struggling to survive. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her child and avoid the complications of the dirty formula, but also, even the early Dream Factory shot politically correct behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime commander who inadvertently puts him in prison, and at the last minute he decides on his planned action. Very nice. I loved the curtain effect, it was fantastic. Wonderful use of lighting in this movie. <br /> <br /> I give "The Italian" an 8 out of 10.
