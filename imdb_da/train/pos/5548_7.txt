Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with his two favorite comrades and assistant Clarence Brown are editing - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish islanders - the same area that Michael Powell would earn 20 years later for his first major success. Visions of wind and wave, sun-shining silhouettes of lovers not only complement the story, they are the story of struggle against adversity. The actors bring the dignity of pride to their roles, and Pickford is brilliant as her character struggle with her duties as clan manager, waving between comedy and thoughtful, here with her father's villain who swaying colorful islanders in the church, sat there with his guest stick in his hand as a scepter and discussed his lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble. I tried but failed.
