I think this movie has much to recommend it, especially a particularly creepy performance by David Morse and a more than acceptable performance of it always worth seeing. Foxx. Although there are many gaps in the plot and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, all of it gives a good time in front of the tube.
