This was an excellent 2-part episode, although I had never seen the elderly, I never thought the doctor would go up to something paranormal, extra terrestrial of course, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things we fear most, and how would we, in a futuristic time, fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say it would be impossible. Being that it is a family movie I am surprised that they brought in some things like fear and faith, especially if it will also entertain American audiences. But who cares what Yanks says we rock! Doctor Who has shown potential since episode 1 of the new series in 2005, first to be so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to dark. I hope many old fans will someday soon say "The old doctor who has returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
