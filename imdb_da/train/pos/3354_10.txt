This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this movie so many times, and I find it myself current these days (2003) when Italy again suffers from some kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the US for that matter). I'm glad there are excluded like the one played by Mastroianni in this movie that can sing out of tune; Perhaps they can teach Sophia Lorens in this world to be strong and struggle to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: As most people mentioned here, the play is wonderful, but the sound background is amazing. I must assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the expulsion of machism, the distortion of reality in the ever-present radio chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome really can make you shake! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
