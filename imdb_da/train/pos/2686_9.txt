La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spain movie. Everything that happens in this movie has a symbolic meaning. It is quite different from the usual movie you have access to. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but it will only be good for the people who want to look for the meaning of everything in the film's history. I have to advise that this is not a test movie. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy !!!
