Before I begin, let me tell you how great this stand-up special sounds when playing Sonic Adventure in DX: Director's Cut at the same time (especially the Red Mountain level). So while watching this stand-up special, I suggest - no, you do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes his stand-up to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There he makes fun of everyone with absolutely no excuses. I thank God very much here that Carlos did not do his thing, using the same joke again and again and again and again and again and again and again. He does a tremendous job making fun for everyone while being truthful about it; I know a few times, I said, after Carlos said a joke: "Damn, this guy makes a good point!" And then came the Game Over screen over my TV because I forgot I played Sonic Adventure in DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this stand-up special. If you have TiVo or something, do yourself a favor and record this historic hour.
