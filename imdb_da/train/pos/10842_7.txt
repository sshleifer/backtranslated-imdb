So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy in the video store, he said it sounded like Still Crazy. So I rented it. I was disappointed Now, when Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but that's okay. Still Crazy tells the story of The Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s on top of their popularity at a major rock festival. Twenty years later, band members struggle to live, and they get the opportunity to play a concert at this year's festival. They take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis and tour Europe in the process. Some quite funny haninks follow and all the characters go through subtle changes. If you see this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And it's not bad at all.
