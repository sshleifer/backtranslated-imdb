Soldier must not have academy or Lucas special effects, but it certainly does. I don't want to tell you what it's all about, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a great doomed futureistic action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell doesn't say much, he usually has a creepy or drone look on his face, but it fits the character. There are good action and fighting scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but it is Hollywood that makes faith in earth that we must escape our normal lives. I haven't seen Soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. I am fortunate enough to have a wife digging on lighthouses; We both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guys / sci-fi movies.
