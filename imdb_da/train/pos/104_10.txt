This movie had an interesting cast, the math did not have a list cast, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have b grade movies like this, the story is basic, the actors are basic, and that's the way they do it. You don't need a million dollar budget to make a movie just a mix of b-list ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like the way they had the street on themselves and that there were no others around, and what I myself was interesting was that they did not close a caf√© to put that equipment and that they did it all from a police station . Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen did a good job of portraying roles in the hostage situation. This was a great movie and I hope to see more like it in the near future.
