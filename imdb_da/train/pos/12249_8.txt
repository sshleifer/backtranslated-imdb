Old Jane's mannered story seems very popular these days. I've lost the number of versions that go around. Probably the reason for this is that her "ruts" are our "ruts" even at this late date. This TV mini series gives it a way of telling the novel. Headstrong, meaningful Emma is a beautiful "modern" girl when you think about it, although the atmosphere of Jane Austen's world may seem a bit artificial to us today. If you don't feel like EMMA, I'll just say that self-sufficient Emma gets her comeuppance. It is worth looking to find out how. The actress here goes to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have had a mental connection to old Jane!
