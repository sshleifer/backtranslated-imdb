I'm totally shocked that this show had been canceled. Nothing lasted just one year. I just recently started to see it and I love it. It's a show that could have gone as far as Friends went. It had humor and was extremely comfortable. <br /> <br /> There are about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under a roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays that part of the oldest sibling and takes the more dangerous role. <br /> <br /> This was going to be much more than the year it was great. Great show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
