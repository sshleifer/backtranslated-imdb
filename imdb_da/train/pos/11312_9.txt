Ossession is in very poor condition, but is now undergoing a full restoration at Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a "Master Positive" 2nd generation originally from the printed Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It has been scanned at Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and then processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software. Then the rest is manual labor, and we do not expect finishing before the early spring. Sometimes next year, it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that the restoration efforts will be enjoyed by many future generations.
