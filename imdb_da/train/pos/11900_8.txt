Both visually and musically stunning. A treatment for both the eye and the ear. The distinctive Victorian element of the opening sequences was absolutely enchanting and helped create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would have rightly prided himself on. Technically, the production is visually stimulating, and the special effects are imaginatively designed and creatively obtained in a traditional stage setting. Dance of many of the leading artists is breathtakingly good. The photography and lighting are first class, and the sound recording fits the overall high level of technical skills. A great movie for the whole family during Christmas time and a most beautiful discovery that resists more images.
