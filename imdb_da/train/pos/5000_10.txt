Creature Comforts in America should have been released on another network, or at least given the chance to get the full outcome of episodes. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Considering that American audiences (apparently) have the attention of a mouth when it comes to humor that does not consist of mocking laced diatribes or is concerned with scatological functions (both sound and odor), it turns out this will be few and far between. One of the main problems, however, was that it was brilliant, it was made for a rare audience who knew what to expect, but was seen by an audience and desk who had no idea what they were looking at. It is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three seasons of this show, even though it was produced for direct DVD publishing. The material and interplay between the creatures was rich in sub-context, and there were other conversations that were just waiting to be held beneath the surface. But thanks to political correction, such conversations only take place in my mind.
