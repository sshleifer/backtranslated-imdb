This is great - the play wonderful, set, clothes, music - but most of all the story itself. I am surprised that there are no more reviews of this movie - certainly one of the best of the 1980s. It's also a wonderful movie to watch along with the great "Random Harvest", which has much the same opening crisis <br /> - a middle-aged, unknown English WWI Officer is in a hospital at the end of the war, suffering from chess shock and complete memory without any clue about his name, origin or anywhere he belongs - he turns out to be a very well-established man - when he "restores" will not remember the years before the war - <br /> <br / > But the similarities of the film end. <br /> <br /> My warmest thanks to everyone who participated in the movie - especially the actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a great and surprising casting choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This will stay with you forever.
