Three scumbags get their bare deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; This style of film always makes me wonder where the reality goes and the imagination takes over. Although these people were the earth's foam, I found myself sinful. They never really got much of a chance.
