I grew up on this movie and I remember when my brother and I used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years have passed, I watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. If you are a parent and you have not seen this movie with your children, just keep them in your arms and watch them get excited about caregivers and care a lot! The songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how to care for others! When it comes to all the trash that is on TV, you can raise your children to have the right state of mind about life with movies like these.
