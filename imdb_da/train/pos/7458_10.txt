This game is the bomb and this is this year's 007 game and should be on the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire came around and it was better, but now there's a new type of James Bond game. This time it's a 3rd person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics in the game are out of this house. It even has all the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan who once again James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me everything if I spell it wrong). This game would be like the greatest James Bond game around. <br /> <br /> I give this a 10/10
