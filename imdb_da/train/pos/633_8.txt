Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has just begun for this (no page yet? Wth?), So I doubt most of you have heard about it . In truth, I also did not (kind). When I got posted, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried that it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when I'm not working, so I enjoy it 100% as a pure lethal film grille. It turns out it wasn't Transformers, and I had been aware of it far back when "the Neil Gaiman movie". What is it about? In short, it's a Gaiman adventure about a boy and a fallen star. Something more than that, and I would give away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) destroy your fun. If you really want to know what it is about, buy the book. Rumor has it, Gaiman can be a writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so comfortable if the surprise is worthwhile. And for one it was decided. This screening was "special" because it included not only film critics but also exhibitors (they rarely have mixed screening) and local sci-fi / fantasy people. So you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title Stardust, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh how sweet I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's an adventure written by an author famous in comic bookdom. But it was not ringmaster. It was not even another ring of rings of the Wannabe (Ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that. <br /> <br /> But just like the Lord of the Rings, it was humanism in the film that sells the amazing qualities. It is certainly a romantic story, but with generous mood streams. And the humor is of the kind that does not slapstick Shrekism. It's more in tune with dramedy than comedy. Before I continue, let's make this movie review thing. <br /> <br /> At least that's good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantasy movies, but I think there were significant roles. Michelle Pfieffer is unfortunately not one of them. She plays a villain and she does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, was a real jerk. It's a big villain. Peter O'Toole is well, Peter frickin 'O'Toole - who is fantastic. Ricky Gervais is the perfect cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to have too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, he did it. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the protagonist was a good surprise from a guy I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always had a mixed opinion with her. She may be good and then she may seem to miss the mark. In this she is the first. And she is literally the star of this movie. Sure, her accent stumbled here and there. And yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox isn't on stage. But ... well, look for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are still subdued, but only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet - sorry Potter. The direction is light hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better, but not all movies in New Zealand. Everything else is top fitting. <br /> <br /> Now it's done ... <br /> <br /> ... writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. It is difficult in today's climate to do something original, and at first you start to wonder. A kingdom, a dying king, a boy to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you in with his surface knowledge only to undermine it all in a sweet original story of a boy and his heart. And even if you suspect how it all will turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act, and if you are me, find yourself drawn into the awakening climatic confrontation and hope for the best. In the end you will find this story, this movie, is what all adventures should be, but all too often it is not. Wonderful and real. <br /> <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs. Tristan, but I won't spoil it for you. For those who read the book, make sure it's done properly.) <Br> << br /> Those I spoke to had the same impression I did. A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The form is only completed after the film is in great release because you can expect it. You know when you go out anyway. I sincerely hope that Stardust is not lost among the tent poles. Although it does, it will be a pleasure to push in the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> Forgot to add {UNHOLD} reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Perhaps a bit high rating, but I'm still sure the years now form, it will be the same "Oh, I love that movie", answer this as it is for The Princess Bride.
