Having seen both "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that while the same is true, both movies really should look. There will be many times in "Fear" that will get you in hysteria. It is no wonder why both films have such a great cult afterwards. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you need to, but the only way to enjoy this movie is to get it all to yourself.
