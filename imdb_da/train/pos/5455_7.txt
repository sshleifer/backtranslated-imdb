Notorious pre-code movies, really the only movie that made people insist that the Hayes code was tightly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl whose savage father has no problem pinching her out to the customers. When he dies in an accident, she is released into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants. She goes to New York and continues to climb the business ladder, one bed at a time. Although of course there is no actual sex shown, the film is pretty blurry. Unfortunately, after the original shock value drops (around time Stanwyck screws a railroad inspector so she can travel for free), the movie becomes a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck himself is the only thing that keeps the film worth while. As always, she is fantastic.
