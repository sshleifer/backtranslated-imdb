In the early mid-1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of Howard Hughes, claiming to have spent months preparing the book, engaged in interviews with the backward millionaire. As all of this turned out to be false, Irving was charged with injuries and spent several years behind bars (although it was always right to admit his results were correct). Flash up to 20001, several months before September 11, a book entitled "Forbidden Love" (published in the United States as 'Honored Lost: Love and Death in Modern Day Jordan') by a previously unknown author named Norma Khouri, a The woman from Jordan, who reported death with mercy, killed by her best friend Dalia, because Dalia, who was from a devoted Muslim background, was dating a Christian man. What was revealed by Irving's biography of Hughes was a potential hoax. Australian filmmaker, Anna Broinowski, tries to dive into quagmire, which was Khourio's attempt to escape the lies. In 104 minutes, the film will try to reveal that Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just a compulsive blow, with her own agenda / vendetta? Interview footage with those who know / knew her (including a former man, her publisher and others) tells their side of the story. This is a dental, well-produced documentary that manages to point to many fingers in just as many potential guilty parties. Not rated, but contains pervasively poor language and a repetition of the pigs murder scene, played over a couple of times (but nothing nearly as graphic and disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic as Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
