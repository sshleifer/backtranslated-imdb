This movie pulls you in and makes you keep your eyes on the screen. The author / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that everyone adds to the gripping team it wants on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will make you discuss the terms and it takes through the conscious and subconscious. It has a frightening feeling with it being dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan became really insomniac. He is a great actor who is not hard on his eyes either! He really made up his whole being in this role. From the story to the way it is shot, this indie makes for one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and eagerly await to see more from this innovative, creative writer / instructor / film photographer !!!
