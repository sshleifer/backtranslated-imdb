First of all, I want to say that I somehow remember watching this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles, and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you are unable to at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and embrace your inner seven, your old may be able to avoid this movie. That said, I've just seen the restored 137 minute version on DVD, I have to say I enjoyed it, but not as much as when I was seven (I remembered the end). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the movie that are critical, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes both have some really comical moments, my favorite is contrast between scenes performed in the last 10 minutes and that curious choice of backing music (listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there is a lot of focus on the personal stories of particular soldiers and the social dynamics of the group, as the burden of their time travel takes its toll. At the end of the movie I had decided that it was a good thing, since seven myself was the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there are also plenty of pleasing gory action, especially a few epic battle scenes between platon and hordes of shogun era warriors. The film's makers have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and let's see it, humorously. I thought this was an excellent aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say I'm still doing. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers generally do not 'Do not use the film on eggshells and try to avoid altering the space-time continuity; they have heavy caliber guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they are hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs. That's what I'd like to think that a powerful IMDb user would do in their boots. <br /> In short, the movies are worth watching, the viewer regrets that there are no more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time gives some good tips on why a movie like GI Samurai is so unique.
