What is really sad, shows up as Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters is the true reality TV, not the garbage that is no more than glorious game exhibits. I think the soil swells with dissatisfaction has been there in the last few years with much premature cancellation of many shows with a cult following. But with the more vocal backlash fans of Jericho (which I also enjoy) and other shows, networks can begin to reverse this trend. I'm like others, I won't support any new shows until they have another season. I might then make a decision to see and catch up with DVDs and online viewing. Until then, ABC has lost me as a viewer to ANY new show.
