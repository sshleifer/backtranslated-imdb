I love this movie. It is well written and acted and has good filmography. The story mixes action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with beautiful sets and beautiful spells. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. The play is good, and Murphy especially does a good job showing the reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well-developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I cared about what happened to these people and while the result was pretty predictable (the good boys win, the hero gets the amazingly attractive girl and the holy child saves life - who can't see it Comes?), it still made me happy as everything worked well in the end. Thank goodness this film's dignity was never destroyed by a crazy successor. Take some popcorn, cuddle up on the couch and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.
