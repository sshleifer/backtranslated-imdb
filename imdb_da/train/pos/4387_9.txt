This is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is clean and straightforward. In fact, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and richer men of the period. Bad vs. Rich, Honest and Creepy, A classic but well-founded story without much of Hollywood's glitz stinks up on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)
