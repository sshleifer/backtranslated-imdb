I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but four things really stand out: Sam Raimi is perfect comic timing and performance as the camp practical (?) Man, Alan Arkin's wonderful characterization of the tenant and best of all cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of the outer scenes draw me into the movie as a sunset at the lake that draws me into my own summer memories. The dialogue and the mood feel very natural and credible. Some reviewers criticize the lack of a more "in-depth" script. For me, this is precisely the shortage that makes this movie work. The signs and their problems seem right, and so I worry about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all parts come together to create a whole that feels right.
