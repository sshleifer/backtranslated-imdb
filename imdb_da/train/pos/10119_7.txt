Anyone new to the amazingly beautiful Takashi Miike's work might think twice about making this amazing movie their first experience of this truly maverick director. In line with Miike's work practices for taking some work that comes his way, and then digging his own sensibilities on the script, this is in the heart a pretty basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous policeman chasing a gang that his lawyer is fallen into. What, on the other hand, takes the film out of the same old ancient kingdom is the utterly mind-boggling attitude, so some of the most sudden and terrible violence seen in today's cinema. And it's not so cool, cold, pure violence, so loved by American cinema - this is ugly, painful and HURTS! That said, the pace has been eliminated, the characters are unusual without being burdened with stock eccentricities, showing Miike's sense of humor himself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be, which makes it hard to see off the screen, no matter what he might show you! It doesn't have the "Ohmigod" ending with "Dead or Alive", but if you're not worried, it's time to board the Miike wagon before ending up with some Hollywood studios new John Woo shopping list ...
