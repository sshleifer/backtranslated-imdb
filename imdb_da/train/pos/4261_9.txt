I loved this movie. Not only because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, even though he's in almost every German movie that counts. But also because he is not the main actor. The management is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to see 2001's Julietta, and who really carries this movie on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> A family moves from Italy to Germany, seeking "the German dream" (this is my own invention and ironic ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industry. But they end up opening a restaurant, and the journey movie taking to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time fun and charming. From this point on, the story appears mainly from the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gig's dream of becoming a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's will to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can be formed by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie doesn't say what life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It only gives us a rewarding glimpse of how it should be to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. And this appearance is not driven by bitterness or contempt for any country, making it such a good movie for any country dealing with the tensions caused by immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akins moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also gives this film a high degree of credibility and emotional accuracy. Glaze on the cake is great performance of the whole cast, especially Metschurat and - I really have to stress - the little boy playing young Gigi. That the child's performance would be a hard action to follow with almost anyone! Great movie, see it.
