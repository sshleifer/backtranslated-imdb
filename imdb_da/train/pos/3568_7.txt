This film moves the Cinderella story until the early 1950s and does well if eccentric, using the Isle of Man as a backdrop. The ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous English girls in the top class, and together with Kathleen Turner as founder, they flip into various wonderful costumes. The story has changed slightly from the traditional version: early it is strange combined with "King Lear", and in later stages Cinderella is more confident than normal. It looks great and works quite well on the whole, but sometimes goes over the top.
