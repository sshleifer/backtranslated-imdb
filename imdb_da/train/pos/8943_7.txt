1960s TV series Bewitched owes the idea of ​​this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak did right after they were thrown together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as the one, but Novak is just as captivating. <br /> <br /> This was Jack Lemmon's 10th movie and he is good at supporting here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has many good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good at this movie, almost as good at supporting here as she was in The Music Man. Cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is as hexing as any cat in any movie. It's worth seeing as it's a love story with all the feelings of someone and a little magic for boot. It's not Vertigo, but I think because it followed that movie, so the viewers didn't judge it as well as it deserved - it's certainly glad that William Asher saw it as the 1960s were created. I'm not so happy about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.
