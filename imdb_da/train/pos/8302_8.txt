Guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and it's just the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action movie involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. Tough and toothy Gary Busey, usually cast like a villain in these kind of flicks, has his usual crazy charm but is a little more subdued: he does the whole show. Which does not mean that there are not many amazing supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and several other "forgotten" character actors. <br /> <br /> There are probably less action sequences to keep the whole story: Busey has to release a group of "kidnapped" US military elites and return a high-tech "super tank" (a normal tank with a cheesy addition - on the stick to the top) back to the states. <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killing machine more than the evil ones? Of course, this question is asked as in any movie centering on the CIA ... but without being sermon.
