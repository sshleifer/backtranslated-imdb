There are so many "Hollywood" movies made now that not only tortures to look at, but also have no bearing on everyone's life at all. Granted, movies don't always have deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers out there who are interested in telling "human" stories. I don't want to give the distance to this brilliant movie, but the script is probably one of the more complex and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm also a 32-year-old movie bird! Bug ranks top ten on my favorite list, which includes: On the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus just to name a few. This "moving" movie must also be one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
