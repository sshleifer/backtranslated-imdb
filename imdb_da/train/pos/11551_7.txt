ODD PAUPLE (3+ over 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most, I always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the final "Odd Couple". Their incredible work on the television series from the beginning to the mid-70s was a high-water brand of television at that time ... easily surpassing the stage and screen version of the story. Nevertheless, how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau pairing? Matthau is in particularly good shape as Oscar, Slob. Lemmon takes a little getting used to as Felix, especially if you have previously seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance. The script is good ... definitely Neil Simon's best. (I'm going to record here, stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most flooded drama makers of American theater.) The story is simple: Felix, a nice freak and recently separated from his wife joins in Oscar, the slob that needs help saving money for alimentation payments. Their live event is like a marriage that culminates in some entertaining tiffs and spats. Lots of fun and some great one-liners.
