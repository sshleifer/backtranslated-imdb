A May Day 1938, when a big rally celebrates Hitler's visit to Rome, serves as the backdrop for a love story between Antoniette (Sophia Loren) married to the fascist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcello Mastroianni). She is a boring housewife with several sons, and he is an unhappy, lonely homosexual fired from the radio and pursued by the fascists. She is alone in her home when her spouse is going to attend the historic party. So both develop a very pleasant relationship despite their differences. The film is set at the historic meeting of Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with other authorities such as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, describing the events with a radio voice that is sometimes annoying. <br /> <br /> It's a romantic drama made with meaning and sensitivity. An incomparable passionate romance between two opposing characters. Magnificent performances from two pros make a great movie worth seeing. Of course, Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola's sensible manuscript results in still interesting, elaborate and sentimental. Colorless and atmospheric filmography by Pascualino De Santis. Emotional musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif. The film deserved the Golden Globes 1978 for best foreign films. Conductor Scolas imagination stretches to illuminate the limited scenarios in which the drama is developed. Normally, his film takes place in a few stages and is semi-theatrical. For example: Â¨Le Bal (1982) uses a French dance hall to illustrate the changes of society. 2) One of Varennes (1983) is a scene coach, the scenario in which one encounters an unlikely group such as Thomas Paine, Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette who fled the revolutionary Paris 3) family (1987) all take place in the family store old Roman apartment; and of course 4) One Giornata Particulare or one special day where Loren and Mastroianni get a great relationship on their respective apartments and on the flat roof.
