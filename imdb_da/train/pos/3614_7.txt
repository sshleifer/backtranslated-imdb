Girlfight is like your grandmother's cooking: The same old recipe you've tried a million times before, but somehow turned into something fresh and fresh. Try to explain the story to people who haven't seen it before: A young woman from the wrong side of the tracks is trying to improve her situation by taking boxing with a bitter obstructive father and her growing attraction for a male rival. See them rolling their eyes on the string of clichés, and they're right: it's * cliché. Still, I was mesmerized by how well this movie works, because of the often amazing play and dialogue and sensitive direction that makes it new. I avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap, but didn't make the same mistake I made. Definitely worth a look.
