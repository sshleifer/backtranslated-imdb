The year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people. There is only one friend he has, and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They run a cattle herd with them. It would be their key to wealth. In Skagway, they run into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff only needs to get it back and run it through the US Canadian border with Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with them like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There the two men enter the gold industry. Anthony Mann and James Stewart's fourth collaboration, The Far Country (1954) is actually a fine Western. The working work is fantastic. Walter Brennan makes a great side kick to Stewart. Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is lovely. Jay C. The flip is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in minor roles. It is great to see how Jimmy Stewart overcomes all I have problems in the way. There is only the man and his rifle. But he is also vulnerable.
