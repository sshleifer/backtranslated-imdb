I was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary, and I waited a while to get through the pipes (my local video chain) and it was worth the wait. I like a good documentary / special interest piece, but it was definitely a cordial, honest and nostalgic if you want to look back on youth life. The child's imagination is fascinating, and this is where a great story begins. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, humorous and all entertaining documentary. Mr. Stone and firm have certainly come a long way from neighboring video camcorder productions of bank hold-ups and gay rings that make people gay from a glance. They all seem quite successful in being respectful fields, and it was good to know that they are all still good friends. The DVD has a couple of extra trailers for other good documentaries, and it includes a number of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
