This film is one of the funniest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that has apparently penetrated the Balkans once again, 45 years after the depicted time. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, grief and love combined that it is impossible to determine whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate answer. The accuracy of the depiction and timelessness of the types, however, makes it a good movie to see if one will understand a little of what drove ex-Yugoslavia to his madness. In fact, no diplomat who deals with the region must try anything before they see this movie and its twin, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
