I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. This movie was not meant to be a "deep thought" movie, which is the vast majority of reviewers seem to think it should be. In fact, if any movie doesn't produce a life-changing insight and a deep, twisted, funny crooked plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. Don't fire a movie because you don't like the genre, the people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an Action / Comedy flick, and that was all it was supposed to be. And for an action / comedy it was very well done. In fact, I was pretty surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did when I had never been a Jamie Foxx fan and had it over used plot it has. <br /> <br /> The reason was nothing spectacular about using the typical criminal coming out of prison and being thrown into a bad man while trying to clean up his action (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours etc etc), but it was heated with a bit of a technological twist. Now the "evil boys" are actually the "good guys" and the real "bad guy" is a uber-geek. <br /> <br /> In fact, Jamie Foxx plays a convincingly humorous while being a rather intelligent and serious protagonist, and did not attempt to exaggerate the humor of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep underlying plot like in "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of Mouse and Men" then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast movie recording and an occasional twist of humor thrown in, this movie won't disappoint you. I would normally have rated it an 8 (at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try to bring the score to what it was supposed to be. <br /> <br />
