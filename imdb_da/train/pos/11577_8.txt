This was a really cool movie. It just goes to prove that you don't have stupid little things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It crosses continents in seconds, people are shot and nothing happens to them, swords on fire, samuari fighting on sinking galons, David Essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the guy. I enjoyed this movie, but I like s ** t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s ** t movie that just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you'll love this movie, its swashbuckling, its fast, the silly, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It also looks like it was made in 1972
