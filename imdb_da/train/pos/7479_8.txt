"The sweet is never so sweet without the sour." This quote was essentially the theme of the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was entrusted with everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around in full swing in this amazing movie with a fantastic twist. This movie will keep you engaged in the plot and not able to pause it to take a bathroom break. It's a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You can't really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you've experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really make you "open your eyes". Only complaint is that the film becomes very twisted on points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect. I recommend you see it and see for yourself.
