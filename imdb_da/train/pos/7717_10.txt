I have loved this movie all my life. It's also such an intelligent story with lots of classic allusions. eg. The ship that passed away for decades was called Bellerophon. Well in classical mythology, it was the man who killed the chimera, a legendary animal composed of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is obviously the chimera and his Id monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies where the authors have clearly credited their audience with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters who spend $ 150m on special effects, but about $ 1.50 on a manuscript. <br /> <br /> Bowl
