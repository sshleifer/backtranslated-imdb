I had to watch the whole movie last night, and I found it very exciting. It was at least not like the teen-slasher movies that pop out now and then. The search for the killer and the "partner" relationship between the hero and the so-called bad guy were parts I liked about the movie. Also I remember once being on the edge of my seat under a particular scene in the movie. I think it's exciting. It may be a while later I can watch the movie again. ..
