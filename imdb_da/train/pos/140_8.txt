Normally I don't like series at all. They are all predictable and they tend to become boring and boring very quickly. However, these series are well played, the story goes through all the episodes, and even if you miss one, the story will still grab your mind. The episodes are all filmed in a hospital and take you further and further into the mysteries of dark and ancient secrets just below the surface of the mighty hospital.
