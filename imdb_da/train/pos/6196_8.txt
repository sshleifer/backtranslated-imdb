Fay, the sister of the notorious Nobel laureate, poet Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool. Their son receives a brilliant orgy-in-one box from an unannounced consignor, and a hunt across three continents follows, involving an exceedingly sad-sack collection of government agents, terrorists, airmen, and bell shops. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey provides a perfect workout, including brilliant physical work. With strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves in the best Billy Wilder tradition that nothing is more fun than a beautiful woman in trouble. Another good score by Hartley (and thanks to the credits to the US Academy in Berlin, where Hartley earned a scholarship in the fall of 2004).
