I came across "bait" on cable one night just as it started and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a try. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. It suffers unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional stupidity. But overall, this film worked. All the elements justified right and they struck off what might otherwise have been a pretty nasty movie. <br /> <br /> I think most of it is due to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who labeled Foxx for the lead, but who it was, made this movie a great service. Trustworthy and incredibly sympathetic, Foxx slides through the movie, smooth as butter and more fun than hell. You can tell that he is working on instinct, and instinct does not fail him. <br /> <br /> The reason, while insignificant, actually links quite well, and there is even an arc of character through which Foxx's character grows as a person. Again they could have passed without any of this, but it just does things that much better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this movement on the right night, or vice versa, but I would give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
