I like this presentation - I've read Bleak House, and I know it's so hard to present the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they did a really good show with the staged Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg, and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even through the arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce, but I'm fine with Mr Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be easier - it is long and if you do not care about all the legal situations, it can be boring or boring. I think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring. I just loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be entertaining. There's always a kid - Jo wants to break your heart here ... I think we should have a chance to judge for ourselves ... I must say I loved the show. Maybe if I read the book again, which I usually do after watching the movie, I might be more critical. Meanwhile - I think it's a good presentation.
