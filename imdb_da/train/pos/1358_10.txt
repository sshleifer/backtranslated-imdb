Season after season, the players or characters in this show seem to be people you will absolutely love to hate. Is this show rigged to be, or were they chosen for the same? Each episode destroys a single person specifically, and he ends up being knocked off. You enjoy watching them get screwed even though it's completely wrong and sick. You enjoy watching them screw others, get screwed yourself, play dirty, get it back, escape and finally get kicked out of Trump. The number of tears also appears to be increasing during the season. <br /> <br /> The rewards that attempt to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also greatly reduced. In the newer seasons, it's like "You're going to meet xyx who will talk about you uvw" .. as who freaking cares? The characters are so hateable, collectively and individually that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only wise one gets to win. <br /> <br /> Be aware and maintain a conscience. It's your fellow men in the line of fire.
