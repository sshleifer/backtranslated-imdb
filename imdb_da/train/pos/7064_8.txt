Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and made it possible to remain a major study. By the mid-30s, most of the great directors who had been with Universal, for example. Milestone, gone. Browning and Wyler had gone. Only James Whale remained, but his prestigious horror movie was behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland performed in a short "Every Sunday", and initially Garland was proposed for Penny's role in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was not available, Universal switched to Durbin. Originally, she had been a supportive player, but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by the Henry Koster film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in "Switzerland". The title "three smart girls" - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) sail with Penny, giving his brilliant voice to "My Heart is Singing". Everything is not so good from home - their father is planning to marry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes), so the three girls with the help of their faithful nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and reunite him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for his role as Robert Taylor's stubborn mother in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who, along with his crazy mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For anyone without a movie experience, Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical pesky, over enthusiastic nurse, and she is as beautiful as a picture. When she sings "Somebody to take care of me" to her father, you just want to melt - what a brilliant voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the movie. When her father consolidates her with "I take you to the zoo tomorrow," she replied, "Oh I can see enough monkeys in here"! <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a "count" (Mischa Auer) for the romance Donna. They arrange to meet at a night club, but because of a mixed Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) he fails the count, and Donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of Australia !!!) The plan goes back as he falls for Kay and Donna want to speed up her marriage with Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take the case in her hands and runs away. She is taken to the local police station, where she charms the police with her release of "Il Bacio" (she tries to convince them that she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with their mother (Nella Walker) sailing to the patch things up with their dad and meanwhile Donna acquainted with phoney count (Mischa Auer) and sails to Australia with him. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
