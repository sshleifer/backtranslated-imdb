Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks after redemption by radically transforming his life into seven people whom he does not know. Once his plan is set, nothing will stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben had not planned to fall in love with one of these people, and she is the one who ends up transforming him. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino, after the life inspirational film "The pursuit of Happiness". "Seven Pounds" is yet another life-changing movie experience that not only reminds you of their previous collaboration, tearful, but finally inspires you with joy. Will Smith is also the producer again with some of the others. These films are very realistic, showing the life of a common man and his struggle through life. Seven pounds could have taken some time to make it work, but just after half an hour in the movie, the movie is set to control your heart. Also, this movie has some twists and turns that allow viewers to guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner all the way, with his emotional but inspirational message. He makes all the film's characters very real, that the people would actually find themselves somewhere in the movie. Together with the director, Will Smith is another winner, with his amazing plays. Once again, the duo works for the instructor and the actor as a charm. There are also other talented actors in the movie who did their part quite well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with brains, that's what she can call. She looks beautiful and makes her part very good. Barry Pepper gives great support to the movie & Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody didn't have much screen timing (would have been good if he had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Top class cinema!
