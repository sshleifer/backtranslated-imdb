This documentary follows the life of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter who lived back in their family home in East Hampton, NY from the mid-50s in the late 70s. When the filmmakers find them, the mansion falls apart, and the women, a 78 and the other 56, share a crooked room. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and the younger is her first cousin. The women were initially exposed from the house because of its weak condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so that they could stay there. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, this movie may seem useful as neither woman seems to be in the best of mental health, but at other times the movie is hard to see away. "Little" Edie claims her mother for her current state, and her mother is burning back that Edie would never be the success she thought she was. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focused on choices she made decades ago, and loves to show pictures of her youth, where she was clearly a beautiful debut. Her mother seems more laid off for her destiny, to live the rest of her life in horrible conditions. There are concrete hints about the glamorous life, both women once lead from the pictures showing a happy family to the great portrait of the older Edie next to her bed. From what we see from the house, most of the rooms are in the empty, the walls crack and fall apart, and "Little" Edie leaves food in the ceiling for racoons to feast on. And of course there are many cats running around. <br /> <br /> In its heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. While none of the women seem to be particularly depressed by their mass in life, the bias they live in is absolutely horrible. It is not quite clear if there is even running water in the house and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family. <br /> <br /> But as a documentary, the movie is a wonder to see and highly recommended.
