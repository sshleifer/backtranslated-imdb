Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for some time now and owning some of his books, I had some expectations for what I wanted to see. What I got was something quite satisfactory and a little more than I expected. Being an artist myself (I work in clay), finding inspiration in our surroundings to make good art is absolutely necessary, and that is something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. Following him in a year, the director takes the spontaneous energy, skill, and devotion to the artist's connection with nature with a drop of inspirational flair. The music for the film is embracing and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or someone else who needs an uplifting experience, SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there. To create, dance, break with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
