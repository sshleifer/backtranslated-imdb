This film has a strong philosophical ending. But it's only meaning if you see the movie from the start. <br /> <br /> In the late 1960s, youth enrichment, from a youth and youth perspective, is the obvious theme of "Zabriskie Point". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much acting experience, a fact that actually enhances the film's message. Having untrained actors gives a sense of realism, as both players are emotionally separated from the turmoil around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a script driven movie. Apart from the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with fantastic filmography. The beautiful naturist images seem different and perfect in synchronization with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with The Door's more compelling music. Many scenes shout at "Riders On The Storm". <br /> <br /> I still think about this movie. It is different; it is unique; It is artistic and imaginative. And the desert's badlands are beautiful. As the years go by, "Zabriskie Point" seems more and more attractive. It conveys the mood of the late 1960s in America. It is incredibly artistic, in a bohemian kind of way. And the film's last eight minutes is philosophically fascinating.
