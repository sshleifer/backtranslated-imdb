This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both extremely creative and openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire camps were revealed. While at the end of 1944 and in 1945 it was revealed how bad and terrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood movies to date, is the most brutally honest movie in the era I have seen in Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The movie begins in the courtroom in the future - after the war is over (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictional world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unjustified, and one by one witnesses who reveals Grimm's life since 1919 in a number of flashbacks. Initially, it appears that the film will be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. But after a while it becomes very clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are incredibly well done and surely hold your interest and make the movie less like a propaganda piece, but a legitimate drama. All in all, the film does a good job compared to the movie mostly stars second class actors. There are many convincing scenes and performances - especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end, which cannot help bring you close to tears. It was also interesting that around the same point in the movie there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way that you may not notice first. All in all, it is a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to watch a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This is not a serious criticism of the movie, but Hitler was referred to as "the paper clip". This is a reference to the myth that Hitler once made money on the loss. This is actually not true - earlier he had been a "starving artist", homeless and well served in the German army in WWI. A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hangman!
