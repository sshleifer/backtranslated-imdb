I was going to give it a 8, but since you made 6.5 out of much better voices, I had to make up my contribution. The river Styx was pure genius. Well, Woody was his perennial, but his role was at least appropriate. The first half hour was really fun, and then the rest of the movie was easy to see. The dialogue was clever enough and Woody's card tricks on the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to see. It was much better than the newspaper's critics made it happy. And a plus, a little Sorcerer's apprentice to follow. And of course you noticed that Johansen is getting a little frumpy? Charles Dance is always entertaining, like Hugh Jackman.
