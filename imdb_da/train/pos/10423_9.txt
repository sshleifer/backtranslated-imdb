Yes, be my love was Mario Lanza's skyrocket for fame and is still popular today. His voice was strong and stable, so powerful that MGM decided to use him in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book by Kostelanitz, who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant practice and vocal education became the visionary Caruso of Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a fantastic job in history, but the story is not quite true; blame it on Hollywood! I used to sing his songs many years ago and became quite good myself until I lost my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
