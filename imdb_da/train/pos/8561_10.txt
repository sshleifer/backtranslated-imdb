When two authors make a play of a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany's, you know something goes right. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are outstanding actors. The FBI agent was a horrible actor. The scenes where Patrick looked Holly up and down as a kind of lens, they were just weird. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big part. The strange rubber band was just weird. Nathan was a very nice cat. But what was the scene where Patrick followed Holly into a cesspool and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What is he doing around there? And not every man has a female, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor's, it was weird.
