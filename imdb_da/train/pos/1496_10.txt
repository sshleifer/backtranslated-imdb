Enjoyed capturing this movie on late late late television and it kept my interest throughout the picture. This wonderful scary yet mysterious English home with wicked decorations and woven furniture and rooms makes you wonder why anyone would like to rent this home or even own it. There are four (4) tales of this house, and each resident of the home faces all sorts of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet song of birds, but don't let it fool you, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", 80 gives a great performance as one of the people living in the home and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid ) a wonderful exciting story together love his daughter for some reason to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you love crazy, terrible and mysterious movies, with many surprises, it's the MOVIE for you!
