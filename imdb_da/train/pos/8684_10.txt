This is one of the first and best Columbos, with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, like several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made a later appearance. In this one, Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has an affair so he hires Culp to investigate. Culp has a blackmail on the side, so he gives Milland a false report and threatens Crowley with the right one if she doesn't pay up. They come into a big battle in Culp's home, and she wins up the murder. Enter Columbo. <br /> <br /> Culp does everything he can to get Columbo out of the case, including offering him a job, but Columbo is on him from the start. Excellent episode.
