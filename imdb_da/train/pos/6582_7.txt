Okay, then there's a picture from the front of a Checker taxi, probably the late 1930s model. It has the large triangular headlights. There is also a DeSoto cabin in this black and white, character-driven, almost a musical love that has gone wrong. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is the look of the 1940s room interior and fashion and hotel elevators. Hair styles, male and female are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature hair, she could have made it big. There is an artist ceiling that would be the envy of any Andy Warhol wannabe. <br /> <br /> If you see this expecting a great Casablanca story or the Sound of Music oom-pah pah, you'll be disappointed. There is a nice little story under the runway model in this movie. <br /> <br /> My copy on DVD with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was cute, but not up there with Food, Food, Food, Food World or The Pink Panther. This was an RKO movie, but it did not have the red fly logo that RKO used to use. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature in One Million, B.C. and Sampson and Delilah and especially in violent Saturday. See if you can find one. He was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson continued to make I lead three lives on television in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature was offered that part of Sampson's father in the recovery of Sampson and Delilah. He was probably asked if he would have trouble playing his father's part when he was as famous as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is right, I play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
