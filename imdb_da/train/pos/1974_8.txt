I think the reason for all the perceived diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it off Sharon Stone being about 50 and being naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the golden girls were sitting around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone who posts menopausal becomes digitally satisfied while driving, it's just too much for some to handle. Let's see it well, she looks good, she is light years warmer than my mother who is of the same age! It's not an Oscar or a Cult classic as the first, but ever since the turn of the century it's all movie guests seem to expect: a movie experience that will touch your soul. As such, it does not claim to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and exciting, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It is the character of Catherine Trammell who helped make room for this successor. Fans of the first movie want to see more of the frosty ice queen. <br /> <br /> The cinema and art direction was lush and extravagant and made me move to the Britian for sure. The score is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> It is certain that some characters are somewhat overbearing, but there is some brilliant work by David Morrissey that is largely unknown. There is a setback in that the script is pretty much the same as the first movie that only connects to a psychiatrist instead of the policeman. And the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to be cut even more, which takes away from the guilty joy known for. <br /> <br /> At least it is entertaining and fun to look at, and that's the only intent of the movie. So if you have beef with Mizz Stone, you may have to SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before spitting your projectile throats?
