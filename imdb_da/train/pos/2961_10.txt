This is the only David Zucker movie that does not spoof anything like the first of its kind. The Funniest Movie of 98 with Night at Roxbury Just Behind But I didn't think anything about Mary was fun, so it doesn't count with the franc and the prayers, he he. Don't listen to the critics, especially Roger Ebert, he doesn't know solid entertainment, just look at his reviews. Totally see it, you won't be dissapionted
