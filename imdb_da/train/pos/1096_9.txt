I first saw this movie in 1980 in the spotlight of the dinner game. After many subsequent considerations (and buying the video) it still makes me laugh aloud. Yes, it is a relic of another age - a homely comedy set in wealthy middle-class America - but well done is well done. But it's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism, baby boom and the growing consumer age. This movie is not "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three Wonderful Sophisticated Leaders - Urban Melvyn Douglas; bemused Cary Grant; daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters. My favorite scenes - "That means we have to blow" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> <br /> love it.
