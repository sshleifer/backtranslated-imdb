The best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It is like a good pilot for a television series. I even think it's a bit "cool", like a little touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic, or something. They have caught a great deal of modesty, but I admit missing Willy Garwin a bit. Although I have read many comics and book by Peter O'Donnell, I am not disappointed with this movie, on the contrary. Pleasantly surprised by this story of Modesty and her childhood. I didn't make my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966. So I might have exaggerated this movie just a little. But if you like the comics and other storys about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this! can't wait for a follow up ...
