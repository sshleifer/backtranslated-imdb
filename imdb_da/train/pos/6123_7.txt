Before I comment on this movie, realize that when I watched this movie, I expected the typical crap, horror, B-movie and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only supplies but is actually one of the best I've seen for a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, I actually think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if he has ever given the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through a stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as the snowman starts to move around and kill people, you will find it hard not to laugh. The lines that are said to be completely retarded, but really fun. The fact that the rest of the throws completely over-acts just adds to the stupidity of the movie, but it's stupidity is that genius. The scene where the snow is with the teenage girl is really classic in B-movie, horror movie fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I will be right there to see what cable channel does. Of course, it's only fun to watch the first few times, and it's not exactly a good job of film technology, but I like to see the snowmen killing people. I gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
