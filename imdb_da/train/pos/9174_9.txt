There have been many film and television productions by Jane Eyre, each of which has aspects to recommend them, but I suppose this is the one that people will still discover and fall in love for decades from now on. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; His performance is amazingly shiny and multicolored, while never inconsistent with the dark complexity of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more brain than World War II, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (as appropriate tears over her!) The nuances of her performance come better through another view (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical flaws and a few moments where the production values ​​could have been better; Although this was basically a top-of-the-line production of BBC standards at that time. But these are the ideas that are the right pleasure. Don't miss this one!
