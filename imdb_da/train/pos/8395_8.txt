*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It is undoubtedly the best movie Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made, and even with the amazing script, the movie is enhanced by an excellent performance by Hanna Schygulla. Movies start with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just gets married, as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is sent out against the declining days of war, and now Maria and her mother and sister are scraping off to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club addressing US GIs, and she meets a black soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they begin to see each other evenly. Maria hears that her husband Hermann is dead in the war, so she becomes very serious with Bill. But one day while they are intimate with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He's not dead, and when he enters the room, a junk occurs, and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann blames him, and he's sentenced to long term in prison, so Maria tells him she'll succeed in something and get him out. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild and one day at a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), a successful businessman in textiles, and she uses her charm to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the company's ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. She tells him she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann comes out of jail, but goes to Canada to try to get over everything Maria has done since he is locked. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day, Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything in his will, and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife, and they are both ready to start their marriage, even though they have been married for some time now. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove, and the house explodes with them both in it. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this movie that it is one of the movies that can be studied and talked about in great lengths. Like all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins, the tones are brown and gray to represent the war-hair Germany, but as Maria begins to succeed, they change into bright rich colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the sound of construction is used as the sole background and the film is focused on the exploitation of Maria. Fassbinder wanted the sound of rebuilding to remind us of what was happening in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla was never better, and her performance is the key to the success of this movie. With a minor actress, it would have been just another interesting movie, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance lifts this movie into an elite state. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed or guilty of this, and Fassbinder wanted to show Mary as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award, but she did a fantastic performance that will stand the time test. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard many things about the end of the movie, and it has to do with whether Maria deliberately left the gas. Later in the bathroom she runs water over her wrist and she looks sad. This is only speculation, and if you think I'm wrong, send me an email. I think she was too excited that Hermann was at home and left it by accident (remember that she has not dressed a dress for no reason). So when the will is read to her, it is at that time that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge, and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing. That's the reason for the bathroom. So when the house accidentally explodes. But I think the reason why Fassbinder has such a conclusion is to show that anyone who wanted to sell their soul has nothing to live in. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. Maria doesn't think he can have it either way. A fascinating film.
