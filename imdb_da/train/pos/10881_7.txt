"Cut" is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and essentially achieves what it stands to do. Most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house, the forest, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, the gore jumpers and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while having sex (it's hardly a spoiler). The set-up is simplicity itself: movie-school geeks set out to complete an unfinished slasher "masterpiece", unfinished because of the murders of a couple of casts. This also nicely - okay, messily - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the movie because she gets all the best lines. The rest of the role fits well with their roles, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays it straight while chaos and gore are breaking around her. <br /> <br /> There are lots of red herring and fake exciting moments, and there is very little time trying to figure out who the killer is, because the movie is moving at such a fast pace. It also has a suitably low budget look, including some clumsy editing, which is likely to be conscious. Good soundtrack too. If there is a problem with this movie, it is crucial whether it is a send-up or a tribute to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
