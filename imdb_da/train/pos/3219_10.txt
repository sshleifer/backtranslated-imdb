This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, a great character, very good acting and killing action. This takes place mainly in the year 2036, but shows scenes that take place in the past years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no gaps. Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is educated from birth to killing, and who all other soldiers have never had normal life. Eventually, the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they have no need for the old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by getting them to fight some of the old soldiers, in the fight Russell is injured and believed to be dead. The military dumps his body as well as fewer others, assuming they are all dead, but what they do not realize is that Russell lives. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him. For a while he lives there, but cannot adapt to normal life. He rarely says a word, and he is sometimes very aggressive towards the other people. When they feel that he is a danger to them, they send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> Just as Russell leaves the planet is being attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart as Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd throws them lightly. The military begins to realize this, and Todd kills all their men, but one. One is Jason Scott Lee and finally you see a classic battle scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell obviously comes out on top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a movie, including some great lines. The author also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, even calling himself women "sir". There are no gaps in this movie, every minute has a purpose and it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> An amazing one man army action movie for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / sci-fi fans.
