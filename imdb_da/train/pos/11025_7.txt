Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, admirable in making this movie an expert climber who finds himself in the hostage with a fellow friend at a gang of dangerous criminals in search of suit cases full of cash stolen the mountainous mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as the Gabe Walker expert climber especially in the action / battle sequences, but some of them border entirely on unrealistic. For the sake of the movie, although I will suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. The action / battle sequences are well done, but as mentioned before, some are not very realistic, no matter how hard you are. The climbing sequences, however, are very well done, because instead of making the whole movie in a studio somewhere, the places they chose, felt really real, and the Ariel view of the mountain ranges is wonderful and adds a touch of reality to the movie. The dead are inventive, while others are kind of predictable. The bad guys are firm, but it would have been better if they had focused on one more central rather than having many of them. The pacing of the film was a bit slow, but the good one outweighs the bad in it. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone than the chances, you will also enjoy this. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, little excitement, excitement, excitement and good performances by the player that makes this movie worth watching.
