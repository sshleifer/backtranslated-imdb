The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty, also made for a Disney movie in 1959; This movie is a sweet, enchanting Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good soundtrack; it's one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack, and i also love the songs; My favorite song is the romantic "So this is love." I also love the mouse from the movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the story; the little birds tried to awaken Cinderella in the morning; I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (the mice and the birds) solve Cinderella's maternity's dress so she could go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia tore it to bits, b **** es!
