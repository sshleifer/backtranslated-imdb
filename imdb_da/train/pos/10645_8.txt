Adolf Hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven-part series of films produced by the US War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the defense during World War II. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-thought-out, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, which grew into the European Heart Area and then on to 'World Island' consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His final step would be to reach over the oceans for the ultimate conquest of America and the World. In 1935, Hitler ordered national notice when the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. Grade schoolchildren sang his praise, and young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. Followed by the emergency in Austria in 1938, Hitler followed a string of countries bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939 Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was stunned to learn that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with its deadly enemy Russia, a move to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately afterwards, Germany invaded Poland, giving Hitler's conquest right to Russia's doorstep. He would deal with her later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's press across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he had a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous declaration of peace of our time. It didn't turn out like that. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information to be learned at this rate, at least for me, was provided by a small piece of footage from a German pro Hitler rally in the mid-30s. It was led by a German American who took his cue directly from home. The Place - Madison Square Garden!
