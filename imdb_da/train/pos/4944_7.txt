Not so many things happen in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but in fact it was not true, and she found out she met the person who led some studies for her next job. There should really be several types of movies like this, I'm not even as old as considered "mature" (im 13 by the way) and I still have the idea and the point in the movie. The main point is in my opinion: Don't think you can't have a better life just because you currently have this. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit, I was thinking of watching another movie, but after reading all the reviews and watching the trailer, I decided on this one, even though I didn't know much would happen in the movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the movie and it is a great ending.
