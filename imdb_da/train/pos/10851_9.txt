I found 'Still Crazy' to be wonderfully entertaining, and not just those of us who lived through the fierce era of the late 60s, early 70s. My 15 year old daughter sees it with me every time I pull out the DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too. It's a really loving, exciting and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy, and I am glad that his slightly similar 'Love Actually' tour gave him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible like Brian, giving real life to what could have been a caricature of the dusty rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made a name for himself as an author. I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I hit into Billy Connolly at a local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite movies all the time. He invited me to sit down on the mat with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​a US-oriented remake before we wisely dismissed it. Why root in the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Still Crazy" is that it was not very popular in theaters and for many people missed out on a wonderful experience.
