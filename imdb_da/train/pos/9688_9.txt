I approach movies about talking animals with care. For every wonderful, like Babe, you get as poor as the terrible remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of cats and dogs you have a good idea for a movie that does not live up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the performance of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly satisfy me. But I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And you manage to sneak into your heart without realizing it. <br /> <br /> A Russian caretaker, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he examines, he finds a parrot in the cage sings his little heart out. Misha gets fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out that the parrot can not only sing, it can speak. And not a few sentences either. It's a parrot you can actually talk to. <br /> <br /> The parrot is named Paulie (pronounced by Jay Mohr) and recognizes a colleague in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, convinces Misha Paulie to tell him his life story. As everyone began when he was a baby, and in Marie's care, a five-year-old girl with a stutter. The two became birds of a feather (OK, bad saying!). When Mary's parents became worried about her close friendship with a bird, they thought they would send him away. And they finally did after Marie almost injured herself in an autumn when they taught Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey throughout America, which includes a varied number of new owners flying large distances and even ending up behind bars. A cage is there! Paulie was one of a series of talkative animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And even though it wasn't the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds at a few levels and is an occasional work of striking intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand-up style of action is suitable for Paulie. He never plays the role of the alley, even though he is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paulie is mundane, but he is also naive in his way. Because he has lived a fairly protected life with Marie, he must, once he has gone away, have to survive for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, as he thinks. Only for them promises to be broken again and again. <br /> <br /> Although Paulie is a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with and how he slowly gets closer to Marie. He first wins in a peasant shop where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a friendly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and drives an RV across America to find Marie. Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Magnificent moments of Paulie lie on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she submits in him is the need for hope great, and some of the dialogue is pretty well written and even thought-provoking: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you reject because you believe I will do But the right thing that Ivy taught me is that you have to live as if it shouldn't be later. <br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy passes away, Paulie leaves alone, is A very heart-rending moment, and the order in which he picks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, shoots majestically, is such a beautifully composed scene that stays with you for hours after the movie's over. br /> <br /> Despite the occasional sad moment, there is lots of laughing, Paulie falls in with a group of executive parrots in a Spanish outdoor restaurant, the animatronic effects here are really good as four birds do it Perfectly choreographed dance number, and Paulie even gets a romance, which is dotted when he falls with a small thief (played by Mohr too). It may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you become comfortable with a situation, the film Paulie moves on to another. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is fun, but also a little disturbing. I am amazed DreamWorks was given the opportunity to include such a scene in a children's film. And Paulie's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible. He is trapped in the action and sent to the laboratory for animal testing where he has been ever since. <br /> <br /> The story finally comes in full circle at the lab, where Misha promises to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity that I was left numb for several minutes. Paulie must never get the lifetime Babe has, but I think it's an equally brilliant movie. The same laughs. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A smaller gem.
