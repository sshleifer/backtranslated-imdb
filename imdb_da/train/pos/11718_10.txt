Those who love Elivra, as I did in her movie hostess, will love this movie - she's simply cool. Her car is amazing and she is a bit of a Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she is so innocent and naive at times - and sexy all the time - plus more than a touch of the Mae West sets are also well done, and the comic cast is amazing with Edie McClurg at her usual best - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is fun. Every time I have to crush something for a topping, I think about how Elvira crunches potato chips - <br /> <br /> This movie is one to be seen over and over - just for fun. Now I have to get the successor to it, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it lives up to this ----
