Something about "Paulie" touched my heart when few movies do. It's a witty, funny but emotional movie. I'm a late come to become a fan of this movie. I didn't see "Paulie" until May 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a eBay seller. <br /> <br /> The special effects of showing Paulie talking are excellent. My son asked me how the bird knew so many sentences. I'm probably my favorite part of the movie when Paulie is in Gena Rowland's (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as the good heart man. You've got him all the way through the movie. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with renting or buying this movie !!
