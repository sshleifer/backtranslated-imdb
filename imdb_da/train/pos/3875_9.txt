This film is made by one of the most absurd humorists in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy, but knowing that he was a heavy cinephile was seen at every local festival and in local cinema I had a positive sense of this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell I was right. Just outside the bat, the scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a little twisted and hard to follow, but in Pelletier's fashion there is a 90 minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> Loosely inspired and mostly transformed connection to dangerous connections (of Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game with notes on the fridge. Throughout the film you get the opportunity to find out who is who and who is writing to who is on this goddam fridge .... who appears in an interesting love affair. Great story, great photography, good quotes from other movies. Should we ask more about a first movie?
