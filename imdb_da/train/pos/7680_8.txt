"Holly" is a problem-driven movie, but it is neither manipulative nor too sentimental. In his heart, it is a character-driven movie that would not be nearly as successful without the unfolding exhibitions of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakened conscience and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the highly-wanted but eventually matching young Vietnamese girl. From the living places and photography to the effective editing, everything is fair and well done. The modern classic score may initially set a little off, but it is state-of-the-art composition and emphasizes the admirable restraint that is overtly everywhere. This movie, which raises many problems but gives few clear answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness and compassion for Holly and the many who share her situation. Kudos to those who managed to get it done.
