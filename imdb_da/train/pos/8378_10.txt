What a good movie it is. The concept of nations sending people, fighting each other with giant robots, is sticky. The end is not just an appropriate one, but it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm fascinated by the characters. It's a shame we never see the relationship between Achilles and Athena more developed than just a few kisses and Athena's fear of Achilles safety. Their romance is very fun. <br /> <br />
