I watched this movie when it was released and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember the wonderful scenes about how the hero / hero flies every time they face danger :) And the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! I think many so-called action movies copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not only does it never impress me when I see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main players have acted wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of chemistry b / w hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and conflicts was something that can make children realize the value of true love, sacrifice and care. I recommend that each person watch this movie when they get a chance !! --Vijay.
