This stood out for his originality. I'm seriously tired of watching Hindi movies, which is a hotch-potch of a whole lot of Hollywood and Brit movies. Some errors were inevitable, but the film is a must-see. Surya's portrayal of the purified, conscientious policeman (unlike the pot-bellied-money-hungry ones we normally see) was fantastic. He has come a long way from his work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. I am usually not in the type of thoughtless violence type of film, somehow I have actually felt for each character and therefore cannot really call me 'mindless' violence. I appreciate the exaggerated melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I absolutely loved this movie because it lacks the same. ACP Anbuselvan's response to losing his wife is not overdone, is heartbreaking and makes me bend my eyes out. There are certain times when I watch a movie when I want to hit the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it at a cinema hall. Never wanted to do that when you watch this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be released soon.
