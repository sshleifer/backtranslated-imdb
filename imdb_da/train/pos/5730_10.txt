Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland might be in favor of no one except Lynch and that's what makes it fun and a collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Blasphemy? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful image of some Americans who do not have brains and hit wife and children for fun. From MÃ©xico I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1 - My teeth bleed, all noise around and violence makes me scream and put me behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! Yes, baby, get it and learn a lesson: some people are never grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. The more Lynch episode of everything, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
