The last hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western. The theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films, but never so savagely. Robert Taylor's counterpart as the occupied buffalo and Indian killer is his best achievement. In the 1950s, your mother let you and your friends out on saterday matin√©e, usually featuring a western or comedy. But it was wrong now and then to let a youth see psychotics like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before being exposed to films of repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. Why didn't Mother meet censorship? Because they contained "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climatic scene in The Last Hunt is as horrific as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> Mythology of the White Buffalo, part of the text of this movie, was later torn by other films including The White Buffalo, with Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians. Today, a large residual bison is inhabited in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In the winter, hunger forces excess animals out of the park into Montana, where they are sometimes harvested by Idaho's Nez Perce Indians under an American treaty that rules the Lincoln Presidency. Linclon signed the congressional act, which approved the continental rail and started the buffalo.
