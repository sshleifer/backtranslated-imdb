The Woman In Black was a British made for television film, which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of '89 and again in '92. I think it did a round of American TV on A & E. It was released on VHS in the UK in the early 90s but went out of print. An American company launched it on DVD later, but that version was also sold out. According to the book's author's website, the rights to the movie are now owned by another and that it will not be released again and that there are unofficial bootlegs sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I recently heard about this movie on a bulletin board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It's safe to be faked from a salesman in the Far East, even though the DVD says "made in Canada" haha. But it's a good copy, and you can't really fault the bootleg labels to release rare, out-of-print, and lost legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a period piece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and picturesque British settings of that time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very low but effective and scary. There is nothing self-sufficient to do, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create completely chilling moments. It is a chilling classic style movie. The film itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930s except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I'm afraid this movie will always always be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my favorites all the time.
