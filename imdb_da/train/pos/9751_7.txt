At one point there were different types of movies. These different films co-existed, although each one had something else to offer. <br /> <br /> It seems obvious at first, but I thought I would point it out during this review, because some people may have forgotten this is just a funny movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all it is. It does not claim to be anything else or anything bigger. People who reject it as something that does not have a promise cannot see the whole picture - literally. Hollywood is constantly making films that are shameless vehicles for people (Bodyguard or the Priest's Wife with Whitney Houston are 2 examples to come to mind.) First, I would like to handle movies as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The song is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The movie starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallos Matinatta. Pav singer arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music as "I left my heart in San Francisco" and the song nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe, "If we were in Love" w / music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all 3 former Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so it will obviously not be deeply or universally applicable to the average movie viewer. It's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night in the opera years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, he loses "NY" in NYC's voice from fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-Lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold - gives him a shot to heal his psychosomatic reaction. He gives her the chance to flirt with him and she reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> They go into an affair, she knows he's married and promising not to fall in love with him, and he thinks she's just another woman. In spite of all that they fall in love (so the song "IF we were in love") and with her help he overcomes his fears and goes back to MET where he triumphs. I don't want to tell you how it ends, but it's pretty predictable. It's not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The performance in this is not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you expect a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hank's performance, you will be deceived, not Pavarotti. He knows he's not a thespian. What he is is sweet, charming and charismatic. He's having fun, and if you just let yourself have fun, it's not that bad. A fun line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Fini can water you!" And of course she says, "I won't be the water of Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job as a half-sealed woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: "Life must never be a lifestyle." And there is Eddie Albert who does his usual good job as Finis manager. There are several "self" cameos by real conductors, singers, etc. And it's on-site at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera if you like Pavarotti or if you just let yourself go and enjoy a "little fling" as he suggests in the movie - then enjoy this movie for what it is is. I know I do - EVERY time. :) <br /> <br />
