"Twelve monkeys" have all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An excellent play, a persistent rhythm, wise sometimes ironic dialogues. Besides, he had a good nose about the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first movie in which Bruce Willis is left from the kind of character he used to play in his earlier films. Here was an abandoned and hopeless character that you could call the kitten a prisoner, taken over from a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case in "Die hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of the time. The film also contains a very exciting end. It has a really dramatic power. But this amazing movie is also a reflection on man, the dangers he fears (especially those that can cause the end of the world and here, it is viruses that can cause disease). No matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at their true value: one of the masterpieces made in the 90s.
