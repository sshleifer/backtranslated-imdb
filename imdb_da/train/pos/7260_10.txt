Hi all my names Larissa I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old, so I looked at the matter and it knocked off my socks, I have seen the movie for a long time actually about 30 minutes ago, I just finished to see it . Alisan porter is a really good actor and I love that movie. It's so much fun when she handles the cards. Every time I see that movie at the end of it I cry so I said that I'm only 13 years old, but it's such a moving story, it's really weird that Alisan is 25 years old now. Every time I watch a movie, someone is always young and the movie comes out as a year after they made it, and when you see it and find out how old the movie is, then you can see how They can go from age to next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great, but Daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and I was about 11. So how could he go from 12 to 16 in 4 years and I'm only 13. I'm not sure if he is 16 right now I think he is almost 18, but it is a bit odd when you look at a movie and on the next there about 4 years you saw as they were only 1 last. I'm not sure I have a great imagination and I like to reveal it. I am kind to a computer person but I like to do a lot of kids stuff too. I am very clever as crumpled sued in the movie, but one thing I don't like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes the curly suicide taken away, I would kill that guy if he really did it in it real life . Well, I have to stop writing, I know a writing sometimes, but the kids have a lot in there to come out, and if they don't do children, they will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
