DIG! is fun, fun, fun, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that it was made on such a wonderful budget in 7 years, it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such style and substance. If you are a music fan or a document fan then this is a must see. <br /> <br /> Focusing on Brian Jonestown Over the years Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols are a great way to show the contrast between a decent band that encounters moderate success through endurance and the ability to compromise and a brilliant megalomaniacal lead singer of a varied cast of characters that sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and insanity. If I didn't know that these are real people footage, I would swear it was an incredibly well-written and imaginative scripted piece. The story is convincing, concise and simply amazing.
