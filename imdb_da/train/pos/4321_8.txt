I keep it here briefly. I think this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who have commented that it is poorly written, badly shot, has a horrible soundtrack, and worse that it is not right in the portrayal of life. OK, so it may not be entirely credible for the entire length, but this movie carries a message of hope that some others seemed to have missed. Hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things going on in so many lives. Gangland violence is right, right? Is it right, no! This film carries an important social message, which the cynics may not like, but which must still be praised, rather than weakened. I have seen this movie with pleasure at least eight times, every time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that the world may be better and no more than saving (not before 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 from me for this one. It's almost perfect in my opinion. JMV
