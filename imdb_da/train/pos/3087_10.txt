Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I've seen the whole season online since I just found it and was terribly disappointed that there won't be a season 2: '(and for all, ABC has now taken it offline so it can't be seen online. Why would ABC create a So wonderful show with a great story and with great characters, just to pull it out of the air without ever completing the story. It seems to be our imagination to find out what is happening to all our connected characters. Honestly, though I feel that ABC could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoy it while continuing to overestimate reality reality TV shows, six degrees we will miss you.
