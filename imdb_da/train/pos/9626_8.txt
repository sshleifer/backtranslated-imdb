Warning! Spoilers front! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I've seen movies in German so I might have missed some tracks. <br /> <br /> Despite the weakness of the plot, it's a movie that came through to me. I especially liked Lexa Doig's play. Sometimes I got the impression that she * is * Camille. But I can't stop by wondering what happened at the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I think she, after he was initially put on Bob, eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened to his brother and being forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it is a little strange that she would wear her baby and love it. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I don't like such closures. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts. Well, I've seen him better, but also worse. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is more an analysis of human relationships and reacts in unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, I liked it a lot.
