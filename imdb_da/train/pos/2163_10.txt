I simply love this movie. It is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising stories coming out of Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply horrible Jennifer Lopez. Don't confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted. The Hollywood version is the opposite. I was horrified when I first saw the trailer for the newly created American version, and who was the lead in it. It is typically Hollywood's unoriginal crass commercialism at worst. Remake cement the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason why the original film did not become widespread is the American public's reluctance to subtitle. One of the main reasons why this movie would never work in an American tale is that the reserved, extremely socially conservative nature of the public Japanese persona is disputed in this film. Clearly, the protagonist awakens a fuller understanding of living a lively life through dance, but half of the film's tensions come from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Try to watch this movie in its original form, not the horrible full screen. And please skip the American remake .... it's a low travesty compared to the original Japanese movie. Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older, and it is simply a Japanese tag on history, but the only two people will probably see some time soon, this is the new American remake. <br /> <br /> Talking about foreign films, I make a few quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding- I first list this for a reason, excellent movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-very fun Italian flawed identity flic! 3.Shiri-A Korean Action Pic that mixes both Asian flare and American-style plot 4.Run Lola Run-A German movie that integrates the techno score brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list anyway: -)
