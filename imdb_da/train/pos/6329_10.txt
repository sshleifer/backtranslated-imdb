The cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially trades: it is without any praise. The film, which the book is full of symbols: My favorite is the strongest symbol of Razrukha (common Russian word for "destruction", often means lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 civil war) opened the dirty door in the brick wall snapping in the snow-covered winds and the hole height in the doorway behind it. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie is released on DVD with fully restored image and 5.1 sound, also translated English subtitles, although some obscure words from Sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions of the translation. I do not know that the DVD is available abroad, but if you find it so get it right away, it is really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Finally, a fact: About 50% of Russians today, mostly young people, can be significantly identified as Sharikov's. It's the post-Soviet effect: Soviet people seemed to be completely unprepared for the Western civilization's information campaign, television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and mass media incredibly aggressive, soulless, and thought-provoking so that it set the darkest instincts of any Russian. Even among internet users, every third uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it is incredibly common in conversation languages.
