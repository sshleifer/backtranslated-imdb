Well, this movie is really a difficult one. To be right with you, this movie does not contain much of a gorgeous story, it does not mean that you will "know" how it will end ... but I tell you now ... never have I been so excited and jumped up before in my life! This movie surely provides for jumping and excitement! To be fair I saw it almost at midnight, so I was completely sleepy anyway, so maybe it explains why I was jumping ... or maybe it's because this movie delivers in that aspect! It's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move away and rent a cabin that sees things in the mountains ... everyone looks peaceful and quiet until they have their first visitor (I think it's the main character's sister and she brings with her husband) ... at night the man hears sounds ... check it out, and that is when things start to go really wrong ... they do not go to another day and tell the couple they have to leave because something is not right ... cutting a long story short ... in the end, they find out what has happened in that house over the last couple of years and decide that it should be taken care of. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood blockbuster Nore has a big budget, but please don't let it go. It is scary, excited and very much jumped! Just give it a try :)
