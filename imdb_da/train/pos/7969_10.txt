Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. By the part where the shadow falls into the ditch ... things I cried *, when I was only six, I cried! It takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are well trained. A lovely family movie, * not * to completely cure non-fluffy people or animal hats, but could for soft-as-crap a.k.a. people like me. <br /> <br /> A good movie generally 10/10!
