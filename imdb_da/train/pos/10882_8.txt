This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, it is the movie in a movie that the famous actress runs for her life in the first scene. This movie takes the old convention of a psychic killer on his loose and manages to do something new and interesting with it. It's also always great to see Molly Ringwald back to the attack. <br /> <br /> So this could be an example of what the genre has become. Cut hits all the brands and is actually scary in some parts. I liked what I gave it an eight.
