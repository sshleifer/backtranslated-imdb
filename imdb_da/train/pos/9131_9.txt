"I just wanted to see you laughing in that little rain." This is an excellent movie. It should have been re-rated for PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first movie and greatest. Follow-up sucked. But I haven't seen for years, so here's what I can remember about it. The kid (prince) should juggle over the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), keep his band together (Revolution as himself) and the excitement of his family. But his rival band (time as himself) destroys his life. As Morris (himself) tries to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and if you have, buy it.
