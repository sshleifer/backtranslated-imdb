Much is dated in this episode (like most Twilight Zone episodes), which Women are incredibly sexist military "uniform". And some things are as incredible as the easy availability of clean water. Still, consider the year that was made and the time, and you quickly understand why this episode is as special as you see. It has a good sense of hope, something missing from many Twilight Zones, and an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), something rare on the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a good example of how the Twilight Zone in just over 20 minutes could pack more emotions and drama than most two-hour movies today. And it's great to see two people who became American icons so early in their career.
