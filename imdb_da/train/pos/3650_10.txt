Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I had originally made - and copied over - a VHS tape of this wonderful TV show. I was heartbroken when I realized what I had done since I couldn't get a copy of it anywhere. <br /> <br /> Recently, I subscribed to digital cable, and while I was searching for upcoming movies, I was surprised to find a scheduled movie release. This time I made a copy of it on DVD, so there is no chance to repeat my mistake. I finally got to see it again after eight years, and it was as exciting and exciting as when I first saw it. There is a bit of foreplay for this story because my first contact with "Pandora's Clock" brought a live reading of the book on the public radio. I just happened to go to the TV station on my way home for lunch, and from the first installment I was connected. Every day I waited with expectation that the next chapter was read. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book was to be broadcast on television as a movie, I made sure to clear my schedule for that event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very true to the book, as opposed to what another reviewer had said. It is in itself a rare television movie performance. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about casting. I couldn't imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could be crashed and burnt without a proper cast for this crucial role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame that we haven't seen more of him. In fact, all the cast members did a fantastic job. My only complaint with the movie - and the book - was the interjection of "terrorist plot" to carry a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stem and shoot down the hit plane. Basically, we talk about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and perform a plan like this, and people who are just not realistic at all given all players involved. Also not realistic was how little the aircraft was affected by having the first, then two of its engines were blown. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I enjoyed the building tension and proved to be very credible about how the responses of foreign governments were portrayed in the film as well as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it by all means.
