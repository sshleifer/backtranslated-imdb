Perhaps the best Isabel Allende's book, Spirit of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean story, full of magic, a mysterious veil, and a kind of ubiquitous sadness. This movie brings together a great cast, plus a great artistic direction, with a script that cannot contain all the book's quality. It is unusual for an almost unknown country like Chile to be as well represented as it is in this movie, whose only sin is to target too high, and because of that, illiteracy left a bit disturbed, mostly because they understood a lot little.
