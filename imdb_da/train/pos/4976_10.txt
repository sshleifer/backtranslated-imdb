And Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE film. <br /> <br /> Keeping the blood pumped through our veins is the responsibility of the hard-working HEMO The Magnificent. In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science, along with the famous Hollywood director Frank Capra, were producing a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the universe around them. A long step from the dull black-and-white feed was so often wiped out by young scholars, and the Capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye-catching visual images displayed in Technicolor. The four films - our mr. SUN (1956), the great case of the cosmic rays (1957), HEMO MAGNIFICENT (1957), the Immaculate Goodness (1958) - quickly became schoolhouse favorites where they were infinitely displayed in 16mm format. <br /> <br /> Star in the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), a friendly English professor at the University of Southern California. This afuncular educator turned out to be the perfect film director who conveyed the audience the sometimes complex facts in a way that never made them seem boring or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a Peabody Award for his performance, continued to make high quality instructional films after the Capra Quartet was completed. <br /> <br /> HEMO The Magnificent, produced, written and directed by Capra, relates the history of the human heart and blood circulation system, using animation and gentle humor. Movie star Richard Carlson appears as the fictional writer who energetically helps Dr. Baxter to tell Hemo's story. <br /> <br /> Movie Stomach recognizes Sterling Holloway as part of the television production crew, and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, all unredited. The devoted Scripture, which starts the film, is entirely in line with the production tenor and tone.
