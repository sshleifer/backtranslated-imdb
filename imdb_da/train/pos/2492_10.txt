This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. it is really refreshing to see and i was in stitches many times. I also think there is a social consciousness factor for this, which makes it very interesting. If it were white girls, would they get the same reaction? Maybe they would not they? the characters know no boundaries (see my texts) and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorites are bob builderen one. It's so stupid, it's genius. If you like twisted black comedy then it's for you. if you like to quit appearances, it's probably not. It's such a fun show, and the characters that are resolved on the unsuspecting audience laugh aloud! It would be impossible to keep a straight face to see the crazy signs and reactions of the public! This series easily adds to the excellent comedies produced!
