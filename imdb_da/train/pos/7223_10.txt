The comparison with Sleuth, the former stage feature film, is obvious, and by my first impression, I also thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap certainly has many more repetitions in it than Sleuth. <Br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in Copenhagen at Wal-Mart and found out that it had Caine and the underrated Reeve and was worth 6 bucks. It was one of the finest DVD purchases I could have bought. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best kept secrets that movie buffs are always happy to discover. And it is totally worth repeating the views. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine became bravado performances in Sleuth, I was double impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightly associated with his now legendary depiction of Superman, stole the show in what should have been an Oscar worthy achievement. I've always felt Reeve was a cast actor who didn't get much chance of shining outside the Superman movies and a few other flawed but entertaining movies like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows that his potential was really drained and set to use, thank you tax. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with Michael Caines performance. He was glib, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And seeing him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this movie that I entered a "Michael Caine phase" and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> As far as Deathtrap is concerned, there is enough juicy dialogue in here to fill out its "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue will inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot). It's really hard to talk about the movie without destroying important plot points that are endlessly more fun to discover on their own. Needless to say, it's a must-see. But for me it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase of time. <br /> <br /> Repeat viewing is a must. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to sit next to Sleuth on your DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with this beautifully written quote from the movie: "I wonder if it wouldn't be ... well ... just a little star greeting for me to get into such a risky and exciting collaboration ... where I could not count on any sense of moral obligation ... at all. "
