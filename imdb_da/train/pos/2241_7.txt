Another comedy about a beautiful little country struggling through the jungle of the modern world (for forty) with only native whites and picks to guide them, this is a good entry into the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas slides as usual in the lead when an effortless ministry led to the disaster well when a nation he is supposedly responsible for attracting the world's interest, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead, Peter Sellers puts in one of his quieter ideas a corrupt political and uber-suave John Le Mesurier plays against the type as a robust revolutionary leader. Lots of fun is by all, especially the viewer; Maybe not in the highest echelon of the Ealing classics, but rather loud.
