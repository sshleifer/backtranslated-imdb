I realize many people hate this movie, but I have to admit it is one of my favorites. I think it feels better as it goes on and is happy to like it better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First, I think people never give credit any kind of credit, just like Back to the Future, Time Travel is hard to write, and in this movie they included Time Travel and a spiritual journey. I also feel that Keanu and Alex were out there best performances in this movie, they looked cooler, seemed cooler, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The set design of this movie is also awsome. The sets are quite detailed and massive at times, and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made into a movie about two teenage buds that can hardly spell ... but it is not the brilliance of the whole franchise that makes these two idiots larger than life figures who are responsible for the utopian future of the whole world. The costume design was awsome as well. Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where as in Excellent Adventure they look like they would put it, FAG !!! Although the music in this movie is awsome, the score in particular. There so much I could say about this movie because I love it. But it's one of the movies I grew up with and every time I liked it more, so I can understand why people hate or just think of their Bogus in relation to Outstanding Adventures (which I also love by the way). <br /> <br /> DOWNLOAD WITH YOUR BAD SELF !!!!
