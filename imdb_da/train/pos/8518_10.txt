I ran across this movie on the local video store during their annual pavement. While I scanned thousands of videos and hoped to find a few comic books for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand at work for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a sibling group of three fetuses (and soon to be adopted) children living with my family. Immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children who starred in the film. The film helped them better understand their own relationships. For the first time, the eldest of the sibling group (7 years old / female) decided to open me a little for her past and the trauma she had experienced. She has fought for the whole confidence problem. This is also the first time I've seen his cry. After watching the movie, I asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted. She replied, "It means to be happy." One must look for families who encourage children and are considering adoption. It certainly opens the lines of communication with us.
