I hoped it was good as a fan of Timothy Dalton's James Bond, and even though it wasn't his deserved "3rd Bond Outing," it was a laugh. Belushi brought some good humor to his side, and the dalton hammered it nicely, but was probably underutilized. his part was the desire for a camped-up version of jack nicholson in some good men. the other british in it was a bit shocking, but it was a laugh everywhere.
