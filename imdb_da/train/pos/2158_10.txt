I don't like "grade inflation", but I just had to give it a 10. I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw it last night and woke up today and thought about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake, as someone told me, with J Lo and Richard Gear will be great, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thoughtful to me that I'm hard pressed to think in any way it could be improved or its attitude changed to another culture. <br /> <br /> A story I found worth watching and with fist-fighting scenes or weapons going off or something of that sort! Imagine it! <br /> <br /> All characters seemed well developed ... even non-primary characters had good character development and fun plays, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find good music in our time and age, and maybe it doesn't really qualify (there's lots to learn about dancing but no song), but I really believe that Gene Kelly and others who fought a place of dance in our lives would have thought so much about this movie and the role of dance in helping to tell a story of a middle-aged man successful with a family in Japan looking for something ... he doesn't know exactly what. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the people of Japan who contributed to this movie, thank you for creating and doing so.
