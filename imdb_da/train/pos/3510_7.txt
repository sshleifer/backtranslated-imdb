True fans of movies will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the trolls who consider this movie a star and call it unrealistic. While I do not have the background or come from the protagonist's environment, I have spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feeling that the play was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. I do not know what the basis for others' comments is that the film is "unrealistic". The dialogue is good. <br /> <br /> The low budget production value didn't disturb me a bit. I felt that the natural lighting improved the film's character. The focus was solely on the story line and character development and not glitzy Hollywood propping or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I completely bought into the character's motivations and reactions. The action was credible and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you enjoy good character-driven dramas, then watch it. <br /> <br /> (For the negative commentators, "trolls": click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews.)
