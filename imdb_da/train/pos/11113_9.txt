I've only seen the first series on DVD, but would summarize The Sopranos as a Shakespeare plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (thus not a "10") and far better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is plenty of action, some of it is pretty bloody, the story is character-driven. Even some of the lower case letters contribute to great story lines; eg. the priest's relationship (or lack of) with Carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and Christopher and his dimwit friend (who didn't last very long (a nominated darwin prize?)) Apart from the plot, script and play, the other reasons I liked it ; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. 2. The music 3. It shows that you can literally suffer from mental problems.
