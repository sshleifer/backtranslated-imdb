I've seen this movie many times, and I'll tell you what I've had it every time. This is Belushi's pinnacle movie in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so sympathetic and identifiable with the common man that you can't help but get involved when you start to see. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some were already big, and others were just getting started. It is billed as a good movie, and that is exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you just have to look at things in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you are finished watching, you will appreciate the things you have much more and you will also smile. You can't ask for much more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention it's a funny movie and you'll never lose interest. Very very underrated movie here guys. <br /> <br /> Rated by me: 10 I'm out !!!
