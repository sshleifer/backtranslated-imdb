In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil), Orson Welles gave him the role of a bubbly man. In "The Lady from Shanghai" it is the only time I see him holding the role of the. The guilty role he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I think it is because he was in love with her. That's why it's an interesting movie. But I find the story excellent too. The direction is genius as usual with Welles: Two scenes are particularly brilliant: one in the aquarium and the final with mirrors. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)
