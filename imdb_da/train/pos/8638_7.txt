David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young pair of journalists who want to come to California, but can't really afford to 'ride sharing' with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on spending. The idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way, places where serial killers did their thing when Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with what he says. I don't care about Pitt as a rule, but he does the right to psychological roles. The scary thing is that he does them as well, I actually know people like him before, no, not murderers, but with pretty much the same mindset. At any rate, as the weather goes together, Carrie guesses that the others are out of money, but Earley always seems to come up with cash somehow. .. how he leaves someone dead here and there to do it himself. Lewis does her role we One who she excels at, a non-bright waif who has a good heart, but does not understand that she doesn't have to be beaten by Earley when she does something he doesn't like . As things start to become more unacceptable Carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station, and unfortunately it is at the time when she is in that she sees a news bulletin telling her exactly who they have shared with which things go downhill for them with a quick clip. This is not the biggest flip in the world, but it's not bad ... I looked at what should be the "non-classified" version, but I wonder how much was cut out of the nominal version because It seemed pretty pretty to me, really ... not that it makes it a family price or anything unless it is perhaps the Manson family. 7 out of 10
