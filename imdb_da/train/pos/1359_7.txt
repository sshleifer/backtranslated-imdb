I work in a library and are expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well I liked Parker Posey a lot (she is a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really sweet as his girlfriend (he couldn't act but when you look like him who cares?), But the movie was bad. It wasn't fun or sweet or much of anything. Posey kept the film flowing with his energy. But she taught the Dewey Decimal system OVERNIGHT and then celebrates tons of books for the beat of music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian at the end - hair in a bowl, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let the stereotype go, thank you? Worth seeing for Posey and Townsend, but it's about it. The TV series was much better.
