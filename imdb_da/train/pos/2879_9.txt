Don't worry, Disney fans - this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella doesn't turn into a pumpkin by the midnight strike. One of the most persistent animated movies all the time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the gory Brothers Grimm adventure became a classic in itself, thanks to some memorable tunes (including "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Does" Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo "and the title song) and some endearingly sweet comic relief. The famous slippers (click for bigger picture) We all know the story - the evil masterpiece and the stressers will simply not have it. This gem Cinderella thinks she goes on a ball designed to find the beautiful prince an appropriate girlfriend, but endurance, animal comrades, and a good timed entrance of a fairy godmother make sure things work out, there are a few striking sequences of pure animation - for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles that shoot Through the air - and the design is rich and evocative throughout, it is a simple story padded here comfy with comics, especially Cinderella's rodents (dressed up eye-catchingly as a the famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a miserable cat named Lucifer. There is also much harrumphing and exposition spouting of the King and Grand Duke. It is a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetic-stimulated animated films today, which at the same time makes it quaint and very pleasing.
