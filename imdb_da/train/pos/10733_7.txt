Watching this movie again really raised some good childhood memories. I'm 34 now, haven't seen it since I was 12-14. I had almost forgotten this movie, but when I saw it again recently, some scenes literally brought tears to their eyes! The little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like regaining my childhood. It was an amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this movie for that reason. I hope some of you readers may relate to my experience, not to this movie, but to any movie you haven't seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> - Thank you for reading
