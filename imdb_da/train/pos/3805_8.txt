After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never made it into theaters, so I ordered BluRay. I had a good time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animated movies out there. Of course it has its faults, but I can still recommend it. The animation is well finished, very entertaining and unique, and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end. Some of the backgrounds are just drop-dead beautiful and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought Forest Whitaker's performance feels a little lifeless, but that's how the character Lian-Chu is depicted in this movie. So in general, thumbs, I liked it very much, and I hope it is successful enough for all the studies involved to continue making great movies like this. I would recommend giving it a try and be surprised at how big a movie can be with such a small budget. Hektor alone is worth watching the movie, as some of his moments are Stitch-like hilarious.
