Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their flock from Seattle to Alaska and on to Canada to file a claim. Once there, they have to struggle with seductive, shady businesswoman Ruth Roman and ice-cold, happily fortunate villain James McIntire. <br /> <br /> John Wayne could be talked about more, but his good friend Stewart made some excellent, hard-cut westerns too, some with great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I will take this with the robust action sequences and fine melodrama, across the North to Alaska any day! Far Country has some amazing landscapes and filmography that certainly should have been shot in widescreen. <br /> <br /> There is also strong support from the always reliable Brennan, Roman (which is great), the incredibly sweet Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who play one of my favorite types of bad guy, that kind of does not take too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a big double bill with another highly recommended Mann / Stewart northwest-watched Western Bend of the River.
