* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) decide to go on a rafting trip on the Cahulawassee River before it is flooded. <Br /> <br /> They would have fun having a good weekend in the wild. But when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (Bobby), everything begins to go to Hell in a hand luggage, and this "lovely weekend" will even cost one in four lives ... <br /> < br /> 'Deliverance', which is stupidly named 'Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura' ('A Calm Weekend Of Fear'), is the color of films such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Hills Have Eyes', 'Wrong Turn', 'Last House On The Left' and all the other 'Evil Nature / Revenge' subgenre films, and one of the scary ones, right next to 'The Hills Have Eyes'. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by James Dickey (shown in the movie as Sheriff Bullard), it's a chilling story of how someone can go into a situation, he thinks of everything when he doesn't. <br /> <br /> And the image of the hand of the dead hand that lifts off underwater or the hands holding the gun from one sheet are scary images that will never leave you. <br /> <br /> Release: 9/10.
