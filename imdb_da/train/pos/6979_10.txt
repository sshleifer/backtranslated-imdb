These are real characters and history-driven drama at a level that is ashamed of most of what we see on television at mo. <br /> <br /> I was impressed right from the start. Don't be dismissed if you are not a sci fi nut (like me ...) This could happen on earth, the fact that in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no spaceships or laser guns (No one yet) So far I have looked up to s01 e04, and i am gripped and thinking about what has to happen since there are so many options. <br /> <br /> The cast game plays roles with passion. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show really stands alone, it doesn't matter if you looked at BSG or not, they are actually quite different. I have read some negative reviews from sci-geeks who were expecting less drama and more foreigners and ray guns etc. But I would say ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start to a show. Let's hope they can't do it after 1 or 2 seasons as they usually do with good shows these days.
