A very promising director debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller / who-really-done-it is recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong, well-understood horror story of a devoted but demented man in Thurman, Texas, who continues to become murderous after receiving orders from God to remove demons trying to control humanity. A few plot twists and a spooky finale make for your money's worth. Most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double your stomach. Director Paxton plays the twisted man to be described as the hand of God. Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the old man's demented son, who ends up telling this story to a Dallas FBI Agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspenseful white knuckler! Highly recommended.
