There have been a variety of newer surfing movies that I seem to be running without prior warning. I caught this tax on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could see a movie just about Laird Hamilton - one of this generation's great athletes - so the rest is just sauce. There is plenty of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars, in pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious manner. Of all the surfing movies I've seen, this great wave story tells the best, and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
