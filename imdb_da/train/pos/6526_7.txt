I've always enjoyed watching this when it came on television in prime time every year in the 60s. It's a typical Hollywood story epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but then what, it's an entertaining movie and a great movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of her life is the leading producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law Anthony Quinn, who had Beluche's support role in the '38 movie, is the director of his director's debut and swan song which he had never directed a movie before and would never again. DeMille assembled a crew member who had recently worked with his 10 bids to help Quinn remove it, including the protracted DeMille-associated producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon, who oversees the project. Also from the 10 bids are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, film photographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, nominee directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester as a costume design team, The Buccaneer received only Oscar nomination. A big throw from team DeMille led up by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future president General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast is Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In just over two hours, it draws in some places, but does well with some excellent fighting scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
