Sure this movie isn't historically accurate, but it's great entertainment. The DeMille images, especially the later epics, are slow and plodding, but the action here is moving on a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid to a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur excellent while trying to appease the war-painted natives. This is followed by her, and Cooper is taken to the war camp and tortured. Later comes a long-standing battle with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous, but very fun and entertaining from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses in this era and she shines here.
