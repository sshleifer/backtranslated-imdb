Yes, it will be the full ten stars. It is clear as day that this fullness is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day, and Harris caught him on tape, in all the true misfit glory that you just can't fake. It was too bad a tragedy for the young man, if only an alternative ending could be written for the other person's story. The two other steps in the trilogy tell the story of Sean Penn and Crispin Glover respectively in the young men's roles respectively. The world is expanded, and the inferiority is contextualized by the narrative, giving us a broader insight into growing strange in vanilla America. Recommended to everyone and everyone!
