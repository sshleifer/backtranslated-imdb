From the movie director 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill me again', another film comes in the Noir style. John Dahl created a niche for himself by making films on themes of adultery, extortion in the early 90s. Although I did not have much opinion on the last seduction. But today, Mr Dahl has resorted to controlling television shows. It's a shame when the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is a quite impressive movie that revolves around a drifting Cage coming into Wyoming town for a job. But he doesn't turn out lucky and gets wrong for a Texas proprietor of bar owner J.T Walsh. He gets the job of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split up after taking the prepaid payment without doing so. On his way out of the city, he accidentally hits a guy on the road who he then goes back to the local hospital. At that time, Cage randomly meets Walsh again, which also seems to be the local sheriff. Then Cage comes from his clutches, but enters the real hitman who happens to be Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl has written and directed this film. Therefore, it turns out that a project can prove decent when a director puts his thoughts on the screen. The direction is of a good standard, but while watching the movie I got made for the TV movie feeling. There were too many close-ups. But it does not prevent the film from being an enjoyable experience. The movie had a good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a long duration. <br /> <br /> Cage portrayed the role of a driver realistically, though his performance seemed somewhat detained. His facial expression was on the ground. Lara Flynn Boyle was warm and handled her part perfectly as femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy kneel. Hopper played his part well. But I feel he was displeased with this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hitman. The role was not written and kept his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> As you watch one, you get deja vu from previous movies like 'The Hot Spot' and 'A Perfect Murder'. Due to the fact that some sub-areas are the same. All in all, if you are a fan of noir movies, then this is for you. Worth recommending. 10.7
