I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store far back when. I was always a great weird Al fan and when I saw this video I rented and saw it. I was too young to appreciate Al's subtle humor and satire at that time, but I remember that much later when I was old enough to understand what I was seeing. If you are an "Al" fan, especially of his previous work, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's done in MTV-esque "Rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) tale of how Al was supposed to be in 1985. You'll love it if you like his humorous brand and, more importantly, his music.
