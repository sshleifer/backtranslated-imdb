Of all the versions of Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story) this is, in my opinion, the best of all. Almost true to the original story - with some minor deviations and omissions, for example. The absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that the Eumaeus pig herd recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic plays and authentic landscapes and costumes all contribute to making this a truly memorable masterpiece, not a Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B- flick. Regardless of whether the dialogue and the subtitles are complete in Italian, if you are familiar with the story, he can still make head and tails about what is happening and what the actors say (assuming you have a good handy text from Odyssey at hand). At least I did, and so much so, that it inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more.
