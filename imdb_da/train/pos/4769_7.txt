I'm sure this is a show, no one is so familiar with and may not like it; After all, it's almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the casting, the location, the style of the director and its publicity ?? Show women walking around the beach and all that. No wonder people have misunderstandings and decide not to see them. <br /> <br /> It was wrong for them to do so. Cause after I have decided to watch the show, there are actually more things going on, really juicy history and conflict, proving to be very exciting to see and pretty much? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of the hotel classes, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the troublesome hotel visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel. It is actually more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> <br /> I don't want to deny that the play sucks, but it's not so bad you want to look away. The story is not so consistent but good enough. The sound track fits nicely with the scenario, and the action is all the time. I took a couple of episodes before actually something is going on, so be patient. Recommendation: I really like to see this. The Zillion Times better than expected. Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please review my review after reading it, thank you.
