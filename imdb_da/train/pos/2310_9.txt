I was so surprised at how great the man in the moon really was. I mean, first, I was kind to expect a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided to put it aside when I looked. Well, when it was over, I was just back stunned (mostly in tears), how great The Man in the Moon turned out to be. This movie is so entertaining and so aware of its tone, and it's just a great movie. The action was amazing especially from Reece Witherspoon (who was so sweet and lovable) and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the end a bit predictable, but very well done. Also I felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before, but still a great movie. Overall, I have to say that I don't say too much about this movie, not that it was bad, it's just a movie you either like or dislike. However, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like this type of movie, it is still an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
