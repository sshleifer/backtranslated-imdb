Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is a little weak to put in the mild. She runs an old clunker and rents a small room from a gay couple. But she saves the life of a prominent Arab by taking a ball in the back that was intended for the officer. She charms the national press with her zany remarks and her beautiful looks. Sniffing an opportunity, Presidential helpers get her installed in the protocol department of the US government. Even then she crushes things up sometimes, but she tries hard and learns a lot. She even digs the romantic attention of a Head of Department. But is there yet another creepy plot in the process of involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? A blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie contains Goldie as beautiful as a picture and as stupid "as a fox" as they say. Sunny teaches her a lot around the American government jungle very well. She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol environment. Perhaps the Arab community will be less than enthusiastic about this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent it today.
