I'm glad someone made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for another time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - lovely, fun and it gives you this good feeling about your heart when it ends. The reason may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story, and they have not all been used yet. The cast is perfectly selected, although Scott Wolf does not look like a father of an eight-year-old, not even when he is dressed. So the sparks are in all the right places, support shocks are legal to support, and although you could probably predict the whole movie, you wouldn't want to switch channels. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
