With lots of sunshine, gauzy light and shade that filters through windows and into space, tracking images moving through crowds with handheld cameras, quick editing and extreme close-ups here and there, the photograph is things in this interesting, artistic finish. movie. <br /> <br /> The reason for this movie begins as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest. The movie begins on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of gawking men at the pool, she soon decides to come in to represent France in Miss Europe beauty contest, much to her very jealous-fianc√© (a rather annoying guy really). The stream down the runway shows the ten participants in swimwear while the winner is chosen as the competitor who receives the longest applause (I wondered, could the girls not slow down to extend their time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon chased by a prince and a Maharaja, but her head beau does not like the attention paid to her by other men or her adoring public, for that matter (I think he just wants her in his house, cook Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps improve this movie, but it really is the way it is photographed that kept my interest the most, a little distracting is the odd dubbed sound that is a bit gone. So very clear and full of fine contrast, when I looked at this, I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually, and I found the movie to be excellent, well worth a look.
