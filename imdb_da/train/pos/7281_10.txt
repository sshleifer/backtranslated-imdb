I first saw this movie at a local station on Sunday afternoon's horror show back around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was just a little kid at the time, but I loved it and wasn't really afraid of it. I thought it had such a cool and very original story. Thinking back, I'm still surprised that it was shown during the day at T.V. uncut these years. I've searched this movie since, seen it over and over and always loved it. One would think John Waters would have idolized this movie. It should not just be a scary movie, but also one of the hardest, most dangerous movies ever made. And, surprisingly, you don't hear about this as having the cult subsequently, that a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" has acquired over the years. It has a cult following, but it should really have become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, it came out a bit before Blood Feast came out, making this enough for one of the first true "gore" movies. In fact, this movie features the Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a little Russ Meyer thrown in for good. <br /> <br /> However, I recommend it to anyone who likes trashy, sleazy, black and white horror movies from the early '60s (I think the date at the end of it is read 1960).
