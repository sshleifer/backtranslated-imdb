"Opening Night" released in 1977, trying to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in Gena Rowland's truly amazing performance. Her character of theater actress Myrtle is not necessarily a person we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often uncomfortable, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of the collapse - we are not quite sure whether the demons she is fighting for are genuine or imagined, even though we are being caught in the secret early. Rowlands is, of course, orderly with love from her gifted husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also has a role in the film. This movie is not without errors - it is too long, and the last part of the movie, where Myrtle goes on stage while it is very full, seems almost cruel. The "improvising" part of the dialogue - at least on stage - takes place too long. Some of the supporting characters provide good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, who plays Myrtle's daring producer. Joan Blondell's character has never been fully developed and I could never figure out why she was in the movie except placing Myrtle. Watch this movie for Rowlands alone - she's fascinating all the way through - and it's hard to take her eyes off even if you want to.
