The movie was amazing! I can't get over those songs. I think I'm a little too old for musicals, but that movie deserves some credit here, guys! My special favorite was Jack Wild. Me, as a British actor loves, you can't restrict me from all the beautiful looking fresh men, young men. I never knew when Jack made that movie he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven year old. He's short, it helps. Try sending your answers, contributing posters so I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, the guy Bill Sikes, I think drone look is really familiar. Any idea where he stared in before? If so, send it up, I really want to know.
