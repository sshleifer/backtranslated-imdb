Excellent. Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with emphasis on the woman's role and place. A moving movie, lovingly made, and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; never made any money. Absolutely not the romanticized, unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life.
