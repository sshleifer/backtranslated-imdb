The five deadly venoms are easily the most memorable K.F. Girl from Shaw Brothers' stack (except maybe Master Killer). It has the artists who came to be known as just "The Venoms", some of the best fight choreography ever, and surprising for a Kung Fu movie, a fantastic plot! One of my all-time favorites !!!
