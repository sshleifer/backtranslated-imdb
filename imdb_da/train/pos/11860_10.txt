This movie has it all. It is a classic depiction of the events that referred to the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America. This biographical yet extremely accurate reproduction of Miami's Drug Empire is amazing. Brian DePalma makes a fantastic board that leads this picture so much that the viewer gets involved in both the story and all the characters in the cast. Brian DePalma brings out the raw talent of Steven Bauer (Manny, Tiger's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's Wife). I enjoyed every minute watching this movie and still seeing it on a weekly basis. This year is the 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, I for one is a true believer that for another 20 years, people will still refer to this movie in amazing numbers. With other crime movies being so dramatic I find, this movie is a shock to the system.
