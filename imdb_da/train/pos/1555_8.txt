After seeing the pretty sloppy WW1 spy thriller, Madam Lili (1969) with Julie Andrews on TV this afternoon, I suddenly thought I had seen a much better WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It only took a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doctor. When I recognized the title, the memories came back. It's a reasonably well-crafted story about real events like Kitchener's death and German offenses from 1918. It also has a female spy that is much more credible than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory of the well-produced battle scenes and men and horses was in gas masks. If you are interested in war movies and especially WW1, it is a movie worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
