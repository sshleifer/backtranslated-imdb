Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, the newspaper's agony uncle and dedicated one-to-three girls. At a large family combination, Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in relation to her brother. <br /> <br /> What is a man to do? <br /> <br /> I liked "Dan in real life" but I could imagine that this girl's success or willingness is down to you willing to accept Steve Carell, who plays a role relatively straightforward and detained, instead of going through the broad comedy movements that made him so successful. If you can't accept it, you don't fear "Get Smart" will be together later this year, but for the record I thought he was very good. "Dan In Real Life" starts as your typical, secondly, entertaining, family drama, but it gets more fun and fun as it progresses, and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, movie footage would be very scarce, wouldn't it?), But "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first look with the bright Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many considerations about the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell pushes himself and makes something so interesting again.
