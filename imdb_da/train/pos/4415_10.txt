Although some may call it a "Cuban cinema Paradiso", the movie is closer to a How Green was my valley, a memory movie that provides a lost innocence. The film avoids falling into a political trap for taking pages (pro-Castro? Anti-Castro?), Which focuses on human fragility and the nature of the family. Full of great plays, especially from Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays Keitel's wife A Masterpiece, filled with references to classic films from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS. Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role, which is critical for the dramatic payout of history. TV director Georg Stanford Brown, in rare returns to act (remember THE ROOKIES?), Plays a homeless bum that serves as a Greek choir, excellent. It's a pity that this movie, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, has been released in the US by THINKfilm with the terrible title CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the movie.
