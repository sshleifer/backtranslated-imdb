Not a bad word to say about this movie really. I wasn't initially impressed by it, but it grew fast on me. I like it a lot, and I think it's a shame that many people can't see that it was banned in some areas, mine is one of them. The film delivers in the shock, gore and atmosphere department. The result is a beautiful piece of voltage delivery device. It just seems fair that Chris Young continued to be one of the best composers in the company. The action of this movie is of a somewhat high standard, if a little wood in some spots, and the effects are very real and gritty. All this is great praise for a good slasher movie in my book. I have noticed in some reviews that the movie has gotten serious with the famous killer P.O.V shot. And I ask: What's wrong with that? It's a classic shot that evokes the fear of any good fan of the genre and is great at keeping the killer identity a secret. The only thing that stops this movie from getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist (killer uncovered) is not handled more carefully, I think it just happens quickly, even though the big performances just make it credible. Aside from that, PRANKS is a great movie (although I prefer the original title) and it's a shame that so many people knock it out like just a cheap piece of shit. It is more than that, but few know that what it seems to have been lost in turmoil in the early 80s is slashing. What a shame .... It's a really good movie people! Believe me!
