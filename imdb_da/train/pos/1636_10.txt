This is one of the greatest 80's movies !!! It sticks out like a "turd in a punchbowl" !! I can't believe Mad Magazine condemned it or anything. And yet they have proudly put their name on a show with "Stuart", "I-speak-a-no-Chinese Chinese lady" and "UPS guy on speed". What happens to it? And I love Ron Leibman - he is foxy !! Wonder why he had removed his name from the credits? It was his funniest role I know of. Of course he is not as foxy as he was in Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this movie is right up there with National Lampoon's Vacation. If you liked movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or any of the other 80's teen-focused movies, you'll love this one! Rent it and you will see what I mean !!
