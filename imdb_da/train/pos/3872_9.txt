Once you've seen this little pictorial and comic movie, you'll definitely feel better. Hello to Yves B. Pelletier for having born this little grand movie moment, which I believe will be recognized as a 2004 movie for Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon deliver a touching performance. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you those that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain has given me. So if you like Jean-Pierre Jeetet's great movie, I would like to say that you also want to enjoy the first movie by Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
