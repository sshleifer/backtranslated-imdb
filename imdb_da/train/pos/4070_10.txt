I know Anime. I have been in it long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just so you know I'm not talking about me, let me say this: Out of all the animations I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far the best. It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it is an Acedmy Award; This is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoke and Heavenly Castle to people who had only ever seen spirited away, and they agree that the latter two are the superiors of the three. Personally, I had never thought that everything could be compared to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still believe that the former is the better of the two, but the castle in heaven is easily on par with it; In many ways, the castle has great elements that Mononoke lacked. In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away and think it's Miyazaki's best movie, be prepared to get your soil shaken.
