I went into this movie and thought it would be a crappy b-rated movie. I came out surprised and very amused. Eve was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had fantastic comic timing. The wit in this movie was surprisingly original and really fun with one or two flat jokes in between. The reason was enough to tie it together, a woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman who goes out with her real husband, it sounds removed, but it actually works well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - All in all, it is a worthy cinema watch if it doesn't come on DVD when it comes out.
