.... Actually well done, actually - attacking the evil villains in their lair, stop a little Big Horn style ambush, scared the day via waterboys' bugling, works for me. Stiff Upper British Lip and all that. <br /> <br /> So how does it play on a DVD 66 years later? Beating me like a western, subbing Apaches or Sioux for Thugs, and the American Cavalry for the Imperial British Army. It's very colonial in it's outlook, you know? White man's burden and all that? Kipling would certainly have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play it as broadly as possible and put a friend's friend slapstick into the mix between shooter and brawlings for good measure. (I had no idea that it was Joan Fontaine as the token army wife - did they leave some of her scenes on the rock floor? Very short-) None of them searched for an Oscar here - in fact, Grant was not at his best in a couple scenes - but make sure it still works. And where else would Ben Casey come up as an Indian bugler? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. Check this out if you like adventure and pseudo-western style antics. It was done by a bunch of pros, well I could add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
