Excellent cult film from 1979, when students at Vince Lombardi High School are confronted with a new dictatorial boss named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their violations. Leading the charge against her is fun loving Riff Randell (PJ Soles), the first Ramones fan who wants more than anything to rock the rock band to record their songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is an impossible movie to resist. First and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramone's songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker", and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. Then the cast really gives it all, with Soles an ideal choice for Riff's role; She is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious as Tom and Kate, Woronov is well thrown at the kind of the snooty and slanderous Togar. Clint Howard has one of his best ever share laundry rooms occupying entrepreneur Eaglebauer and New World regulars like Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially fun as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And of course it is a pleasure to see that Ramones plays himself. <br /> <br /> The movie has true spirit. The energy level is high, with contributing author and director Allan Arkush, who brings a lot of flair to the matter. There is also a good sense of humor. The paper plane gag is an excellent example of this. This extends directly to the "wipe" style of scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects that are notable Rob Bottin in one of his earliest recordings. If just as good as an authority-defying, defending-a-real-movie can get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a wonderful cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
