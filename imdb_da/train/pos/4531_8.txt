This is a slit movie with love throughout the ages. The film consists of Keaton, seeking a lady love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he fights Wallace Beery for his lady love. Of the three time periods, I think I liked the Roman best, although I admit it may have been the cheesiest too. I really liked the scenes with the lion, there was of course a guy in a costume and the strange lorry in the snow - but what I really enjoyed most was seeing all of Keaton's amazing acrobatics. But all three time periods were good old-fashioned fun and the movie, but not his best, is still a unique and fun movie. Check it out!
