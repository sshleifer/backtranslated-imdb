Yes, as the other reviewers have already said, this may not be vintage L&H, but it is far from being their worst job as in the 20th century silly ... I mean Fox. This movie certainly has all the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys. But it's their serious approach and determination that makes them fun. They do not play it for laughing like other comedians might, but they take their work and situation quite seriously, and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this movie, they face some basic problems that can really be hit by any of us today, namely job-related stress. Firstly, we would check out a doctor and he would prescribe some needed rest and maybe stay by the sea. This is where surrealism comes into all this. L&H always takes the most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerates it, but never to be incredible, except perhaps for a while. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their self-induced prediction and attempts at extinction. That makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this movie, all these ingredients are presented in a lovely artistic and gracefully slapstick way. Not their best compared to their previous work, probably because this was the real last movie they did for Roach because he wanted to mirror the "big" studios and go into making functions solely and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligation. BIG FAILURE! They should have held together and continued for maybe five years. What the world might have missed in their not considering this as an option. See, laugh and enjoy this as their last great achievement.
