This movie is an extremely fun and hearty story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the instructor goes on vacation, his father enters to step in temporarily to run things. <br /> <br /> This is positively the best work Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the movie of renting children is immediately innovative, and his sales techniques will surely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such a great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you go for some corny pictures with happy endings, go to this one! I could see this again and again and I do it often! My only complaint about this movie is that it's so hard to find a copy.
