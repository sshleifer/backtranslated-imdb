Hi Playmates. I recently watched this movie for the first time ever and it's also my first experience of Arthur Askey, I have to admit that I was very impressed with this movie. As a fan of black and white films in general, passports for pimlico, lavender hill mob and Tommy Trinder (which apparently is a distant family), this film appealed that it provided good old-fashioned British humor. I note that there are some here who have criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion, the time test is a good example of forties comic plays, and if anything adds the picture by creating characters that are more than the only stereotypes that seems to dominate movies now. If you can get this movie, I recommend you get it. Shame these movies are generally not shown on Sunday afternoon anymore. I'm also happy to have had the opportunity to see another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in Father's Army). I thank you
