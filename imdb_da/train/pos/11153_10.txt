Virile, but naive, big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and hustles out to the Big Apple in search of women and big money. In NYC, JB meets frustration, and with "Ratso" Rizzo, a scruffy but cordial con artist. Somehow, this mismatched couple succeeds in surviving each other, which in turn helps both of them to cope with a gritty, sometimes brutally, urban America, heading for an exciting end. <br /> <br /> Both fun and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" rides his head into the whirlwind of cyclonic change of culture and thus confirms 1969 viewers that they themselves have been swept away from the age of innocence and fell into Dorothy and Toto 1960s age of Aquarius. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie is masterful; the casting is perfect; the play is top notch; the script is sharp and convincing; The kinematics are engaging; and the music enhances all of the above. It was deserved the best picture Oscar from 1969, and I would vote it as one of the best films in the cyclone decade.
