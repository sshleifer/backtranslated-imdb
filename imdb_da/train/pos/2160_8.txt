This movie is about a man who has been too trapped by the accepted convention of success, trying to be always upward mobile, working hard so he could be proud to own his own home. He assumes that's all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dance, all he wants to look at a beautiful girl he sees from the dance studio every day while driving on the subway on his way home. <br /> <br /> Initially, he was in love with her to go to the dance class just to release her, but eventually he lets himself go and get in the dance. It is finally seen to him that there is more to life than to work yourself to death. There is a set of oddball characters who also learn in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the rejected ones. There are also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving them a depth by showing their spotty past and their struggle to overcome it. <br /> <br /> The dance was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it's not the usual story where our Underdog comes out on top by winning it. Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption. <br /> <br /> All these make it a moving and fun movie to watch.
