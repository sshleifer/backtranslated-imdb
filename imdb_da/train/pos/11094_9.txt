This slim and gritty movie delivers consistently. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated movies, and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you scratch your head, think "but I loved GET SHORTY", you must be stopped in the face). In my opinion, no "feelings" for Leonard's characters capture better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The move of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) raises the sleaze factor of history to amazing heights. Be a man, get a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films are SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a really special place in my cold movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
