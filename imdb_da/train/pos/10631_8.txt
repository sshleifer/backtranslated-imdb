This movie was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation for us. We actually thought we were the only gay and lesbian couples who had ever married and had children. Of course we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect it and may not want it. But we both chose that love anyway. <br /> <br /> No, it never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of thing is for the Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had issues, but never with the opposite sex. As we age, we stopped with extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not far away. But the suggestion of being heterosexual seems to me rather unrealistic. My wife and I have slept together for the past 40 years. We're still gay. That's the way it is.
