This amazing movie failed to record a higher rating than 5! Why not! It is a great depiction of Christ's life without the ruthless sensationism of Christ's passion. Johnny Cash did great things for God, which is amazingly cut off and neglected in areas where they should be most important, just like our churches. The movie itself took less than a month to film, as Johnny felt God's strong presence that ruled him through it. Big credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie, which will always be appreciated by its fans. At least Billy Graham's crusade rated it strongly enough to use it as a primary source of education for new Christians. Thanks Fox for producing it.As Walk the Line showed that it was freakish that this man survived only produced such an underestimated masterpiece.Movies are not canonized by popular voice as this production turns out! In summary, I think this film is one of the world's great documentaries, as it is fair, honestly portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith!
