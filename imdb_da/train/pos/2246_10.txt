A wonderful surprise for the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great instructor, I don't care about his choices in movies. But this movie was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all ... something I always enjoy! It has not had very good press, and I really do not think it will ever be released on the US market. We will have to satisfy ourselves with the DVD or VHS, though ... I won't say much about the story because I don't want to spoil it for you, but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (as soooooooooo many) before he knows it, he is immersed in a life he did not expect.
