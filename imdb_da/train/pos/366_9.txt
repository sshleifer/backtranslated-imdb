This movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can't decide what was better, the book or the movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is great, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, she could be fun, happy and miserable at the same time. All in all, the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg, and should not go further. 9.10
