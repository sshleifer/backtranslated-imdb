Looking back over the last 28 years (since my first exposure to the show), all I can say is that: Once you've got it, it will stay with you forever. I remember that my first reaction was: 1) annoyingly exaggerated 2) under produced 3) odd characters <br /> <br /> Two years later I saw some episodes again and found it almost not so annoying. A year later, I was able to capture the entire series from the beginning and was quickly immersed in the bittersweet tale of human error and prospects of happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone and I am sure the dated production value would be difficult to handle now. But I still think of the show at least once a month with a vaguely foggy eye that longs for what seemed like simpler times ... <br /> <br /> BTW I'm a married man ... (for everyone who thinks this is a show for women)
