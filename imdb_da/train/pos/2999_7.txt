There were times when this movie seemed to be a lot more complicated than it should be, but I think it's part of its charm. Detective Philo Vance's observation powers seem larger than all the oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes to the final evaluation of how the murders were committed. The killing of the dagger in the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, couldn't anyone just drop it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a line early in the movie about Archer Coes' psychological impossibility to kill himself - I had to think about it for a while. I was left over if there is any scientific basis in fact for the concept to be true, without myself having studied psychology. Seems logical, but then there is always the case that does not fit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know I got a kick out of the agitated coroner (Etienne Girardot) who reminded me of Star Trek's Dr. McCoy the couple of times he said, "I'm a doctor, not a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective". I can see DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying to himself: "I'll use it sometime." <br /> <br /> When the killer's identity is revealed, it doesn't look like such a big surprise, but until then it's really no guess. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film did not respond to the key issue of the title and the murder I was really interested in - killing Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog Ghillie?
