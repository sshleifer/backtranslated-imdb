The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars and not 10 is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) Kelly's love interest leaves much to be desired (IMHO). Love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The Jerry Mouse dance sequence is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter. I'm 28 and she is 4, so while the sign is less iconic than Mickey, he's still a favorite for many kids and adults today. Kelly is as always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen him in, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers in the 20th century. It's no wonder Paula Abdul "sampled" Kelly's moves. I would also like to mention Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you were to see only a part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
