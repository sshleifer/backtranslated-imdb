SPOILERS Many different comedy series have at one time or another experimented with the idea of ​​unclear independence. In an early episode of the cartoon "Family Guy", the Griffin family finds their home an independent country to the United States, and the story progresses from there. Right back in 1949, Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little movie with the same idea. <br /> <br /> After a child's prank, the residents of Pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure. In the investigation, it becomes clear that the small area is a small fate of the far lost state of Burgundy. Withdrawal from London and the rest of Britain experience the residents of the small street the joy and problems of being an independent state. <br /> <br /> Based on a time when rationing was still in operation, this story is nicely told and equally inspiring. With performances by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey, the movie is well-equipped with some of the finest actors in their generation. These actors are also well helped by a super small script with some lines. Feeling remarkably fresh, despite being over 50 years old, the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained. <br /> <br /> Ealing Studios was one of the finest exporters of British film ever existed. With movies like "Passport to Pimlico" it is not difficult to see why. Entertainment from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth seeing.
