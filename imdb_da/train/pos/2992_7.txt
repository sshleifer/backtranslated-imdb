It looks like the director doesn't like this movie, but for me, I think he's a little hard on himself. It's probably not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. <br /> <br /> It is shot in what seems to be a pretty beautiful village that also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies shot in England, give it a ride. <br /> <br /> I just watched a trailer for this director's latest movie 'The Devil's Chair', which looks amazing. There is not enough English horror movie for me, so anyone who follows deserves our attention and this is not as bad as you might think
