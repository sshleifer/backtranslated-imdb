The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, better character development, and the melodies (especially the final song) are both spectacular and warm-hearted. Sure the movie tends to overburden, but come on, it's a Care Bear movie. This film is a good picture to show to children because it emphasizes friendship, love and again, caring. Not to mention Care Bears is just too sweet!
