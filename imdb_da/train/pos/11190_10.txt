One of the best (if not the best) Stephen Kings screenings. Dark as dark can be surprisingly non-hollywood ending, scary atmosphere, great book adaptation, excellent cast, educational (not gaming with the afterlife), in short - all an excellent scare should be ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror movie, just 10+.
