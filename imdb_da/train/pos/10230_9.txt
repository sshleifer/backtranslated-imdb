People forget that there have been more King Kong ripoffs Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all ripoff each other, but YETI stands alone. It only borrows one element from King Kong, and it is the animal's attraction with a woman. The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong), and archaeologists have been fascinated by it at one time, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth seeing. The first time I saw it was at "Elvira's Mistress of the Dark Shows" in the early 1980s. It sent chills down my spine as a child, especially when the YETI became angry. I saw it again, about 1:00 on ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. Seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects (for its time) and the story involves a dumb boy and his dog and an evil businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own use. Also the music is pretty cool, it is very not like. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians create a great monster like atmosphere. Vote 7 and a half out of 10.
