Just the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors as well as the only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-educated group of people's lives, playing on their fragility to gather experience to write a murder mystery book. She plays the female psychopath quite well, while using her abundant sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate Black Widows. Tramway uses for dark places in the community and freely participates in sadomasochistic flings in the "never-before-dark" side of the city. From the beginning, there is nothing less than an R-rating here from the dialogue alone. The stone could also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, an emotional femme deadly without the meal plan.
