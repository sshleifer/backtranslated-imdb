I really enjoyed this movie. Managed to do something that makes movies do now; It provided family values ​​while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is a heroine of all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to. The little girls I was with had enjoyed the movie and talked about Nancy as we left the theater. The movie has relatively few problems for families, and I don't think parents will be bored in the theater. No, it won't win an Oscar, and the exhibited no grand special effects or even a terribly joking mystery, but it entertained me and it was true for the books' spirit. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a young girl (she will love it!) Or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.
