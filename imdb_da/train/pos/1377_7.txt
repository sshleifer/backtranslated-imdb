In the areas where they overlap, this fine film is bright years ahead of 2004's innocence, giving the impression of a rheumatoid and heavy breathing and young girls. Here, the effect is much more realistic and really comes into the head of the three main characters, as they fumble their way through a youth year that breaks with pitfalls. The three main characters, all of whom are unknown to me, provide very safe footholds, the kind that is actually so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other movies, so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could get away from art houses and into the multiplexers, where there is only an outfall, it can 'speak' to the amount of bubbles it is not aimed at.
