PREPARED PLANET is the best SF movie from the SF movie's golden age, and what makes it a great movie is its inferiority. As soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ship's human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes frightening adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - Krell who died overnight. Or did they? <br /> <br /> You can nitpick and say that the planet, of course, is filmed in a movie studio with painted backgrounds, but it adds to a sense of threat to claustraphobia I feel, and Bebe and Louis Barron's electronic music adds even more atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocked by this movie not in the top 250 IMDB movies.
