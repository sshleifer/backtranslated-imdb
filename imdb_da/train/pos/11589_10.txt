Man, I loved this movie! This really takes me back to when I was a kid. These were the days when the teachers still showed classroom movies on real-to-real, and if you were good, they would slow down the movie slowly so you could see it playing backwards. I still remember one of the opening lines .... "Tutazema was his name and he was an orphan, he lived with his sister in the village." This is a great movie for kids and as durable as the red balloon. Finally, the other Indian boys in the village put the feathers to Tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself. He is going to live as he always wanted. He gets to hover the sky.
