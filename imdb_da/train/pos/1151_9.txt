'Soapdish' is one of the best but least well-known comedies from the 1990s. The film is about the various off-camera dramas that appear behind the scenes in a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera. The first of the film's various impressive forces is the amazing A-List cast. 'Soapdish' contains some of the greatest actors and actresses in his era. The film is wonderfully led by Sally Field, as the neurotic aging actress Celeste Talbert (she throws famous tantrum when putting a costume that makes her look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). Her supporting cast reads like a who's who's 90's Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy raise the film a lot. Goldberg is predictably outstanding, while Downey Jr.'s and Hatcher's notions suggest the comedic excellence they would later achieve. <br /> <br /> With regard to writing, the movie is outstanding. There is a really modern edge to the manuscript, which on several occasions right into the wonderful bizarre. There are also several visual gags that are right ahead of their time. In some ways, it reminds Mel Brooks at its best and often reminds of this critic of 'High Angst' (1977). Much of the movie's humor hinges on it's often scathing, but rather accurate, representations of daytime television and neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, The Extras casting session with the executive executive player played by Carrie Fisher is both hilarious and honest. <br /> <br /> For my money, "Soapdish" is one of the best comedies Hollywood produced in the 1990s. It's excellent script and the A-Class cast makes it a must-see. It's hard not to love this movie after it has kept you laughing for 90 minutes.
