Just two comments .... SEVEN years apart? Hardly evidence of the film's relentless traction! As has been mentioned, the low budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. That said, it is not without profit - either as entertainment or as intimidation in itself. True, the plot is at its most basic a reuse of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. More a case of intrigue! Gibney could have gotten a more valuable impression if she had played Halifax - proven a couple of apparently unrelated murders with the "house" as the main suspect. The script is better than average and production is generally of a high standard. It's just not possible to engage the viewer especially at important moments. <br /> <br /> After downloading the DVD for just $ 3.95 last week on my regular video store, I can't bother spending. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just don't expect fireworks!
