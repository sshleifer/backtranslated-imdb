SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attack on WTC.2. French filmmakers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are faced with this event and make the most of it. Before 9/11 Very little happens that gives the film an even more horror as a scenario. On the day of the attack, it seems to be just another dull day at work, but it will soon change. As the filmmakers set off with the firefighters, as he shoots the first crash, this is the only recording of the first impact. He drives the firefighters to the WTC and enters the building. When the other plane crashes, people understand that it is not an accident. In the next period, we see firefighters planning to save as many people as possible in the meantime, we hear banging sounds, that is the sound of people jumping from the tower and falling on the ground. This is the most unpleasant moment in the documentary. As the towers collapse and our French friend runs for his life, you hear him breathe like a madman as he runs out of the building. So a big kind of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black, he was very lucky to survive, and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York. Because this documentary has received so many historical recordings, and because the film should be something completely different, this documentary will probably remain in everyone's memory. I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon, so it makes it even more realistic to see. 10.10
