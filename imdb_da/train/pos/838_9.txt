*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-formulated story and movie together, Brosnan has never been better in a movie role outside his Bond movie. After 2004's "After the Sunset" brings his latest role in grin and a good time. Professional hitman, for example, Julian Noble at a job in Mexico City, wins up to the exact opposite of himself a high-end businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also on business there. The two on-screen duo produce a comically charged, laughing uprising and fail to deliver the laughs. Davis in one of her best roles since "American Splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. One of the year's most enjoyable and best movies. My last rating 9/10
