This is a very dark and exciting horror type thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murder. The story centers on a fake man living in Texas, USA, who suddenly continues to kill with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of bad people. Bill Paxton, who heads this film, plays the horrible father known as the Handcart, while Matthew McConaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film is about Fenton, who decides that he can no longer carry his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hopefully tell the story to the FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can't believe of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish, and this is certainly one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to because of the glorious power of this movie. The directors have filmed this film very well and they help put the plot through the good landscape. The action in this movie is good, but if there is any disadvantage, some parts are very powerful and can interfere with some people. <br /> <br /> While the concept of this movie is very dark, the little ones help portray the idea through brilliant plays. This is really a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat all the way through. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
