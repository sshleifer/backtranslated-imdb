I have to say despite it's reviews Angels in Outfield were a pretty good movie. I like the facts, how it teaches children to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen. Unlike the other baseball films, this one movie appeared because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, it had some flaws like some irrelevance (ie towards the end, when Ray Mitchell hits a homer, he doesn't go on the plate and therefore it wouldn't be a score. But it's just nitpicking. ) I have to say I was really impressed with the film's presence and morality: Just have faith, don't give up.
