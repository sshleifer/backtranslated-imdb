The secret rage, in many ways, a romantic thrill drama (directed by Mel Ferrer) boasts the top heads of Colbert and Ryan; It remains rude if it is not entirely poignant until it is at the end when the dishonesty conquers the lifting of unbelief - as it often does in this genre. But for some viewers, the film's highlight will be the depiction of blowsy Leah by Vivian Vance - the immortal Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy." Strangely, Vance had very few film roles; her true home was Broadway, where she (among others gigs) stressed for Ethel Merman. Here, with a winning trip as a maid, she contributes to playing a minor role in a disgraceful scheme; see her half-heartedly bending the smoke as she pushes a furtive cigarette into the hotel's linen storage room - a violation that she ultimately pays the highest penalty.
