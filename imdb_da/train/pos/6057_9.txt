Well, because it's super pictures and great sound, it's a great home theater "show off" disc, but it's also a touching drama and an informative documentary. The parallel stories intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young, old, boys and girls alike will find it deep, we are all fans of the car, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and endurance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder soundtracks are perfectly matched with the images and content. I don't want to finish, but the final run order of Quincy Jones' "Days Like These" can only bring a tear to the eye. Enjoy it!
