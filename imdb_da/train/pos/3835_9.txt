This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. The bizarre story, the dark decors, the swarming insect everywhere, the idea jumps and the surreal dreams ... Really amazing! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this amazing. It looks a bit like the movies from David Lynch: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. Rather, it is a series of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. That is a disadvantage. If the movie had a really fascinating plot filled with excitement with a captivating denouement, I would give it a 10 out of 10. But it is missing and therefore I gave the movie a 8. Nuit Noire is a movie worth seeing. Search the DVD and you will be rewarded!
