Having seen a lot of Greek movies, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after seeing this, I felt astonished. The films are great without a big attempt. You cannot claim that the manuscript is so large or the photograph is perfect or something technical. It is a real story and it happens in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The movie is like a blow in the stomach, and I really wish things were not like this. Of course, it is about the Greek people's xenophobia (ignorance) to something else. The problem with this guy is not that he is a former convicted. The problem is that he is not one of those people. He's different and they don't want them (that's why all the good things he's doing are boomerang to him). And also talk about people's apathy, because there are some people who are against the king's hunt, but they dare not say their opinion. In the end, you can clearly see that the hypocrisy of society is religious and tries to act as God says, but at the same time unfairly acts for the King. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system. In the end, you can get a positive lesson from this very bad story, meaning you can only understand and be part of this community if you want to become one of them. If you want to remain different and even alone, you are lost (and it is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is genuine and it must be a bell for everyone. No comment on the main actor because he has already received a prize and I think his game was amazing. Little commentary on Hatzisavvas (playing the policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he has played many roles, and I'm sure this role for him was very easy, but he plays so well that you can't deny him a big bravo. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a good Greek movie.
