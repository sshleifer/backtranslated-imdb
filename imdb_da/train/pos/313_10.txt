I'm black American and I loved this soap opera. I saw it being called in Spanish at Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a true story of a black slave who is a love affair with a white commander, led to her leadership and honest, moody way of life. Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing and saw her options. Many would argue that she was selling herself - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children. It was such an excellent soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it is not released. This soap opera was the best soap opera ever. We need it to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. It plays at Azteca America right now, which is only available in Mexico or in the US with paid cable. We need it released again to Telemundo.
