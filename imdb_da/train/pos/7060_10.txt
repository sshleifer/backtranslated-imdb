Many people have commented that this movie was not nearly as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not - for you. But how does your child react to it? Well, my loved it more than first. <br /> <br /> Past Disney movies can sometimes be a little tough for young children. (For example - Bambi's mother gets shot.) This movie was really good for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to be sneaky about what should be Disney's standards based on past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a cute little girl or soft-hearted little boy, you really want to buy this movie and treat your young children. This movie is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I love a movie that looks forward to my child and does not have to impress the parents all the time.
