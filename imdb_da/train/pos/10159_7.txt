There are few movies or movies I consider favorites over the years. The gospel was one of them. I saw this as a young teenager and wanted to have the opportunity to see it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blonde, <br /> <br /> 2 / Last supper was a big meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he liked to play with the kids, <br /> <br /> 4 / his death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> The movie may not have been theological sound or high quality, but it touched my heart at that time. Besides, I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture. If it ever comes out on DVD, I will buy it exclusively for sentimental reasons.
