As a habit I always like to read through the "hated it" reviews of a given movie. especially one that I would like to comment on. and it's not so much a point-counterpoint sorta deal; I can only see what people say on the flipside. <br /> <br /> But I'd like to correct one thing. many people who hated it called it to rewrite, "beautiful but superficial", some even go so far as to say that the norm's desire that it was not possible to help his brother was at best a worldly plot. <br /> <br /> I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction, I can relate. daily you see them abusing themselves, because only because their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifications of what they did then; how or why paul decided to record games and associate with dubious people; It's really more how they are connected. on the one hand, they are genuine geniuses, and on the other hand, it is painfully self-destructive (it is much like people like Howard Hughes? The same forces that drive them are the same forces that tear them apart) and all the time You see that you know here, and what's worse, you realize you can't do a horrible thing about it. <br /> <br /> For the Norman Maclean, a river runs through it was yet another way to find out why the tragedy might occur and who was to blame. In the end, nobody is and often there is no reason. But it takes a lot of personal fear to really come to this realization. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes at all.
