This movie has some of the greatest comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever gathered in a movie! The reason is missing something, but the lovely quips are enough to make the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages who are sure to please. As a cinematic art form, it is very entertaining; and with big stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Comedic dialogue and timeing like this has long been underestimated, and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this movie: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite these star talent and physical comedy, the movie dragged and received poor reviews and commentary comments. Achieving a true comedian dialogue is an art.
