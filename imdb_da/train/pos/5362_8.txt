RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, it's not 2001, but it's not supposed to be. And the play and the script here are not even as high as other Arnie films like PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I submit that the IDEA behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. A state sponsored game show where criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with none) to satisfy the public's desire for sport and blood. The ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. Or the rules require. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such over-the-top gory death scenes and cheesy one-liners, it really has a lot to say. Someone else has pointed out all comments about culture / government presented in this movie, so I will not go into this. Suffice it to say that if you look beyond the seemingly stupid feeling of the movie, you'll enjoy it a lot (especially if you're a great SF fan with a lot of imagination). As I said, it is not trying to be a serious art movie, but it is surprisingly layered to an 80's shoot-up flick. The premise is borrowed from a Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King) short novel, but differs relatively strongly from his source material, especially towards the end. (The book ends quite nihilistically; it is superfluous to say that this film does not.) I enjoyed both, but I like the movie better. My favorite line: "Guess it's caused by steroids."
