This movie is one of my favorite. It is difficult to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his awkward pairing with the boldness of Cheryl Pollak, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. Also, some of the characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in themselves. Finally, the story is one that always draws on my heart strokes, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a tough, sentimental girl tonight.
