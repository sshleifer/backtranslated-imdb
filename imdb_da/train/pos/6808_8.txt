1967 in cold blood was perhaps more like "the right thing" (think about it: would we really see the right thing?), But it was black and white in a color life and many people did not even know what it was and There was an opportunity to resume it on television. Plus, if you replay it, you can show some things that aren't appearing in the original. The book in Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the first "nonfiction novel". Truman's book was actually not 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian location was adequate for Kansas basically for a television movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: Dick's womanizing, Perry is an aspirin junkie, Perry plays blues guitar.
