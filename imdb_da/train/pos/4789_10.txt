David Lynch's (1999) movie by John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin for some time well before any movie release. <br /> <br /> We come into Alvin Straight's (Richard Farnsworth) life late in life. His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him, and he knows it. <br /> <br /> This makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at each point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put some things straight. <br /> <br /> At this point in time, Alvin is a man of great experience but modest in money. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) is struggling with a speech disorder that makes communication a big effort on behalf of the audience. But it's worth it because Roses story can't help but get out when the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is the story of a journey. But as everyone travels, it is a journey in a geographical sense and in a human sense. First, in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey that no older gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably do. <br /> <br /> But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many skills that equip him to achieve his unlikely goals. His goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and will probably die and he will visit him. He has hit him many years ago and they have not spoken for a very long time. <br /> <br /> In the long run, Alvin encounters many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from knowing him is the essence of this movie. We will know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the movie, we know who we are .. better.
