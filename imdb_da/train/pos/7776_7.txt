Does anyone know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack could have been a Masseratti. Rock Hudson's character told his father that he took a job in Iraq, isn't it timely? I have had Dorthy Malone in my span bank most of my life, maybe it was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall probably had some chops in this movie and probably out-of-the-way Malone, but Malone's part made a more sensational impact, so she got the Oscar for the best supporting role. When is Loren's role considered a leading role? Old man Hadley's character was probably quite a common picture of tycoons in his era because he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry, but in building an entire city he had forgotten his children to get his wife to bring them up. At the time when he was a widow, he realized that they were all he really had, and they were spoiled and looked for attention, so rather than trying to relate to his children, he blew his head away. An old moral story. But what were the sports cars serious about?
