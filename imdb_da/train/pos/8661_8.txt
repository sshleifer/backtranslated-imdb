I have had a large number of criminal intentions in law and order. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective is quite tough and seems a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent Series. See the other side of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the amazing soft side of these talented actresses and if you are a Criminal Intent fan, this movie is a blessing in her acting and you get a beautiful darn good yarn of family difficulties in the south. I didn't like Albert Finney's role in this movie because he made such a convincing spectacle of the older southern guy who is hard on the road and intolerant and unacceptable to change. He reminds me of so many men from my youth, and the depiction is divine, but you will probably find him hard to suffer in this movie. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is easy to suffer from this movie and why I recommend it as a 10 star for Criminal Intent, Law and Order fans.
