The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least an Alan Quartermain TYPE character) that the '85 director made the mistake of looting the IJ movies for dialogue and history too deeply. What you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name Alan Quartermain, in a bumpy hodge podge of a cheap imitation IJ saga (with a dash of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It was the mark of many critics to have been a "big parody" or "accidental comedy." The word is unintentional. This movie was never meant to be humorous; Witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it is unclear rather than witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series you get much more history, character development of your lead, solid portraits and a nice, smooth entertaining mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deserved, so this version carries a real story and not just action and Eye Candy. Although it includes both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the 1985 version error by forgetting the IJ all together and returning to the source material for AQ, providing a fine, well-thought-out plot and some good sub-plots complements. <br /> <br /> Now, this experiment is not the all-out action extravaganza that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a small attempt to be like that. This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful representation of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on the spot in South Africa, the audience gets beautiful (if desolate) views, SA aboriginal cultures and some fine wildlife footage to blend smoothly with performances and history here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this one, as I have never been one to subscribe to his vision. In fact, I have not had most of his work as director until this attempt. I hope this is more a new range of talent and less fluke that it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version is a 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
