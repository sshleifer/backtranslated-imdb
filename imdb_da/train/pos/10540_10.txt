I can only agree with taximeters that this is a great movie and should be viewed by a wide audience. The imagination of the display, the visual interpretation of the script, humor is constantly surprising. The two leaders are great and really carry the movie. My advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the movie and look without expectations. I rented from blockbuster so it is easily accessible in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion and it is always good unless it is just 'it was stupid'. I loved this movie, you just won't see pearl like this every day. This should be a cult favorite. Try it, you just have to feel the same as what I do.
