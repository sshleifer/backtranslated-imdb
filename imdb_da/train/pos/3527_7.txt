Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mystery woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. She accepts, on condition that they do not exchange information about each other - not even names. Sometimes it's the best kind of dates. But when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team await him. Scott's wife has been murdered. His alibi is a mystery woman, but no one can remember seeing her and as a result Scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and finds out to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and the viewer is 100% behind the assassination attempt by the Chancellor. We follow her through some memorable scenes, such as her performance of the Mac bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic venue where Cliff drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) takes her to hang out, drink and dance while he is picking up with his friends . This is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a pronounced part of the film, as all sweat intensively and rhythmically throughout the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the female lead, and Thomas Gomez makes a sympathetic policeman. Alan Curtis started well as the confused, innocent man, but when he was arrested, his performance took a left turn when he became thoroughly uncomfortable for Kansas for no reason. God knows why she's stuck with him. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't keep you guessing who the killer is as we know halfway through the movie, but it doesn't matter. In fact, it adds to the excitement and dramatic evolution of history as we want Kansas to discover what's going on and then to get hell out! It's a great movie with some amazing scenes, but even though Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I just never like him in anything I see him in .... someone handles a necklace .....
