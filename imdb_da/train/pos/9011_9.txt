I found this movie by accident, but I'm happy about it. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry combined into a much more enjoyable movie. This movie catered to the excellent films Branagh made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star will be here as disabled young women who seek to complete, as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead for a long time. To exhibit a disability is hard to pull off, but essentially only her eyes to show her pain in her life situation, she made it so credible. If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women "pampering" themselves for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I was sure Carter would have had a strong thought for an Oscar. If you run over this movie on cable late at night as I did, trust me it's worth losing sleep.
