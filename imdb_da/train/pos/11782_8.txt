I do not know if this contains any spoilers or not, but I do not risk being blacklisted until the year 3462. I totally disagree with the viewer's views which have described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo -marxistisk. " They may not have seen the same series as * I * did. <br /> <br /> The Series * I * watched, depicting the history of European colonization in America and South Africa without any particular inaccuracies. I didn't see anything in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people, who happened to be fortunate, though Europeans often * were * lucky - and there is nothing wrong with luck. Nor did I see native people portrayed as bad little innocent things. If anything, Inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect a leader to be in connection with aliens if his country has not been captured in living memory by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly didn't think of anything that could be interpreted as Marxist or Neo-Marxist except for the most incredibly elastic fantasies. <br /> <br /> In addition, many African people * have built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. By the time they were at the height of their successes, Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations * were as advanced as others in the world - and so wealthy; sometimes more. Aboriginal American and Khoi-San populations * were * decimated by cups and other diseases introduced by Europeans; Just as European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from any other African people in the south of the Sahara.) <br /> <br /> So I can't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything I didn't know when I was finished with seventh grade. There really is nothing new in the way of historical information in this movie. However, it presents some fine dramatizations of events such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values ​​are very high; and it fills a few holes here and there which was not covered by Mrs Gruber's class class for six hours of community studies at Milan Middle School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, provided you had a decent primary and / or secondary school, you will not learn anything new, but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reading what you already have have learned (or should have learned) when you come to high school.
