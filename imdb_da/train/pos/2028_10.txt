Burlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie with Dennehy. Although it is believed to be only about love, it really goes deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this film and places it among the best I have ever seen. The horse scene is amazing !! Any horse lovers out there will love this movie! <br /> <br />
