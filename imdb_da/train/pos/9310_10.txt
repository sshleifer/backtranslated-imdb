wow, how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? It was definitely the highlight of my year - no - my life. As if raptor graphics were not amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the movie, although the background did not actually match the scene's setting. Wow, which genius. And while the movie is full of plot holes (for example, a couple of clips of a t-Rex-type animal where a raptor must be and a central moment when Pappy finds a torture chamber, "Colin's girl shouts!" And runs out) I will never forget the brilliance that is Raptor Planet. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
