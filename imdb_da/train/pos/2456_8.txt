When I went to see this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I would see a boring teen-flick, but actually the plot is interesting and well done, the play was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville, who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a wider audience than it has received. It is a film that can be seen by the whole family - perhaps not the smallest of the children, as it contains some rather rough scenes. A movie about love and the problems that may arise when you go against your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is much like "Bend it as Beckham," but I actually think this movie pulls it better.
