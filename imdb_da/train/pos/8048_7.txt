COME ON!!! They did it on purpose !! Two of my current faves on television (Meloni from "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel from "West Wing") are connected to a nice little sleeping / character study. Plot is nothing fancy, but the play is right on the mark. Tim Busfield shows for some nice bits. Worth a visit.
