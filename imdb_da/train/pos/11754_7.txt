Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos, but comes out a little shrinking. Donald Moffat is for one note as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is excellent, but as a quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are amazing who carry the movie through most of his rough spots. It takes time, but is a little more than that.
