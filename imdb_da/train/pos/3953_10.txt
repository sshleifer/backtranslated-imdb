I watched this movie on TV when it came out and never seen it again. For the life of me, I couldn't remember the title and stumbled across it while controlling Roy Thinses movie credits. Excellent, dark and eerie TV screaming movie in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Don't be afraid of the darkness"; and "Satan's School of Girls," all lost satanic classics. I also think it has many parallels with Clint Eastwood's "High Plains Drifter" classic. Why don't they solve these big little movies, especially when considering all the newer waste that fills discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these flicks have a cult follow, so sales should not be a problem.
