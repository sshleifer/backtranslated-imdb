There are few really hilarious films about science fiction, but this one will beat your sox off. The driver Martian's Jack Nicholson start is side split. The reason has a very smart twist that is seen to be enjoyed. This is a movie with heart and excellent plays by everyone. Make some popcorn and have a good evening.
