I am of "Christopher Reeve Generation", it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman yet, but it does not prevent me from enjoying other actors in the role and George Reeves makes a good bid to knock Chris off the top, even if he just barely falls. It doesn't stop me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot to do for it. It has everything a movie needs, a plot with the beginning, middle and end, and all those parts are intelligently written. The film is angular both in acting and history, something a movie noir but with tights. The story is both exciting and meaningful, it is a movie with a message that is not too predictive. I'm still amazed that this was shot in 12 days, o Hollywood's glory days as we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into hell ... The movie is polished and professionally made, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for managing with both speed and efficiency. It never lets technology limitations drop it. In fact, some creative things have been created to create the effect of flight, including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we see it from Superman's point of view. also a few close-ups of George in process work, and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves TV series. A DVD that is worth owning in its own right, the inclusion of the movie as the original whole, is ice cream on the cake. Give blood today, God bless!
