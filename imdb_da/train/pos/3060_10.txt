It's always sad when "fringe" movies like this are overlooked by the majority of movie players. "Panic" is a wonderfully convincing and exciting study of a character that feels trapped endlessly in his own life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as compelling as ever. This fine actor seems to have a special talent to draw on your heartbeat, no matter how wrong his characters may be; we cannot always reject the lifestyles of the main characters he plays, but the feelings of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often far too painfully confidential. The title "Panic" initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of obvious feeling. At one point, Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. But as this story unfolds, it becomes increasingly apparent that rage and desperation, not indifference, are the driving force behind this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once, I was reminded of his performance in "Fargo" another highly rated movie. In both "Fargo" and "Panic" we experience a middle-aged man who somehow seems to have been out of sync with the rest of his life. He has lost his way, and the only way back in fraud seems to be about darkness. He knows he's making bad choices, but desperation overrides self-control and common sense. Alex connects with Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (mesmerizing the game of Neve Campbell), which he meets in a doctor's office. Thematically, this union is less coincidence, more work of destiny. Alex finds some consolation with Sarah, and may feel that she is a co-driver as he, someone who has lost his way and flies effortlessly throughout the rest of his life and waits effortlessly for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Selecting movies like this is a sharp and convincing way for Neve Campbell to respond to the critics asking her plays. All too often, it is the characters she has played, who is the weakness, and offers Campbell no depth to bend his acting muscles. However, this performance may be an eye-opener for many. In a perfect movie world there would not only be more films like "Panic", but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you see movies for the richness and depth of characterization, then just for you, "Panic" is unacceptable, rather than just the latest state-of-the-art special effects. A +.
