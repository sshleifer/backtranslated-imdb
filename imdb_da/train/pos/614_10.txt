What a wonderful, imaginative movie "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I could easily finish it with one statement and say enough to take it as a very strong recommendation to see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and continues down our throats, "Stardust" makes us remember why we're going to the cinema at first - escaping the reality of a couple of hours and examine other lives, other times or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us in all three places without problems and with a childlike joy that we all long for. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts, and scoundrels. It has the girl in need, the hero, the bad guys, the obstacles, the spells, the antidotes, the charms and even the hint of lightness to make it quasi modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from the city of Wall, conveniently located next to a wall that separates their city from a magical kingdom. The only way past the wall is through a breech carefully guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by David Kelly). One day, a young man from the wall Ben Barnes reminds the old guard and escapes through the breech. He happens at an enchanting kingdom called Stormhold, where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is held captive by a witch and twisted by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is gone, Una Ben seduces and sends him on the road. Ben returns to the wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he is summoned to the bridge, where the old guard handles him what to expect - a baby boy. The boy named Tristan grows up to be a rather rude young man (Charlie Cox) who is infected with a girl out of her league and also engaged to another. Nevertheless, the young lady (named Victoria and played Sienna Miller) once goes with Tristain, and he admits his love for her. After seeing a falling star, she tells him he can get her if he picks up the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and sets out on his quest, which takes him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the Stormhold kingdom, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who will succeed him to the throne. His sons names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other sons where the other brothers killed in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> In any case, he throws his ruby ​​charm to heaven and Voila, bringing the star to the ground. The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes), and of course she wears the charm. But little does she know that she is now being persuaded by Tristain, Princes and also an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut the star's heart to regain her own youth. Complicated? Yes. But everything comes as the adventure unfolds. Tristain is the first to find Yvaine, but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria that he does not recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. His original interest lies only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must get past the princes and Lamia first. The princes are not so big a problem as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and like in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets the witch who relaxed her mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to a tee. He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave the audience on the floor with laughter. Although his role is small in length, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed Yvaine. She makes a perfect girl. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of life as the fighting princes as they die back as ghosts ala "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> In addition, director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other direct experience was "Made Cake", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be too complex for young children, but everyone over the age of 13 would like to watch this movie several times. It's so good. "Stardust" is what movies should be. Perfectly written, perfectly thrown, perfectly aligned and perfectly acted. In other words ... perfect.
