It's something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup d'etat and a few Irish documentaries are right inside it. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is falsified by the private media openly as a dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. without repercussions from government side (such as silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they still claim they are suppressed of course. See how the media are glowing about their own role in the compartment of television after they overthrow the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get?). <br /> <br /> And see how Venezuela's people are marching to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands and reinstalling their elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood adventure, but it happened to the US explicit wishes. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the center of action, acute and utterly embarrassing to the main supporters of the coup: The good, democratic, liberal-minded, benevolent United States (still channeling large amounts of money to Chavez's political opponents). <br /> <br /> Also very entertaining and exciting. 10 points.
