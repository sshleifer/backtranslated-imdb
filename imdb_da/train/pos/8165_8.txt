The dentist was made at the time when almost every profession had a psycho. We had crazy police officers, ambulance men, secretery's and it was just for starters. The dentist came surprisingly late because dentists are usually everymors nightmare. <br /> <br /> The reason is twisted. Super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives perfect life in his big "white house", he has a beautiful blonde wife and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds come to their horizons in the form of an unpleasant IRS guy (Terminator's Earl Boen), dirty pool cleaners "clean" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to have gone through a dark filter. He goes nutso and begins to take care of the people's teeth in the unpleasant way. And you won't get to his way. <br /> <br /> Crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He instructed the successor to Re-Animator and his first film Society was a good spinoff from John Carpenter's The Live. Film producer Pierre David is known from movies as Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I could recently dream him as a psychotandist. He was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person. Linda Hoffman was beutiful and stupid as Feinstone's wife. Micahel Stadvec didn't have many lines, but after I saw him with ladies in the neighborhood, I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was a good sight as a policeman on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teen who is about to become the next client of Feinstone. Final warning: If you are like me and have problems with the dentist then you may have to skip this one. But if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and many unpleasant drills.
