One of the last classics in the French new wave. In the direction of the cinnamon Jean Eustache took the simplicity of the cinema of the early century; for history, Eustache took on things in his own complicated love life. So many things can be said about this movie - observationsly brilliant; even indulgent overlap; occasionally hilarious; emotional drainage ... etc .. In my thoughts, regardless of complaints that can be smoothed against this film, its many forces can easily be overshadowed. Any movie student, author, or simply someone who is willing to handle a 3-hour movie without sudden cuts, no music video overflow, no soap opera-like plotting, and no banal dialogue should make it a point to watch this movie . Everything is to admire: the scripture (concise, clever, surprisingly fun), performance (all are simply perfect in their respective roles), and the simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer in the movie) makes this movie unforgettable. This is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
