This is a very funny and sometimes rather eerie anthology that if it is a little short in the screen section, it is more than the lack of play, location work and overall overdraft. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot, who plays a horror writer stalked by a sign from his novel in the works (a perfect example of the actor pulling this out of the only pedestrian); The third, with Christopher Lee as a man, frightened by his own daughter and the last episode of the late Big Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror movie star that gets more than just a new role on his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired, and of course it looks forward to the opportunity to really hammer it up! Cushing is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly is not helped by the fact that women's wax factor he is obsessed with at the local wax museum is anything but "beautiful" as we are told she is! Someone of shocking beauty was needed, and instead we get a woman with a jaw of a turtle. Smaller quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can.
