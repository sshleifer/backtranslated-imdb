Richard Linklater's beautifully crafted mix of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's best-thinking people's romantic films. Julie Delpy turns to one of the decades most engaging performances as the Parisian lass, spending a day with strangers on Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there are oodles of it) is sometimes wobbly and too expensive, but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers who create a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection to each other is filled with wonderfully entertaining, touching and insightful moments.
