[WARNING: NO SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uncomfortable. She came to mind when I reflected on the audience's reaction to "The Mother." <br /> <br /> People gasped when May (Anne Reid) argued passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later sexually explicit drawings in May. I doubt the audience was horrified at the nudity or the contents of the drawings as much as feeling uneasy about seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex. Writer Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundry" Sun Fanatic ") again shows why he is among the most trenchant storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic, his story is not easy to take. This dramatic family drama is not a movie you can claim you have to look at because it is raw, complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the great thing is Kureishi and Roger Michell (who instructed "Notting Hill" of all things) create an unsentimental, frightening and beautifully portrayed portrait of an elderly woman who, after all, realizes these years can and should still enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a wonderful epiphanous moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be hard, may shoot back: " Why not? "<br /> <br /> Why not, in fact. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination in turn in May, subtly, detained, heavy and sad, often all See Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate link in a pub. Or when she asks Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all the anxiety and despair of corn. In the film's most devastating moment, May fall to the knees in front of Darren, willing to do anything for him, just ask him to be kind. This is an extremely gutsy performance of a remarkable actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Michell's use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots first arrived at Bobby's place. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the flamboyant way in which their own family welcomes them. <br /> <br /> This movie, at times reminding me of the honor and raciality of Mike Leigh's work, except "The Mor" depends on a small sense of optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My one stranglehold: Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers remain out of focus, while a white curtain in the foreground gently flatters in the breeze. And the only sound is in May in the death of passion. The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely surround Darren's role, plow their way so fearlessly into these roles that it is unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. Especially since Michell has no problems making later sex scenes visceral. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't have very sympathetic characters. We sympathize with May, but she also causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt that Kureishi intended to people his story of sympathetic folk. His point I think was to mask a family that is already breaking when something emotionally disastrous happens. It is unclear in its desire and ultimately unforgettable.
