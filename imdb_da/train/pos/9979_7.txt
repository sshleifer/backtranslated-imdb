To begin with, as this movie is a remake of a classic, the rate must already be lowered. As this version stars Viggo Mortensen in Kowalski's main role it helps. <br /> <br /> It's not like the US government is terrorizing one of its own citizens. Sounds like jason priestley character from the movie! But it is the truth that the government would do everything to destroy a human's life in an attempt to return to his wife. A wife who doesn't have it in work and maybe doesn't. <br /> <br /> "There was time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the disc jockey. <br /> <br /> There were some great pictures of the scene in this movie, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this movie a 7.
