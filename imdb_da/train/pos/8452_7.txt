Exaggerated mobile suits that can wipe out whole armies - Check! Weapons that should hardly be aimed at and still wipe out everything - Check! Mobile suits based on angels - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This one, the Gundam Wing, has good character development, the complexity of reality, interesting ideas and some beautiful eye-candy. <br /> <br /> With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (though still absolutely obsessed with Heero Yuy, the main protagonist of the series). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcher, is becoming more and more human while still in character. And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre's Zechs Marquise) flows between OZ, freelance and the White Fang command shows how some people can really lose their own creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works. In 49 half-hour episodes, however, it becomes a bit of responsibility because this complexity is not used to its full potential. The ideas in the core of the series - the need to fight, the desire for peace, etc. - are those that resonate even today. Eventually, the series was before its time, what about the "war on terrorism" and all. But its exploration of these ideas is the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, an incredibly dramatic piece that makes up some of the best scriptures in the series. <br /> <br /> However, it is sometimes good writing sometimes sometimes extremely poor, which dramatically makes it lose some of its edge. <br /> <br /> Regarding the eye-like, which is what this has in bucketloads, everything from the cellphone fits the battleship Libra (No not tampons you idiot!) are wells designed, and explode into large apple balls (which is bad because better animation would have had better explosions). But who cares ?! Stuff explodes, and that's all that matters. <br /> In short, the pure complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you have missed a lot. The bad writing can leave you calling, and sometimes the animation makes you go "WTF?!?!" But it's done in its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration, as expected of such Japanese animations.
