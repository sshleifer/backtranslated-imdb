Will all of you please put the hell out of Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you're bringing! The guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free! Sure the play is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, the makeup is not the greatest you will ever see. But it's also not the worst, if you want to see it, you should see Zombie Nation with it's washbenzombier. This is clean, good old-fashioned guerilla movie-making! Todd is a complete professional and a good guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The reason seems to have been downloaded. But what in hell do I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and doing the remake of this as he was supposed to. If anyone has ever tried to make a movie, they know it's just completing it, a performance in itself.
