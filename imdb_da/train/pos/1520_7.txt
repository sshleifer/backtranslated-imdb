Four stories written by Robert Bloch about different people living in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first is Denholm Elliott as novelist who sees the killer he writes about coming to life. Some creepy moments and twisted end were good. Second, Peter Cushing is obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee, who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. It all leads to a rather scary ending (though the end in history was much worse). The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing nature) and a cloak that makes people vampires! There is also a sweet line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good horror anthology - nothing scary, but the first and the end of the third gave me some pleasant little chills. Also the fourth is actually a lot of fun and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! The house itself looks beautiful ... and very scary. It is orderly with some nice atmospheric details. A very good and unusual movie score too. All in all, a good little horror rhetoric is well worth finding out. Try to watch it on DVD - Lions Gate One looks great with strong colors and good sound.
