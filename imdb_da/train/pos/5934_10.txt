Sorry to say, I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way, Hollywood I think they can cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please do not entertain us what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I look around to see when it came out. It was like a terribly practical joke. The graphics of how good the story seemed to be solid, and it had all the captives of a fantastic movie. Unfortunately, this will not happen at the moment. To the producers, directors and all the actors good jobs, but I hate you to do it to me. You left me and wanted more.
