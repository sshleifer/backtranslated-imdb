Sensitive film lacks gloss and to some extent narrative structure, yet it is excellent shot and done. But the narrative structure is debatable. While it gives the impression of binding loosely ends in the final scenes and links its thoughts to what can be described by the modern viewer as a "story," I am skeptical of whether this feels * needed * a "narrative structure" that is clear and detectable. Inevitably, it will be compared to SOMERAULT, because its central protagonist (I'm not sure it's the right word!) Is a young and very youthful woman whose newly discovered sexuality confuses and strengthens her - of course, of course, Cate Shortland's film tackles this aspect better. But while it is possible for ruthless viewers to dismiss this movie as a clich√©, PEACHES is in some ways very ambitious than SOMERAULT. Maybe this is where it doesn't quite do it. It is certainly very different from Monahan's first move - INTERVIEWEN! I'm not quite sure how sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added the story. Who knows - maybe they did. They certainly hit home the compromised and defective character of Weaving's character - though I personally think this was accomplished without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** SEE THE MOVIE AGAIN ***** **** <br /> On another view I can see how some would reject it as a telemovie dressed up as a function. But I am not sure how separate these "categories" are anymore, or even if we should make this distinction. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from the Hallmark effort. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal, and its content is hardly challenging, at least in the way SOMERAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, ILLUSTRATED FAMILY DOCUMENT, LOOK BOTH WAYS, and THE PEOPLE TOUCH are. The performances are all good, but I came to the realization that the main reason I enjoyed the movie was to fit the "Australian" genre without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be a pretty good one reason for another person * NOT * to like it! In fact, it was only until Lung enters the living room of his Vietnamese dress that the movie really starts packing a blow. But it leads us to another debate - * should we expect a movie to challenge us all the time? I definitely enjoy being challenged by a movie (or a book or other people), but is there no more room for what is simply a good story? <br /> <br /> I haven't deleted my first post on this movie because I'm too aware of the Orwellian overtones of such action. But I would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to maybe a 6.5. <br /> <br /> Regarding the nomination for AFI Best Film, my voices go to MAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK Both ways should win.
