A fantasy is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / Director Jones does not waste time looking at the viewer with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob cries with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while a meter girl places a ticket on your windshield will just cry. We all wanted to tear a terrible toupee out of a man's head. These are just excerpts from what's in store when you see "Cross Eyed", a heart film that should be a stepping stone for Jones and his scary sense of humor both in front of and behind the camera.
