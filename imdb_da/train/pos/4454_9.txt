Virgil Manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farm. After hearing his beloved cat one morning in the woods around his property, Manoven is delighted with what looks like the murder of a small child in the middle of the forest. He reports the crime to the police, but there is no body to find. Needed to disturb visions, he further investigates and ultimately is directed to a creepy orphanage where events take a supernatural trip. "Soft for Digging" is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of spooky atmosphere to save. This minimalist movie is almost completely devoid of dialogue. Such scenes are really nightmares and the play is excellent. The placement sets provide lots of creepy: the creepy Maryland Woods rivals used in "The Blair Witch Project". Give this strange horror movie a chance.9 out of 10.
