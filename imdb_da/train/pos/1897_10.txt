Again, it seems completely illogical, to me at least that "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece here is the "unlikely" if not quite "impossible" message of wildly diverse elements. That he managed to make alcoholism play friendly rather than being silly tragic in itself is wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore its finest role and any other film element in it seems the optimum effect, including the point, to be patented and egregious. I challenge anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh aloud. But apparently, almost a third of the audience has succeeded. Well, for one, Gordon's efforts found and found both ridiculous and gracious, and in fact, by Geraldine Fitzgerald's aunt and Stephen Elliot's murderous wild-father-in-law absolute gems of background people. Even the black driver managed to escape the patronage, and the late sneaky Sir John Gielgud was entitled to accept his fee, but wrongly performing his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Underztand", much less rationalize, "the scourge of alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not spirits, it is other drugs chosen, including meth and addiction are only symptoms, not targets) simply observing its own quizzical way.
