This movie is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought Wendigo legend was pretty cool. The action was also great, as well as costumes, production, photography, directing and scripting. <br /> <br /> A very happy family, on vacation, is stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. A hunter then appears and is very angry and furious about the fact that one of the deer is broken. He then begins to pursue the family and strange things begin to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It is worth it. Kudos to the cast, the crew and the filmmakers. To Thumbs Way Up!
