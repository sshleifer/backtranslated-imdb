Fidois a very strange movie. And in many ways, a really good one. My first thought after viewing was how the hell should they market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story mixed with the 50s nostalgia comedy with zombies. Do not stick completely out of the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has suffered from Shaun's carnage, gore and belly. It is a completely different animal (forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido starts with a black and white information film explaining the back story - people have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that suppresses the meat eggs in stupid servants. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought we were in for a fifty-year war war paranoid parody a la Matin√©e, but we were soon struck into a world of bright primary colors and the fifties middle-class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who doesn't fit into school. His mother is a social climber, and his father is nervous and detached. <br /> <br /> Seeking to follow Joneses, mother (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is uninterested at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon shows a good friend to Jimmy. Until his collar flashes ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie is to find out what it is. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor is of the light family variety, and sometimes the line is too big depending on the boy and his dog / family moments. But the film has been shot through with wonderfully dark, really fun moments, which welcome, will ensure an R-rating for what is a family comedy for extended periods. <br /> <br /> The movie looks beautiful and is wonderfully done by everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Despite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie will find a niche, as it is a very small gem in this year's movie shit.
