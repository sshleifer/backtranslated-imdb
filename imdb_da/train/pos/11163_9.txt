I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true champion in the cinematic form, his movie is sometimes overlooked. But this movie is a favorite for me because it really gives you the feeling of the time the movie was put in. All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the dress form, the way they spoke, OK, they could be exaggerated, But it is good to know that there was an opportunity when two men tried to exaggerate each other with insane stunts. <br /> <br /> I just felt it was part of the story that had to be somhced by many people and appreciated because of this fact. Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I've only seen it on TV. But for anyone who wants a piece of life movie about that period, it's the perfect one.
