Yes this movie is predictable and absolutely not assigned material. But then it doesn't try to be something, it's not. A fun filled drum with real fun single-liners, a stellar and very fun performance by Peter O'Toole, a grounding and groundbreaking feature by Joan Plowright. The band's performance was on the spot, each playing their role in a skilled, comical way. The music was good but not great, but filled the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments, I deduced that the subtlety of something of humor went over their heads. A good example is the commentary on the "strange baseball-like game", well my dear American, it was cricket - from which baseball is derived - and the explanation of it to the ignorant American band was very fun for those who know cricket. Also no, you should not twist as Carl broke a window; it was fun how Lord Foxley said "oh yeah!" to get more money for the break and the manager at the same time "oh no" and also refer to the money. Jeez, it seems that any joke should be explained to some people ... All in all I enjoyed it and had some good laughs! Worth to see.
