I read somewhere (in a right panning review) that this is something of a live action mecha anime and I think they are on the right lines. I first looked at this movie when I was very young, and I've been dying to see it again, and when I finally made it all, all the memories came back. I don't think it should be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of good old 80s almost TV movie fun (it's set against a rather dark future, though this point isn't stressed too much). What I most admired about this movie was that the dialogue doesn't sound generic - no cliches, no predictable lines - all in all just fun! Perhaps the time has not been good for this little movie, but I can still understand it in me. It is by no means perfect, but it is entertaining and does not attempt to be anything but that. Let the geeks and the comics worry about technical aspects - who cares? See it yourself and make your own decision. No one else's opinion matters.
