This work is a bold look into the mindset of men who are in wheelchairs. This movie never tries to tone it down, cotton-like or soft soap anxiety, confusion and pain from what these guys live with. That's its strength, I think. <br /> <br /> But then the performance is fantastic, with well-developed and delivered dialogue that draws you in and makes you feel part of the experience. The characters never try to block the audience from knowing what's in their brain - what's in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it plodding, but fun. <br /> <br /> It bets a 6.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
