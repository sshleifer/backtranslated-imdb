I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the beginning. It's wonderfully thought out, and Bryan Fuller has the most notable ideas for this show. It's amazing how much TV has needed a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It is a great relief to see a show that is in contrast to the rest, where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities and it will be boring at the moment to see Show close to identity. With a grand cast, wonderful script and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is far from being one of the most notable shows on your television.
