Okay, so maybe it's not the award-winning "movie of the year" type movie (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think won a few prizes), but it's a great movie about 'The Kid' (Prince / O ( choose) and the events around him living in Minneapolis play his music. The music is amazing, in my opinion, you own this soundtrack, it really is a classic and buzzing in the eighties sounds and feels in a wonderful fashion. The movie itself plays out a good plot, it is worth watching over and over again, especially if you like Prince / O (as I do) of course.
