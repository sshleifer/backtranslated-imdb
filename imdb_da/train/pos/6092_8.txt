Cult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who could guess that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A Space Oddysey, movies crawled by critics and audiences on their release would be immensely popular? Like many IMDBs, I consider myself a movie expert. Unlike most of those who hated Envy (turned out by a gloomy 4.4 rating), I found Envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade. The movie's plot is ridiculous. The dialogue is not clever, the scenes have little continuity, and the script looks like it was written by a fourth degree. But that's why the movie is so much fun. You see, to appreciate the unfortunate genius of Envy, enjoy the movie from an ironic standpoint. Why do I love Envy? Because the film is bad to the point that it gets good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy certainly fits the bill.
