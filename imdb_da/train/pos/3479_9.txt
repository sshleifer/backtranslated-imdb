This show started with great mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show began to play short episodes of Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo. I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 minute episodes to short episodes. Some of the voters became inaccessible. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became inaccessible. I think Velma's voice changed after the first 12 episodes because the first voice actress who played Velma was not available. And the network ordered the Hanna Barbera studio to make more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. Then they had to make several shorts. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. Still, it's a good show.
