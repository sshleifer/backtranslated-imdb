Some years ago I bought several $ 1 DVDs that contained two movies each. One of them had three Broadway Girls (an alternative title to the Greeks had a word for them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It is basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and relates to erroneous identity involving one of the dancers driving a millionaire limousine trip. Vera-Ellen is the dancer and wow, which legs! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a chance for her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she is dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is the rich guy who, when looking for Vera-Ellen, fails for a reporter to interview her but is hit by Romero. What I have just mentioned may be confusing, but (mostly) makes sense if you are willing to check your brain while watching this fun scrubbing comedy with amazing songs performed by the exquisite wife Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a little hectic here, but Niven gets hilariously confused everywhere. The phrase I saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it is publicly available. And Vera-Ellen does well with her lines, as she is not an actress. So on that note I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie buffs who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
