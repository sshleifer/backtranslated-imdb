Fascinating downer about a wild male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled king. Extremely bleak study of today's moral and social decline, highly ordered by John Schlesinger (who never topped his work here) and superbly acted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. The packages are quite punch overall, but the "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played on a chuckle - are mildly intrusive as it is "against" the drug party. The relationship between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are cautious not to be mushy, and it gives the picture an edge that may not have been with a smaller director than Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969 and the winner of The Best Picture Oscar; writer Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 from ****
