Surprisingly good. The play was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was cheesie fun, the plot was stupendously fun. This was a fun movie to watch and give your brain some rest. Parts of the plot and quotes showed me to be very creative. 7 out of 10. In fact, for what it was, it would deserve a 10 out of 10. Don't compare this with an arthouse movie or a bloody slasher movie.
