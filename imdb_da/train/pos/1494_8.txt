A stylish offer from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('The Far Pavillions' etc.) Become a classic, intelligent "four-hand" with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) All provide stylish performances, despite a low budget, resulting in a few "un-special effects". The most outstanding contribution, however, is the 7-year-old Chloe Franks who are chilling effectively against her part, making the blood cold. Only spoiled by the shabby title desired on the film by its distributors, this is the underrated release, a slice of the 'blood' n 'guts' choker movie that is starting to be for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.
