In what is undoubtedly the best outdoor adventure movie all the time, four city guys confront the wrath of nature, in a story of survival. The setting is backwoods Georgia, with its forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> Director John Boorman chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals involve the film with a depth characterization that is unmatched in film history. No central casting "actors" could ever get close to these people's remarkable faces, voices or actions. I can't remember a movie where secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else, this cruel realism makes this movie so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another strength is the movie's theme. Nature in nature can be violent. How appropriate that the setting should be the American South. Very few places in the United States are or have been as violent as redneck countries. In a story about the feline's Darwinian survival, the film generates the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a very product of its time, as unlike today, Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. The film's magnificent nature, sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and ripples of the rivers, combined with lack of civilization, gives everyone an environmental message. And that's another strength in the movie. <br /> <br /> At entertainment level, the voltage gradually escalates as the plot continues. Not even halfway into the movie, the excitement becomes extreme, and it never lets up, not until the final credits roll. Very few films can maintain the level of intensity over such a long plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's technical quality is topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the play is amazing. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Down Beatty is the perfect cast and does a good job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the movie, it is the music that hits me as a jerk. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Deliverance" will almost certainly appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventures. Even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the play and the plot tension are enough to see this movie, one of the finest in movie history.
