Mario Lanza, of course, is "The Great Caruso" in this 1951 movie starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a very fictionalized biography of the legendary world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today. <br /> <br /> The film is lavishly produced and the music is brilliant and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom and other opera stars that appeared in the movie. If you are a purist, you can see that people on the scene smiling under the Sextet from "Lucia" beat you so strangely - even though Caruso's wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. It is also very unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role was too high for him. <br /> <br /> By taking a dramatic license, the manuscript leaves some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas today in the standard repertoire, but it's never mentioned in the movie. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "The Golden West Girl". There is a famous picture of him who poses with a sheet wrapped around him as a toga. The reason for that image? His only shirt was in the sink. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and collaborated with Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He sang Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake. <br /> <br /> Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a show of Martha, which has never happened. He had bleeding under "L'Elisir d'amore" at Met and could not finish the performance; he sang only three times at Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role on Measure was not Radames in Aida, as stated in the film, but the Duke of Rigoletto. So when it's on the screen "suggested by Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband," that was what it was - suggested. It is true that Dorothy's father proclaimed her after her marriage and left her $ 1 of her massive property. They also had a daughter Gloria together (who died at age 79 on 10/7/2007). However, Caruso had four other children of a mistress before he married Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Lanza's voice is remarkable as Caruso's, but just listen to Caruso's singing in the movie "Match Point" - Caruso's voice is remarkably unlike Lanza's. In fact, from his sound, he wished Caruso could have sung like a baritone. He is thought to have had some problems with high tones, further evidence of baritone leanings; And the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role that Lanza absolutely wasn't. Lanza's voice didn't deserve to be compared to another. He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operative music. He sings the music in "The Great Caruso" with a robust energy; He really is here on top of what would be a short career. His plays are natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself. <br /> <br /> Really a movie for opera lovers and Lanza fans who are probably the same.
