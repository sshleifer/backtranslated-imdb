I must say I had wanted to watch this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. The action of Dominic Monaghan is simply amazing. As some insomniac myself, I can relate to how the story develops. I have never experienced any of these, but some daring moments overlap dormant and it can be scary. It was a good movie, worth every penny. I hope someday I can work with Tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it to anyone. Maybe not young children as they can be scared. But if you are an insomniac like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You will love it. <br /> <br /> F.
