Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a little more. I can't remember a Pixar animation, except for the two Toy Story movies that I laughed so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. Voice overs is what makes this movie. Dave Foley is a serious swamp that does a lot of trouble. Hopper is an excellent characterization of the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on again. The script is amazing, so fun and sometimes even touching. It lacks Antz's social messages, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 10.9. Bethany Cox
