This is one of the better comedies ever on television. Season one was fun as was most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate last season. The only good part of the last season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut people's imagination, often showing the characters in famous TV shows or 70's movies. It's a rare show because I liked any character (except for the last season ... too late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't that fun). Red foot in your ass comments never became old, not even Kelso's stupidity. Bravo to fox to keep a good show for so long, too long.
