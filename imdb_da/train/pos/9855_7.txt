This is my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Normally, the appearance of other animated movies made me look rickety. Not ice age. I wanted to see it when I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was the occasional fun and general fun movie to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby set 20,000 years earlier. Visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create persuasive anomaly, it's another thing entirely to create visually arresting things and ice age is great to look at with its stylized images. Blue Sky Studios is a company to look for in the future.
