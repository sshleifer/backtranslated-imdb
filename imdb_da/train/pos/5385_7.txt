I have never seen the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until I read the other comments here, I didn't know that this movie was the "prize" of that competition. I was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself looking, daring eagerly all the way to the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has been made (The Dangerous Game, etc.), but I had hoped and almost received the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist would eventually hit the hunter. I think the high technology was overdone (GPS) and gave me cold sweat flashbacks of Night Rider, but it was too exaggerated. The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) required by the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lift countless fuel grenades on a public bridge, and NO COPS turns out to investigate? Could a limousine make countless donuts in a Las Vegas cross and NO COPS show up? Pleeease. Too much of that kind of thing - fun to watch, but at least keep it plausible, thank you. The last solution was good, but the end was disappointing with the fainting of a bad Star Trek episode. In any case, I understand why the play was so cheesy - except Zane, who doesn't approach as much work as he deserves IMHO - they were winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Knock me out.
