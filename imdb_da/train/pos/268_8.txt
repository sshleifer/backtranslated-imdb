I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is it spelled right?) In Cybil. Have not seen her for a while and forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a good job in this. The support molding was also quite good. At some angles, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The abductor was pretty scary, and the story generally had some good terms. The young girlfriend was a hottie. I thought the man certainly had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and love these movies. Hold my interest and I see it again when they revive it. Can anyone else recommend similar movies for this? You can write on the table or send me a private email if you want. Thanks in advance. Aboutagirly.
