I thought the movie "I Don't Do They" was amazing. Previously, I have seen Rob Estes at "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett at "Melrose Place" and loved to see them again in "I Don't Do It". They have good chemistry together (I think being married in real life helps it!) - In the movie, they are both widows with children and careers, and they fall in love and try to mix their already busy chaotic families together without losing the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they keep it together, which is about working and educating a family. So many people have talked about this movie - all good! - and the movie left us who wanted more. This would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so nice to see a real life down to earth, family show like this, depicting the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "reality TV" that all the stations overwhelmed us with these days. Someone tells the people at ABC Family, they have the start of a new series here!
