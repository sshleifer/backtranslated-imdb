I question anyone saying they don't care about this movie. Some reviewers have said that it didn't have enough action, some said it was too long etc. Don't listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> The imagined performances are amazing! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an admarible job and is a very impressive character because of his size. Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. It's onw of the few movies I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that were pretty much flawless from casting, steering, writing, acting, etc. !!! I was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 films reviewed. I felt so passionate about having just registered with IMDB so I could let everyone know the right scoop. I've seen this movie about 10 times (every time with another person) and everyone has loved it! You must be awake and be aware of the first 30 minutes because they introduce a few characters at the beginning. If you have the attention longer than most of these juvenile kids write reviews for the movies on this page than you would love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix of # 32?!?! It should show you the age group of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is a top 50 movie !!!
