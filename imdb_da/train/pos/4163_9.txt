I saw this as a child at the end of the eighties, and I have to say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that has long been in the imagination. If you have never understood anime anime, discovering this movie can be your golden ticket to Otaku City. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The cell animation has a traditional style, which explosively depicts Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is one of the unique children's films such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz, which completely exceeds the "family entertainment" status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms. I highly recommend this movie.
