I loved this movie. It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider's movie. This one stone, not as big as Sissi, but still stone! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said French dubbing. Now it is originally a German film, not French. So yes. Second, there was a plot, perhaps you did not know the story. Oh and her mother played that part of her governess, not her teacher. And the story wasn't actually Cinderella but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway .... yes the story in this movie is amazing, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all the historical stuff. Like the guy who tried to manipulate his mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband, he showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. When rolling was new, it was considered a little scandalous because the couples dance so closely. Yes, her governor was like oh my god! <br /> <br /> I also love the clothes. The styles are good, hoop skirts are awesome. And of course Romy always looks very pretty.
