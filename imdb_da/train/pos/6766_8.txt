Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent curly film films Otto Premingsers 'Where the pavements end' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg ... <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the honest , hard New York policeman who is always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he abhor bad guys ... When he hits someone, his bones hurt ... And the man he wants hitting is a smooth crook (Gary Merrill) pointing to the title. "Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?" he asks Andrews. "I have as much right on the sidewalk as you do." <br /> <br /> Dana Andrew's occupation and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is a thief's son ... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice was pampered in private vendetta ... <br/> <br /> With an ironic twist of the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once again, and Andrews now seems to play the same detective some years later, but no longer the romantic, knocked down by his work, by the cheap villains ... This time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect ... The killing is unintentional, the victim is worthless, but it is a crime he knows can break him or send him to jail ... <br /> <br /> Using his knowledge of the police procedure, he covers his part in the crime, plants false tracks and tries implying a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case itself ... The dual excitement of fo To ease the big case through to its conclusion without engaging in the murder, is beautifully maintained, and the final solution is both logical, satisfying and by no means a compromise ... The film is one of the best detective films from the 50s with curious moral values, also one of the prime's best ... Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique that performs pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre to externally exert his tension in realism ...
