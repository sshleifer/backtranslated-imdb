Bette Midler shows her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I'm thrilled that I've lost it and I can see when I want to. She holds what is required to keep an audience in captivity. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was her singing "Stay With Me" from her 1979 movie "The Rose". You can feel the feelings of the song and will end up having goose bids. The show will leave you the urge to go out and either rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
