If you haven't already seen this movie by Mary-Kate and Ashley, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for!?" This is another great and wonderful movie of the twins who we all know and love so much! It is fun, romantic, exciting and absolute breath (natural). Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the most important scenery here anyway! Would anyone true fan have it in any other way? Of course not! Nevertheless; It's a good movie in every sense of the word, so if you haven't already seen it then you just have to! I mean right now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
