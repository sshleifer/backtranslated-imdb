I just watched this movie, I saw it only when I was 7 and could almost remember the end. so I saw it as 10 minutes ago and (I can seem like a baby when I'm 12 ha-ha) I started crying at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was mostly sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you Charlie" and also, "I miss you Charlie", just made me cry ha-ha. It must be one of my favorite movies from all the time, it's just a movie worth watching. See it haha, that's all I can say XD <br /> but I love this movie, it's a true classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
