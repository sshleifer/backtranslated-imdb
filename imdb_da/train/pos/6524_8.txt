<br /> <br /> If you are at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / early 19th century American History, or Yul Brynner, you can watch this movie for yourself and make your own mind about it. Don't be discouraged by various unclear reviews. My reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well-acted (mostly), has a very witty dialogue, and that does an excellent job of portraying the charming, appeal and legendary fascination of the private Jean Lafitte. Although not all of the events in the movie are historically correct (can you show me historical films that succeed in this?), I think the film is exactly in its treatment of the role that Lafitte played in New Orleans' history, and hate affair between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this ban, which was one of the city's favorite sons. Don't worry about what the movie does, but watch it for what it does, ie. to study one of New Orleans' and America's most fascinating historical characters.
