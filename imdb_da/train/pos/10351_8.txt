When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees that her baby is being pulled out of their tent with a dingo and then a trial that no one should experience. For it seems that the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a circus. Lindy does not help, because she does not want to play for the jury or courtroom, she is only herself and she is a tough nut to crack, so of course everyone thinks she is guilty because there is evidence that is not come to light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a seventh-day Adventist pastor who doubts his beliefs and perhaps his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the United States because the Australian public does not believe in history, and the media only support the flames. Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for hard work, but years later, a lack of evidence shows herself and she is liberated, but only after the family's life is essentially destroyed. A heartbreaking story, very well done, a bit long but worth seeing. 8 out of 10
