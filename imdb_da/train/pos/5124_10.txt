This is a fantastic movie that I don't think, gets enough credit like Saturday Night Fever or Fat in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but is too pig on the way to admit her feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bullfighting because he believes it will show his crew. Although it was made in 1980, it is still in time today. The great country music soundtrack is amazing. 10.10
