One of the most timely and exciting documentaries you'll ever see. While history takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it gives an intimate insight into the political dynamics that prevail throughout the Western Hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the story of "US-backed Latin American coup", this movie crowns in real-time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, politically savvy, and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insight that this movie provides is invaluable. You get clear examples of private media, as a formidable force for massages and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas struggling with the brutal realities of "American politics". You get a clear sense of impending judgment if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny that has been abrupt and illegal, imposed upon them by the conspirators. We also see arrogance and fascism, CIA-backed private media, plutocrats and generals who have collaborated to bring Venezuela back in Washington's dominance. Even though President Hugo Chavez is headed at all, Caraca's people are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forced to be kidnapped by dismissed generals. Their answer is the highlight of the movie. If you are looking for an excellent portrait of what the American government, Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela are all about, this movie is it!
