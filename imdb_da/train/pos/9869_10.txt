I have to say this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it by other view, a few weeks ago. I can see why the successor does so good business at the ticket office. Apparently, many people seemed to like this movie. A beautiful color palette (man, it looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor makes it a great winner. The open 3-4-minute scene with "Scat" is excellent, which is subsequently interlaced with him. "Sid" sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, gives the most important humor in the movie. He usually has something fun to say throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great character of the movie, literally, while Denis Leary is the horrible bad guy sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and beautiful colors but a good, sentimental story of how a little baby softens a few hard characters. This is not interrupted with many songs, either: a short card and nothing abusive, linguistically. <br /> <br /> If more animated movies were so good, I would own more.
