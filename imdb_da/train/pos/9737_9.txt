Great performance from Simon Pegg, who just gets better and better with every role. As usual, he plays a part of a very cringy character, which makes you want to hide behind your pillow in embarrassment for him sometimes, but that's what Pegg is all about. <br /> <br /> The laughter was regular and eyelid and all of them aimed at Penn. The film was very cleverly composed, with each person playing a very sophisticated and serious role with Penn being the only humor involved, which is a great credit for the director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can't let this go without a quick applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone all the way through. Highly recommended for everyone.
