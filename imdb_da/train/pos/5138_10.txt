Back in 1994 I had a really long holiday around the fourth of July - something like 17 days in a row, what about two weeks paid holidays, weekends and the holiday itself. I was in town during that time and hung a lot on my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I didn't have a television in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' pipes. I just finished watching a segment of X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was immediately connected. I had always been fascinated with things in our home that had come from my parents' home and through the inheritance of relative property and often speculated on their history, value, etc. After my long vacation I used to go to my people's house on my lunchtime just to catch Personal FX. I remember an episode where co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment where the series was filmed was refurbished and once said renovations were complete, that Personl FX would return to the air. <br /> <br /> It never did! Personal FX was the first and best of the collective shows. And it disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later I am still sore. <br /> <br /> Way to go, FX.
