George Lopez is a fun man even without sitcom. The first episodes I saw of this made too many jokes at the expense of his mother. As I have seen this more, there has been more and more variation. No one on cast is really sure from his wit now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this season has come to light that George is becoming more comfortable with the sitcom Dad family role. At first he was not, but he is getting more and more in a groove. This makes both him and the shows progressively more fun. They had added a few signs that George could also play this year. His wife's father is becoming more and more involved in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there but not as central as previous seasons. I think it's wise to say with George's sense of comic timing, and ABC's lack of good sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
