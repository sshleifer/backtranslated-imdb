This movie has it all. Aim gags, subtle jokes, play on words and verses. It's about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you see this more than once, you will find that you quote it as Animal House (and yes I love Animal House too). I put in the top 15 funniest movies. The Major of a Military Academy's boys are paranoid, that each child is bad and will cause problems (in this movie he is right). He is sadistic, scary, cruel and must be dismantled. The group of boys who do not join together end up collaborating to survive and get rid of the Major with a crazy plan that only Mad Magazine could write. A must see - you'll love it!
