A GET IN THE BRAND <br /> <br /> A GIRL IN THE DARK was a movie I had expected to offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, unmarked movie. This assumption stems from the fact that apart from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the film got some attention from the big awards. <br /> <br /> Little do I expect A CRY IN THE DARK to be such a fast-paced drama, well-constructed at all levels. If you ask me, this is an undervalued classic. The movie opens quite slowly, so the audience gets into Chamberlains at a leisurely pace and really notes that in the center they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) chooses random moments to capture a family on vacation, giving a threatening sense of the unpleasant tragedy, while the attentive bliss of Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain cares about their children , shows. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo took my baby!" Has become something of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to ridiculous. Azar's actual death is terribly trapped. It is subtle and realistic, so the audience is horrified and asks questions. The majority of the film takes place in the courtroom and focuses on Chamberlain's continuing struggle to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that from the start it is clear to us that they are innocent makes the tense trials more poignant. As an audience, I was fully invested in Chamberlain's condition ... and was really angry and sad and sad when they were made to look so horrible out of the media. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was in no way made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to keep their views. <br /> <br /> The final line of the movie is very deep and perfectly captures the key element that makes this movie so much different from other courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> With regard to performances, the only ones that really matter in this movie are those from Streep and Neill ... and they deliver in every way. For me, this is one of (if not # 1) Meryl Streep's best performances. For all her mastery of different accents (which of course is very impressive in itself), Streep never loses the core heart and soul of her characters. I think this is one of Streep's more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint for Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is without a doubt Neill's finest work to date. It's a pity that he was not recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match Streep's ... b / c the two of them play brilliantly. <br /> <br /> More emotionally gripping than most movies, and also incredibly exciting ... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know the movie as the girl where Meryl screams "The dingo took my baby!" watch the movie and see how much more is there for a CRY IN THE DARK then one line. <br /> <br /> ...
