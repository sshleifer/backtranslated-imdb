I saw this in the theater during the first release and it was disturbing as I am sure it would still be. It was the first part of '68, and this was still rounding in cities throughout America and there was recently mass murder in my hometown, where I saw this, where a man went on a shooting ramp. The freshness of the close event combined with this dramatized true story created a very disturbing theater experience. It really created the excellent play by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on the true event of Truman Capote and the manuscript and direction of Richard Brooks weaving the event and Truman's interpretation into convincing gritty cinematic adaptation. Music from Quincy Jones scores effectively that is the story. I've only seen this a few times since. It was too real. Almost like witnessing the crime itself and riding with the killers. I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10. Society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this is likely to work slowly and fairly and can be seen with less effect, but for anyone over 50 this will be a feature of the study of the criminal psyche.
