As an old white housewife, I still understand that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. Anyone who appreciates his work as in Deep Cover likes to watch the amazing act of this actor. Since I think this is his direct debut, it can prove even more interesting. All plays are pretty good. If you can't take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a movie you will enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins join each other one day in a movie.
