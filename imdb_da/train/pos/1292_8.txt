Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers especially because of money problems. He is crazy about having his own house and his own rules as his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglected his wishes. A terrible day, Preston rides on his bike; It was the same day that the villain of history, Quigley, tried to scape from the police and accidentally ran the car over Preston's bike. Quigley is busy far away from the police, making a check to cover the damage on Preston's bike. The problem was: It was an empty check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to have a high price on this check: $ 1 million! All the money gives Preston things that he always wanted, like a mansion with pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! The problems begin when the FBI and Quigley will know where the money is, making Preston in a difficult situation and facing many problems. This movie was one of my favorites in my childhood. :)
