My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I've never forgotten it. I had never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she made Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine, so the emotions aren't sexual, I just couldn't see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at my feet as a puppy and stare at her. She has begun to show her age (she is almost seven and a half), but I still believe in her being one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women who ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times since, and it's a juicy melodrama. What saves it is, of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, magnificent scenery, the very impressive elephant stomp and a well-built point of human arrogance to nature. All in all, a well-span is a couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.
