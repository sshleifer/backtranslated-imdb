So today with my 8 year old. I thought it was sweet. I agree with the other poster that it was nothing like the book I can remember but we still enjoyed it. All the kids are pretty good and all in all quite entertaining. Billy is the new child who accepts a tour of the school's bully to eat 10 worms a day. If he loses, he must go down the hall to school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film has been created to show that Billy has a very weak stomach and is nearly all stuffed. Hilarity comes with a lot of different ways to cook. Good message to stand up for bullies and of course a juicy happy ending.
