This is a movie I can see again and again and never get tired of it, it has many laughs, weapons, actions, crime, good lines and a decent plot with an over the top, Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role as Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she has ever done and can also act, Thomas Ian Griffin is fantastic in this as the protagonist "Max" a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV, playing the bad guy ,, "Livingston". The plot centers around Max and Diane, who are trying to catch Livingston while fighting and arguing with each other about who gets the money for their respective agencies, throwing in Assassain Sutherland, which basically has all the good lines, that's the perfect criminal that is the usual love story, but played much differently than you would think at Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, Italian mafia and Chinese mafia here thrown into the mix, the film is shot in Boston, where you have some good shots and locals ,, great photography and music in this movie, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy ,, it has everything you ever want. Check out Sutherland's toilet in a particular scene, very unusual. this movie is a rebellion and makes you laugh really hard 10 plus for me.
