This is a tongue in the cheek film from the start with a voice-over that pokes fun at all French and then produces a rather naive but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Portrait of the splendid Gerard Philippe believes the dashing young man in the fate of Lollobrigida foretells - especially that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! The problem is that La Lollo soon finds out she's also in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Propelled by good sword figures, cavalcades and other exciting action sequences, the movie moves at a fast pace and with many comics moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and takes itself so seriously that I could not give these missing another thought. Watch for Noel Roquevert, a traditional tongue in French movies, trying to steal La Lollo, make herself an overload, and feed the manuscript to the fortune teller who reads La Lollo's hand! And which pearl Marcel Herrand is like the megalomaniac and lust-driven King Louis XV! That's not all: So many beautiful women in a movie make me wish I was in France and back in 1952! The movie may have come out that year, but its enlistment, cheek, excellent narrative, immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to see. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, let alone anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! See it!
