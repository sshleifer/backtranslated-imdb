I can't add a horrible mass to the positive reviews that are already here - great plays, balanced writing, many faceted characters, a great anti hero in Tony, great commentary on the millennial American life. Integrated use of psychiatry combined with Ton's mother problems is especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters give a lot of depth - Hesh's interesting story as an outsider muscles in, Ralphie's total irreversible evil, Chris's dual wishes in life, etc. I have to dig into some of the criticisms though, especially 'it glorifies the violence / belittles of Italian-Americans'. Most of the authors and actors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef, Dr. Melfi and her family and Cusaman's neighbor to Sopranos. In fact, Dr. Melfi's former man in season 1, that only a small minority of Italian-Americans have ever had mob connections (certainly less than the proportion of African Americans involved in crime, dare I say so. In both cases, poverty and lack of opportunities are the main reasons). <br /> <br /> Most of the characters don't really choose the life they have; Family background or circumstances largely corner them into it. Outsiders (even of Italian stock) trying to integrate into it usually face unpleasant ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example. If you criticize this show, do I suppose Frasier made you a psychiatrist or Will & Grace make you go gay? Probably you won't listen to rap music discussing gang or r'n'b discussing promiscuity or rock music discussing drugs (or any other combination)? People are not as stupid as some of you do. <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect, though. A lot of signs have only been once since they should of all logic should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, England's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's girlfriend (supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1 ).
