ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> <br /> Plot: Elvira ( Cassandra Peterson) completes her television show and heads to the little Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes gathering on her dead aunt's heritage, hoping to make big money to open a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her, everything she gets is an eerily old house, a poodle and a magical cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira is trying to make money, draw a life in teens, win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene), avoid being burned to the stake and keep the cookbook from his scary uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who is planning to use the book for to finish the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and fun woman and as Elvira she is all that plus morbid and hilarious naive, not to mention she has a fantastic couple of knockers. In this movie, her charm is used for good. <br /> <br /> I loved the whole 'fish out of water' for the movie. You have Elvira, with her shaven black dress, her big black hair and her huge twins, and she's in a Christian city where most of the girls don't even have to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as big as Elvira's uncle / nemesis Vincent, stealing the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but still not in the way and steals scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the movie is not plotted, but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh much more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I hear there are about 56 bob jokes in this movie and any fan of Roger Corman B horror flicks will love spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you'll love this flick.
