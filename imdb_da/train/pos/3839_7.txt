Most people know Paul Verhoeven as director of many good (and bad) sci-fi films in Hollywood. But long before he shot generic thrillers in his home country. History is a basic femme fatal premise, nothing new or enthralling. Verhoeven believes that he can do better by adding in a series of dream sequences, which, instead of defining our main character and his situation, is only used as a way to advance to the predictable plot. The play was solid, the dialogue helps blow the effects of mere history. What really made the movie at least good was some amazing play. Jereone Crab was great as the "tortured artist", and the followers were also very good. In addition, Jan De Bonts film film adds at least some life to the film, which helps make Verhoeven look at least as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
