I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the version 1971 rather boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times (as I did with the 1971 version) than for me, it's not that good. Of course, this may be because I was only nine at the time of the 1971 edition. However, I have seen many remakes where I have liked the original and the older one better. I found out that the 1997 edition was more comprehensible and had essentially been true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 edition. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 version more excited and was not so "blase". (Or hole)
