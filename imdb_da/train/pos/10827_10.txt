Still Crazy has been compared to Spinal Tap as both are comedies about washing up R&R groups. In fact, the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out, while Spinal Tap scripts worsen from the mildly entertaining first 10 minutes in a drive that makes Beavis and Butthead seem sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formal, but the characters are equal and the unexpectedly high quality of some music tracks for me managed to offset the film's a priori predictability. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempts at satire would be disappointed with the light nature of the movie, but I would take a successful self-ironic body of Still Crazy over a pompous but unsuccessful satire, which is Spinal Tap.
