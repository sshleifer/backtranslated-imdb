This is a well-established documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car racing. The photograph is simply outstanding. The scene was Mario Andretti driving the old racing roadster down New England Street lined with the old maple leaves blown to the side of the car's speed, incredible. The movie loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like watching cars driven to their border, you should watch this movie.
