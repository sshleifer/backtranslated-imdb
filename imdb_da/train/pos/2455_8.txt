It's a pretty good movie, but also American in that predictability. Switch Kung Fu to football and the Turkish family to a Pakistani, and you'll see Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene by stage. A great feature that serves as the backbone of the movie is the advancement of the struggles with the mysterious ninja under the highway, which begins with miserable losses and slowly progresses until the last battle is a victory over itself, as the Kung Fu Master emphasized repeatedly. On another level, the Danish life is obviously different from the image it has of outsiders: the non-immigrant immigrants, who make up a large proportion (in fact the majority) of Danish citizenship, graffiti in Copenhagen's suburbs, the immigrant girl in the beggar about the film. Everyone portrays a different picture than you remember when you hear the word Denmark.
