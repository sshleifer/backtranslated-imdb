I really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more. A little soft on the front of the crime (it's almost an afterthought and not terribly exciting or fleshed out), but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming. Will look again for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope they get a bigger role for the aunts, who are wonderful actresses and a little underused this time. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched I think) is very sweet and bubbly and comes out as well dorky and sweet rather than stupid and annoying, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
