... and if you are very, very good, it looks like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a little stupid story, but it was a fantasy after all, and casting and acting were accurate! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / cheater, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors. You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This was one of Dreyfus best roles, just as his character has his best role in publishing the dead dictator! And the divorce scene: As something out of Casablanca, yes! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was great as the paradorian chief of the secret police. He gets some really fun lines, some of which are tribute to other movies, like "Round up the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as a girl friend - besides being a really hot number: "You gotta get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the many guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - everything perfectly done. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable body during the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
