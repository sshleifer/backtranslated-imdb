Just a comment on New Orleans accents ... A previous reviewer noted the following: "This movie could have been shot in New York or another northern city because it presents us with characters that speak more like" broklynse "than maybe a southern accent one can hear in that part of the country. "There was also another comment in this direction from an English reviewer. Many people in New Orleans actually make the sound "broklynse". I've never figured out why. (It is mentioned in John Kennedy Toole, "A Confederacy of Dunces.") I appreciate movies that take place in New Orleans that include this detail as it did. All too often it is just the Hollywood version of the normal southern accent.
