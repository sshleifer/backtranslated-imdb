Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> Although the leading actress is STRICTLY beautiful, the plot stands a little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of history. <br /> <br /> One can think that middle-class teenage school girls in the 1950s easily gave away their virginity without thinking of marriage to 30-year-olds they hardly know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> "GOOD GIVE BOR VIRGINITY"? WHAT PRINT NOTES ON THIS MOVIE. Definitely. <br /> <br /> One might think that young colleges are very confident and confident as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world. You just aren't quite able to see the world differently than through your own eyes? That's cute. <br /> <br /> One can think that an experienced physician would not know the tight orthodox of Stroptomycin - the smelly fermenting by-product of busy soil microbes - and not discover that any lifeless soft powder is false, but I do not believe. <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER "EXPERT" OPINION DRAWN FROM EXPERIENCE. DANDY. <br /> <br /> One can think that 30-year-old troublemakers can get in and hang out, a primary school recall during a school social and trouble, but I think the school's social is traditionally a protected environment, and parents, chaparons and school staff would be around to prevent this. Now you are a good sport and tell us where the institution you grow. <br /> <br /> One last nit, through Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends referred to themselves as foursome. There is probably an explanation as to why the five were the four, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> COURSES ARE AN EXPLANATION. Good job showing it! Now I want to be general and will help you out of your misery: Even though it was translated as a general "four", the word "Ã¨ETVORKA" has a different meaning: IT IS A SPORT TERM USED FOR DESIGNER A 4M OR 4W SETUP - A RED CREW INCLUDING 5 PERSONS: 4 ROWERS AND A COXSWAIN. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't really ring for me. We should all hear about your competent and praising opinion. GUY.
