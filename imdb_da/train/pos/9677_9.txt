This movie works on the surface to be a race of mill kids movies that parents can regret with their most marvelous little children. The movie seems and is mainly aimed at children, but it does not stop at this level. I first looked at this movie as a young child and found it to be fun, entertaining and heart-warming and didn't see it again for years. I saw it again recently in 18 years and found it almost as fun, but equally cordial and entertaining. This movie is heavily underestimated and contains many messages of real life. This film is an inspirational quest story made for children yet epic in itself. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
