This is a truly classic movie in its history, acting and film presentation. Amazing actors are full of the movie, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart are the prominent characters. In real life, she admired a lot and liked Jimmy, and gave him his basic first-acting roles and helped him to be more calm with his appearance on the set. The chemistry between the two was always clear and so warm and fun to see. She was such a beautiful young woman, and so sweet in her personality images. The story of these two young people and how they eventually come together is charming to see and pure magic entertainment. Heart warming presentations are also provided by the other supportive actors in this amazing story / movie. I totally miss Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal to all generations. A must see for everyone!
