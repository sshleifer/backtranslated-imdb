I stopped briefly to give "Mr. Blanding's Build His Dream House" 10/10 because of an aspect that makes us in the 21st century a bit crooked: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (reminds me Stepin Fetchit). But apart from that, the movie is a hoot. Portraits in the New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a house in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual flippant, while Loy does quite well as just a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs like Jim and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole who seem to have more plans than he does. As for the house itself ... in most of the movie, you will probably feel ambiguous about whether or not you want to live there. The builders, contractors and others also give their reasonable share of laughs. All in all, a comedy classic. Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
