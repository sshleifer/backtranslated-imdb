Once a year a movie "comes" and makes it easy for you. You do not have an effort to believe it is good, it is just that. You enjoy it while you see it and you take it home with you. I can't say it's completely flawless, but it's close. Acting - large, historically interesting and with voltage elements. It's a small family story, pretty much predictable, but it's not the secret self that matters. That's the way it takes the blind girl to reach it. I was impressed with the way in which the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I didn't like much about is the actor who played the mother, she was too hard and without necessity. Keren
