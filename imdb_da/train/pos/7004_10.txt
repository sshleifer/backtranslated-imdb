Will Smith is one of the best actors from all the time. I don't know how he does it. I read books constantly, but if there is a movie with Will Smith I will see it. He has a rare gift to draw you into the movie and stay there. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen yet. I saw it on Saturday and I still can't get it out of my head. FANTASTIC and sad everything at the same time. Thanks again Will. You have to watch this movie from start to finish to understand every part of the movie. You can't miss anything. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your husband / wife is sitting next to you so you can enjoy. Well worth the money that you will pay to see it .. Don't wait for it to come on TV.
