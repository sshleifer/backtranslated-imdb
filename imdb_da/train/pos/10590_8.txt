This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day, but somehow one did not find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be entirely new, but added so much to history. And who could forget about Pax, the beautiful guide dog in the series! <br /> <br /> Although the stories themselves may not have been better than the average series, the settings in New Orleans, the play and the music (I notice the comment about the music score in other comments ... I remember clearly) will all work to do a good TV show even better! <br /> <br /> Now you never know ... one day Paramount can just dig into its archives and drop it on DVD!
