I thought it was a very charming movie. The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is well on the way, but the best performances are with his grandmother, Mink Chairs (a hilarious como) and of all people, Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are far away from the base of this one. They seem to take Pecker's worst valuation of his work as a gospel when I think the film clearly says he is actually a promising artist.
