If the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie that the musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded me. Common human situations became original, personal and immediate, so I personally felt affected by every situation. I think I would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie. Without destroying, I can say that I was very moved by the film's approach to living. Didn't actually shout out what? empathy? just deep emotions? in a very long time. I would love to find a way to show it to others. Saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
