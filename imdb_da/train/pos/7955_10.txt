This is one of the greatest children's movies ever created. I cry every time I see shadow shouting: "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car pulls away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best movie ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. As when Sassy says to Chance; "Cat's Rule and Dogs Choke!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six, I bet I loved that line. The story may seem passionate to some, but I like it. Shadow like the older dog who prepares Chance to take him over when he's gone, really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "Homeward Bound."
