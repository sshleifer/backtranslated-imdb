Never seen this 1971 movie and was greatly entertained by this amazing production created by Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played an excellent role as a woman who had taken a witchcraft course and was an apprentice who began to fly on a diet and had quite a few problems to deal with. Eglantine discovered many tricks and could make a bed trip to different parts of the world. Eglantine, however, missed his final exams to become a complete witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he is trying to help her in every way to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for her madness and that is to stop the Nazis from leaving England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies like this today.
