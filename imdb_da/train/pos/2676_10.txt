Every day we can see a large number of films, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director of realization. For me, there are two films that everyone needs to see: the first is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. Second is "Journey of Hope". As humans, we must learn about humility, the love of others, the acceptance of other civilization, the other way of life. We also have to fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; we must only love our roommate. This wonderful movie helps us reach John (Lennon )'s dream: Imagine all the people living in peace. These two movies are hard to see: look at these, but make sure you get hurt, but better. Great movie, great actors, horrible story, pain and crying guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. Enjoy it.
