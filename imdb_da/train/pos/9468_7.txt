I have seen a special pre-screening of this today. I have to tell you, I'm not a big fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations to go into this. I ended up enjoying it completely. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with their family. While in a bookstore meeting the woman in her dreams, only to find out she happened to be his brother's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty well made - soundtracks, movies and plays are all top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mainly with Dane Cook's character. We never really look close to the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt that it might have helped a little by showing what Dan's inner conflict about being in love with Danes girlfriend was like. Apart from this, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid, sweet movie - definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've got this year.
