John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought on display with maximum star power in this romantic fantasy of a modern witch who begs a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart can get top billing, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most prominent witches ever to throw a spell on the movie screen. The leading mating is actually one of the few weaknesses of the movie: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role, and while it's easy to see why he's getting tough for Novak, it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him. as they seem inconsistent in temperament and outlook. (It is one of history's entertaining notions that witches and warlocks are portrayed as the Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously, Stewart-Novak mating will generate much more warmth in "Vertigo" released the same year as this movie but then "Vertigo" had a compelling thrill story and the benefits of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. <br /> <br /> The comic moments of the movie are mainly provided by the star-studded cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (like Kim's Warlock brother), Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt), and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a confused author. Hermione Gingold even appears in a hilarious como as a kind of Grand Witch. There is a lot to like in this movie - joke, romance and a great cast - that is, if you might be able to take the eyes of the enchanting Miss Novak. I've seen the movie half a dozen times, and I can never.
