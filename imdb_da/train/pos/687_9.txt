This is a very entertaining flick, considering the budget and its length. The story is almost never touched in the film world, so it also led to a sense of novelty. The action was great (P'z to Dom) and the filmmaker was also very well done. I recommend this movie to anyone in thrillers, it will not disappoint you!
