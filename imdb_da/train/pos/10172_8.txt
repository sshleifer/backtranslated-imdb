Friz Freleng's "Rumor" is an excellent private Snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumors in wartime. Produced as all Snafu shorts to be exhibited to military audiences as entertaining instructional films, 'Rumors' is extremely imaginative and spans lots of ideas into its very short lifespan. When Snafu starts a rumor of a bombing, it escalates into a rumor that America has lost the war. This is illustrated brilliantly in the form of a long, rubbery piece of baloney and several strange, fictional creatures coming back to haunt Snafu with increasingly horrible news about his country's military. 'Rumors' are ingenious, fast and fun, all contributing to overshadowing the right work, "not badmouth the military" message. It stands out as one of the best of the private Snafu shorts.
