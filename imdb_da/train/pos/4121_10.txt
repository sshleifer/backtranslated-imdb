This tends to be weak by many critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It is an episodic multi-character study of Toko's poorest living in a city that is literally made of waste. Although it looks like an A-Bomb has just hit, the movie has some kind of quiet beauty thanks to the brilliant use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of the crazy young man who drives an imaginary wagon through the slums. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories exciting, but perhaps the most tragic relates to the man and his young son living in an abandoned car. When not seeking food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. An emotionally moving and beautiful movie.
