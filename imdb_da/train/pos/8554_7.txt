Wow, this was another good spin off of the original American pie, not as good as the band camp, but definitely much better the naked mile. Dwight and Erik stifler lead the comedy in this one, but I actually preferred the dialogue in this to the naked mile. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, but most of the comedy came from sex, but that's okay, because that's why we see these movies in order anyway? <br /> <br /> Midget Rock also had a really good cameo in view of the intense effort he gave in the naked mile, his scene with stifler was amazing and made me laugh my ass when I saw it. /> <br /> The movie was a concrete improvement in my opinion of the naked mile, if you liked any previous American Pie movies, you should have a beta house unless you see all the American pie spins -offs a waste of money.
