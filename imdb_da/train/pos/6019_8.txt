ZP is deeply related to the youth dream represented by the hippie movement. The college debate at the beginning of the film indicates the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. The explosion, which Daria envisions, represents the fall of all social structures, and therefore the evolution of all the great transformation that society suffers and eventually the death of Mark expects the end that A sees for the movement itself. The movie is more easily understood if we go back to that time of life. During the 60s and 70s, young people were the driving force behind the deep fears of change. One of the more significant changes was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women of absolute freedom would perform in the hypothetical situation where would be no one to hide from. I saw the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and valued the magnificent way in which A depicted the impossibility of continuing to store this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to "control" social outbreaks at that time, and that is the method the police use to stop students. This community suffers from hipocresy, and it is evident when students gain access to weapons that skip all false controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who is detained for no reason, shows part of the society who is interested in this youth feeling and partially completely uninterested. Presenting flight as the more precise symbol of freedom, representing the stolen by the plane Mark's inner desire for it, but his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulty of getting rid of those bonds and which I have That said, A portrays the death of the dream by these difficulties in winning the game. In my view, a movie to remember.
