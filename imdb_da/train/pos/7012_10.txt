Although a tears it is definitely a "good" movie. All the actors were excellent and will Smith who always does the job and does it well. I could go on but choose any ten of the "10" ratings and they have said it as well and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I have to include at least 10 lines to write a comment, I would say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was most enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing her perform in many movies that come. <br /> <br /> This film shows that Will Smith has nothing to prove about his acting as an actor.
