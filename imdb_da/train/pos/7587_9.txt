I have to say that I was impressed that the cinematography was amazing, the frames close to perfection, and the way he built the excitement of a subject that looks more like a horrible bore is beyond. <br /> <br /> The film is about two storytellers, one set, one invisible. They both try to explain the significance of a series of paintings that caused a scandal long ago. The film is about theories and explanations of views, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I have to say. Absolutely a movie that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With just 66 minutes to play out, the plot movie still felt like a complete job. Great direction! I have to say far better than the poet's blood, as for some strange reason it reminds me a little. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call it the slang word "artsy". It is pretty much a lot of professional talk about different theories and amazing visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz took it off. At least for me. A great movie.
