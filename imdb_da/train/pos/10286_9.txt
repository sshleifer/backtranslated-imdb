This movie is amazing! Although it is fun and entertaining, it is also deep and eye-opening. I want to see it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but that's not what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and annoying that his life is not the way he imagines it, should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce stops losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him godly powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he had imagined it would take to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses the only person who truly loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that might occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what really was there. This film was inspiring and deep. If you really keep an eye on it, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humble respect for the fact that much of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "When does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition, "May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while trying to figure it out."
