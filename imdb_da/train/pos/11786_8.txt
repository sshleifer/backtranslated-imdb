This is almost typical Lynch. But what makes this movie a bit unusual for Lynch is that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I think Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism that serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments. But many typical Lynch motives are present, such as: liquid camera work; joking music; long (unpleasant) breaks hanging curtains; fog lights become darker at a slow (almost inseparable) pace; extreme close-ups themes of women in trouble; indulgent, incompetent, all knowing signs turn out to be signs that are confused, temporarily ignorant, in the dark, etc. ... the performance is great and the short is thought-provoking. Lynch usually leaves almost everything for interpretation. Many questions are unanswered and it takes the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort by Lynch. I just hope he does some shorts, more like his Sony Playstation 2 commercials. They were inspired.
