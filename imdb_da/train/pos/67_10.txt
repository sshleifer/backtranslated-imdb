The industry lost the ball on this. The trailer does not do the film's justice, and when it was opened it was on a hand full of screens. Had people had the opportunity to see this, footwork had made it very successful. The two leading actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you into the story and especially the characters. I checked this out based on the rave recommendation Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that was never completely released except on a few screenshots. Which gave it no chance to be seen. Some movies go fast to video because they are not that good. This is Oscar worthy, and it is a tragedy on many levels that most people will never hear about it. Perhaps by mouth to mouth you get the following on DVD or cable. If you haven't seen this movie, you need to. Great performances by the 2 leading actresses make this movie. It could just have been another formal teenage movie after the school's special, but instead it looks good to other worthy movies. Girl interrupted comes to mind. If you like it, you will like this. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in a fantastic emotional scene after another without coming out as melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna cries through most of the movie, it's done so a real way they don't come out as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic. The movie will move you in many scenes, and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real ideas as your school. Erica is even better in this than in traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles that also exploit their talents and let them shine. Watch this movie and if you like, it is recommended to friends so it is not lost among all the giant crap coming out every year. This movie was buried, while Spiderman's 2 peaks took place. What kind of words do we live in? AGHhh. So to make the world really look again and recommend it.
