Written by the author who wrote the excellent Murder Rooms series that crowned ACD's adventure with Dr. Joseph Bell, I looked forward to this, and I was not disappointed. It went quite slowly, with great emphasis on Doyle's frustration with Sherlock Holmes, who was very precise and well portrayed. It was an interesting character study and very well shot (on digital video, unusual for a period piece). The action was excellent all the time, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who portrayed the ACD whose name I can't remember impressed me. An excellent character study that has about the same number of phrases as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See this if you get the chance
