I hadn't seen this movie since the late 80's and decided to download the VHS version of it. The reason is very slow, and the actors almost seem to be robots in this breakdance flick. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. Breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin", but I have to say that "Breakin 1 & 2" carries the energy and excitement of the screen much better. It's a movie I want to keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can see again and again, just once in a blue moon.
