"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals from time to time, but it is fun and accessible to many audiences. The original movie could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke representing his signature Broadway role, but instead thinking about the plot, so the movie is very unsatisfactory. This re-make, which was broadcast on ABC in 1995, is far more true to the original manuscript and also contains some original songs that were used in a national tour that this movie took off from which Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who Choreographed this movie.) Jason Alexander is a completely different type from Dick Van Dyke, but he is well cast as Albert (before his "Seinfeld" days he began in musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. Their is also a good work from Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role he played on the national tour). <br /> <br /> This movie is not without it, however, problems. A big responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, however, looks attractive and seems too old to be teenage Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat bland as his father throws away some "kids" (a number of original cast member Paul Lynde stole the show.) But all in all, this is a nice, well-liked movie that the material deserved.
