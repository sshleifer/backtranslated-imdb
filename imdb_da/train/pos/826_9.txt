I'm sorry people are looking at Ewoks! True, they are not the best that ever happened to Star Wars, but they did, so handle it! Moreover, they are cute and I don't care if they can be traded. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end couldn't be better. I am thrilled with The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly highlight the entire story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you complaining that the Father's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick man. He is not quite a machine - he is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I don't know how the casting director considered choosing such good actors in a new hope. They do it all well. They are credible signs. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher is a good job as a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even though many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - should I say more? <br /> <br /> The music is once again brilliant. It's so much touching and significant when you can choose character themes on different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and jumps out to fight his father in Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What a fantastic man! The movie always has so much more importance to me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theaters (can I wait ???) and then see the original trilogy again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
