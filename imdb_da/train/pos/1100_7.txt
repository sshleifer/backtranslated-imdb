- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) has become tired of the rat race and tight living conditions in New York and finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find the simple life. But building a house turns out to be anything but simple. When headaches and bills start to pile up, then the laughs do. Will Mr. Mixing ever get your dream home? <br /> <br /> - What makes this movie so special are the three main players - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Any one of three is able to carry a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost all scenes are special. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. He is so good at playing the set on man. Loy is always a joy to see. The Thin Man movie she made with William Powell is almost perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> - The movie is definitely a product of its time. I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bathroom house at $ 15,000 a year. Throw in that your two children go to private school and you have a living girl and it becomes almost imaginative. <br /> <br /> - But for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments Mix's find themselves are easily related to today. And this is where the comedy comes in. How many people have made some of the stupid things the couple do in this movie to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole "wife in love with best friend" subplot. It's really not necessary to plot and feel out of place and very uncomfortable as presented.
