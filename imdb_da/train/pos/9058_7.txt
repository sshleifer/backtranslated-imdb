I read the book in 5th grade and now a couple of years later I watched the film. There are a few differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was oringinally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days and not 10 worms a day at 7:00. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy assumes $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe assumes fake some of the worms, but in the movie he doesn't do it at all. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this movie is still one that kids will enjoy.
