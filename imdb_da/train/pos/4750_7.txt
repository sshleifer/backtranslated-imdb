In Stand by Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was harder, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who will win a fight too. Sometimes we become absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it looks like we're discussing guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison when Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you go for what we've seen from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, at least you should say he would match well with Chan. In this film he comes across as a martial arts god. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is about a man created with many other men to be sovereign campaigns. Their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some ways. Now it is the prerequisite for the movie, but what it does is create all the fantastic choreographed battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a marvel. He can do things with and to his body that no man should do. And that's what makes him look so fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to martial arts in the film, Black Mask is strong with humor, and this is due to the chemistry Jet has with his fellow star police officer. They are big together. But to be honest. If anyone reads this review, they would like to know if the movie is kick-ass in the action section. And the answer to that is a resounding YES !!! Lots of gory mindless action. You will love this movie.
