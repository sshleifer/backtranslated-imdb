As a lifelong fan of Dickens, I have always been disappointed with the adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works featured an extremely precise mention of human life at all levels in Victorian Britain, it was all a pervasive thread of humor that could be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative dictated. In a way, he was a literary caricature and cartoonist. He could be serious and fun in the same sentence. He dotted pride, lampooned arrogance, celebrated modesty and empathized with loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a people's author. And that's the comedy that so often lacks in his interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is dramatized in serial form on BBC TV. All misery and cruelty are theirs, but not of humor, irony and wild lampoonery. The result is just a dark, gloomy experience: the story written by a journalist rather than a novelist. It's not Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!' By contrast, much closer to the mark. The officer's mockery is interpreted, from the blustering beadle to the drunk magistrate. The classic stand-off between beadle and Mr Brownlow, where the law is described as "an ass, an idiot" could not have been better done. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But the dazzling cruelty is also there, the state's monstrous indifference, the cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are all presented as surely as the Master would have wanted. <br /> <br /> Then there's the crime. Ron Moody is a treasure like the bad Jewish fence, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> It may not be surprising that Lionel Bart - even a Jew from the eastern end of London - takes freedom with Fagin by reinterpreting him as a much more benign guy than Dicken's original. In the novel, he was completely ruthless and sent some of his own boys to the gallows to protect himself (though he was also caught and hung). In the film he is presented as something of a colorless father figure, a kind of charitable thief rather than a corrupt of children, the latter being a prolonged anti-Semitic feeling. Otherwise, very few freedoms are taken with Dickens original. All the most memorable items are included. Just enough threat and violence are preserved to ensure confidentiality while allowing children's sensitivity. Nancy is still dead, Bullseye narrowly escapes, and Bill Sykes gets a faithful graphic combo. <br /> <br /> Each song is excellent even though they slope at schmaltz. Mark Lester mimics his wonderful. Both his and my favorite scene is the world where the world comes to life for 'who will buy'. It's schmaltzy, but it's Dickens through and through. <br /> <br /> I could continue. I could praise the wonderful set pieces, the contrast of the rich and the poor. There is top quality that comes from several British regulars than you could shake a stick. <br /> <br /> I should give it 10 points, but I feel more like Scrooge today. Soak it up on Christmas Eve. No original has been better realized.
