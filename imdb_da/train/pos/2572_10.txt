I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy films so combined that they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite films. Jim Belushi is hysterical, and Jerry Lee is fun and sweet, they make a good team. The only downside is that I really didn't understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said that, I must have missed it. Apart from that, I give it two thumbs up! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) should have had a lot of training. They were so funny and all the sounds Jerry Lee would do when Dooley spoke to him was so much fun. My favorite was when Jerry Lee sang, and then he would bite people to get information very fun lol
