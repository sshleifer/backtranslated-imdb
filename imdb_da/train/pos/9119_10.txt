Interesting way of looking at how we, as humans, so often behave, we sometimes become blind by our desire to achieve perfection, that we sometimes destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the question of how we tend to ignore them among those who are not so unimaginable, and by doing so may miss a great opportunity. Injection of comedy also makes watching the movie an enjoyable experience. One must look for everyone who is interested in a reflective but comical look at life. I look forward to your next product. Hope you will continue to give us quality entertainment. Excellent work ...... Joanne
