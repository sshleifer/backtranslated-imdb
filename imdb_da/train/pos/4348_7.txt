Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warm humorous and gently tender story about the family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THINGS ABOUT MY PEOPLE do not set new standards for film, but it is a nice little story that is well told, reminiscent of the significant bonds that the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic who at times pushes his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background . One day, Muriel leaves a note that after many years of marriage she leaves! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin their search for her whereabouts, leave the confused and hurt and disgrace Sam for sorting things on a road trip with son Ben. The weather becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean for their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in her life and introduces the now work-based Ben to the joy and fun of living. The trip is completed with a phone call about Muriel's whereabouts, and why she left and regrouping the wiser family draws the warm end of history. Everything is not what it worked: It is better and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play each other as the benefits they are, but in many ways the movie belongs to the short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on display and reminds us that she is one of ours. strongest matriarchs on film. Worth to see. Grady Harp
