This movie is huge for enlightening Spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I see it, I see and hear funny little things that I missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs, making Strange Fruit the best ever hit the current music scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly fictitious washed up in the 60s to 70s band, which was never good at first for drug use and inner struggle. One wonders what could have been while listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The fruit draws inspiration from The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. member of fruit is quite memorable. Stephen Rea stars as down-and-dead bread Tony Costello, who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour hoping to reap monetary benefits. Costello haply approaches ex-roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him revive the flame of a dream long past. <br /> <br /> Juliet gathers the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), blundering Timothy Spall David 'Beano' Baggot and extravagant glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Tumbling in is another ex-roadie, the hippy-toker jokester Hughie (Billy Connolly) who never lets the flame burn out. <br /> <br /> When Juliet searches for the last member of their modley band, guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by the burning Bruce Robinson), reunited members squabble, like old times, fighting over each other's rusty talent. <br /> <br /> The band then gets the chance to make a small Dutch tour to prepare for the festival. With the young Hendrix-like Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) taking Lovell place, the crew hits the road. The sparks fly like their memories flare forward, threaten to burn their unfinished targets ... Be prepared to laugh, sing, cheer, and cry, as these memorable characters eat back in your hearts. .
