This very strange movie, unlike anything made in the west at that time. With its tumultuous feelings and precisely of visions, dreams and amazing images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. It contains the only dream sequence I know of that actually looks like a real nightmare (sorry Dali fans).
