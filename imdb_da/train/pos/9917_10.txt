This is the most confrontational documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centered on Chinese modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings life to life for confrontational issues that we so easily chose to ignore. <br /> <br /> With no political side, this film is a neutral liquid image of realities that our Western societies choose not to educate us on - by-products of economic growth, externalities paid by citizens of the less developed communities, the source of our comforts and waste in our consumer's lifestyle. /> <br /> Fantastic, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but it is worth taking - stop being ignorant and at least see these pictures of the truth without feeling any pressure to address these issues. 10/10 absolutely!
