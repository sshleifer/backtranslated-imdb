Wow, this movie had a big impact on me, it moved me. It's a great story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold in sex trade. I can't stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The movie's setting is realistic. The movie was an eye-opener, I can't imagine anyone going away from it without helping to make a change with this awful problem that exsists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The <br /> <br /> girl playing Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a great performance. The movie moved me to tears, It tells an important message to be heard worldwide. Everyone should watch this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
