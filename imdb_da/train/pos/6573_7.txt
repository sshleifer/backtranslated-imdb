The movie has seen the feeling of a game right from the start - I think it would make a better game than a movie because set and dramatization make a movie version seem a little too artificial. But it's still done quite well, and the story and especially the dialogue is interesting. They have taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as it is from the game itself. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's plays. The main character Raina has his head in the clouds & and a flair for the dramatic, and Helena Bonham Carter's play does a good job here. Her fianc√©, Serges, is a bit too comic, as he really has to be a very nice, sharp figure. Her parents are entertaining enough.
