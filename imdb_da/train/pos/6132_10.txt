I'm glad that users (like this date) who liked this movie now come forward. I do not understand the people who did not like this movie - it seems they were expecting a serious (?!?!?) Treatment! Let me know how in hell can you take a killing snowman's premise seriously? The film authorities knew this was a silly premise and they were not trying to deny it. The fair supply of scenes makes it really fun! Yes, there are times when the low budget shows (like the explosion scene), but I think an expensive look would have taken away from the movie's fun! So if you like B-movies and the stupid premise appeals to you, then you will definitely like "Jack Frost".
