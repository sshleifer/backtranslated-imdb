I must say I loved the vanishing point. I've seen the original and it's a pretty good remake of it. Although it did not follow the original story (that is why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good, and that's probably a better story. <br /> <br /> With regard to the car, well DJ's comment at the end of Challenger goes 185 mph in the bulldozer is pretty unlikely (And if you see, the Speedometer drove the needle at 145-150), but even though I didn't see one The engine in one of the starting scenes where they show the engine, the original story had a supercharged Hemi as possible. For those of you who say that the aerodynamics would not allow it, the normally-sucked Chrysler 300C today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing going on a highway with it, it's like pushing a wall at the wind of 70 mph. Plus, in a wind tunnel test, if you put an air dam on Challenger, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
