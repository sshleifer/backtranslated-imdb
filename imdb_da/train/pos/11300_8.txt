Ossessione Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement - yes it says it right on the back of the box - and is sometimes a penetrating, sometimes boring portrait of lonely individuals in moral flux. Seen in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting figures - including an inventive drive that promotes communist virtues - embody the distant desperation of a country seeking its identity from outside, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the deprived and his ability to express their deplorable affairs was already well-developed, the scam of fraud is stupid - even though a staple is unable to allow a protagonist to manipulate the fate and the femme fatal, Gino here so unhinged at first that you fear he might deserve it - the cosmic irony for didactic, the illegal relationship tense with bathos. Still, it is sharp and crucial, although the actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
