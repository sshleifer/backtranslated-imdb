One of the best comedy series ever to come out of the UK. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and artists who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy. They have largely supported their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they have followed the series of the most memorable characters in recent years. Little Britain pales in insignificance as a bad imitation of their ideas. Consistently Original and Groundbreaking I am sure many people hate these series as love for them, but I am just as sure no one could have any opinion on LOG. I have not yet seen the movie file, but I have heard good things and bad things so I will reserve the verdict. The original radio series from which LOG came was as innovative as the TV series was. I do not know if the TV series made it to the United States, but I would be fascinated to see how the American audience found the strange English language of humor
