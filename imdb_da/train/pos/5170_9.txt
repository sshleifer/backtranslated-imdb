I rented this movie when it came out on videotape and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and have seen it several times since. I would agree with others when they said Indian summer was nostalgic movie. When I see it, I want me to be 10-14 again. So I think we all like the movie to some extent. We sometimes want us to relive our lives as children with wisdom / knowledge of adults. Wouldn't it be great to have all your friends / parents be young again? Not to worry about your job, being a parent, etc. ??? I know I want to jump into a De Lorean and go back in time. While I enjoyed the movie a lot, my all time favorite camp movie is meatballs with Bill Murray. I want them to make an Indian summer version of it.
