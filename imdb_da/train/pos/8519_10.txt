Awful ..... This may have been a bad attempt to remake the already restored Omen Movie, but I've decided it. <br /> <br /> The last man who commented is a fool, this movie was one of a kind, and Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have applauded this movie. <br /> <br /> Great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror movies and soundtracks So listen to what I have to say, not the other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that doesn't fascinate me, the endings. According to the prophecy, it is all inaccurate, including final conflict and abandonment. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is .... There good movies ... and must be seen before the Great Depression falls on us and before the Democrats Also take over the Presidency. <br /> <br /> So signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer, with a mastermind.
