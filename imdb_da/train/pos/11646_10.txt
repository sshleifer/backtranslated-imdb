This movie, though it is about one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers manufacturers: the extreme life of our cities, has a fun way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the more important Mexican directors, from the past, are approaching stories from our city framed in various literary varieties as it may be farce or satire, giving us a movie with an over-exposed subject in our country, but told in a very different way that gives a freshness tone to him. <br /> <br /> With some well-known players who interpret their excellent paper, each director in the stories reflects the capacity of being identified throughout the world, the ability to laugh, and celebrating sadness. Perhaps for many people in our country, the film is not satisfied, but I believe that people from other countries can find attractive and share Mexican surrealism.
