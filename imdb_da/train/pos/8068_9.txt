To watch this movie from start to finish without jumping to laughter at some point requires almost a pulpit, which one must say to oneself, "it's old", "it's a classic", "please" Not because the film is so bad, but because it is so good it is best. This is a dated movie. It is also a classic if one is tarnished. I'm not inclined to laugh at people in principle, and I get more than a little annoyed when others do. Making fun of The Informer in my opinion is a bit like giggling with an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth. Yes, you say to himself, he is an idiot, and yet when he is on top of his game, he is also a true savant. The same goes for The Informer, which is sometimes very terrible, yet boasts fantastic photography, some fine acting, a wonderful score and a good, decent simple story. Ultimately, as I will not give away, politics, religion and psychology come together in a church in such a way that the scene looks majestic and over the top, yet life is at times. Untrained people with simple faith behave differently from us (presumably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. But people behave the way they say such things. Not everyone is hip, and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip. Are people today so much better than the seventy-seven years ago? And in what way? I do not think. We are just different. Now go see the movie.
