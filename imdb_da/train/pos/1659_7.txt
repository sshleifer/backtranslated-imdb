A fragment of the life of one of the first female painters to gain historical recognition, "Artemisia" tells the true story of a young Italian woman's passionate pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film has lavish costuming and sets and a good cast and acting. However, it is confused in his attempt to portray esoterics in art and time and is uninspired in his representation of the artist's passion as painted on canvas and explored through her involvement with men. A great movie for those interested in Renaissance painting or period films.
