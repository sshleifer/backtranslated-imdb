Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters the magician's box on stage in a London theater. A little bit by Sondra that the spirit of the recently deceased journalist Joe Strombel materializes to ask her to investigate the man someone has told him on his journey to another dimension is the infamous Tarot killer who has been on the cold of crime in London. The only problem is that the man who is accused is, for all looks, a respectable upper class man. <br /> <br /> When Sondra tells her experience at Great Splendini, who is also Sid Waterman, the magician is stunned but decides to follow. The two would be P.I.s making an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman swims. Sondra, who fails she drowns, catches the attention of this hunk who wants to see more of her. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the two come in all sorts of fun situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the movie. Little believe the real Tarot killer that he can fool a determined Sondra, who turns out to be more resourceful than he gave her credit for. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie with many laughs that is just what to get out of the heat for a perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen has done better and yet this sunny comedy will claim him past mistakes. In "Scoop" Mr. Allen took care of the romantic leadership who pawer his beautiful leading lady. His trademark gesticulating is something this funny man will never get rid of as it appears to be his trademark. The movie has some fun liners that go over the heads of the viewers who may not be aware. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen. She plays the same part while Mr Allen does his shtick, a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their films throughout the film. Mrs. Johansson is a knockout beauty in her red swimsuit, although they have dressed her so stupid in most costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman a sophisticated man about the city with the right pedigree. He has a good look in the film as the man who pursues Mrs. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on his way to eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light film for the hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.
