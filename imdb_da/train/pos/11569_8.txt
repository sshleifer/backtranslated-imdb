Bob Clampett's 'An Itch in Time' milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he only scrapes himself again, he gets a feared bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it all but it is impossible to stop scratching. The comic is changing between the flea's progress inside the dog's coat and the dog's desperate attempt to cope with it. In a good order that really catches the frustration of a scratchy itching, the dog changes color from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it perfectly evokes the indescribable sense of an itch in a way that only Clampett could. There are several other elements that make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett. There is the grotesque concept in itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh. There is the uncontrolled violence that reacts to the head in every scene with the cat. It is especially the dirty jokes, including a giant shot of the dog's back that causes the flea to wolf flies and a hysterical sequence where the dog tries to scratch by pulling its backside along the floor. He immediately breaks to accommodate the audience: "Hi, I better cut it out. I like to like it!" With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make 'An Itch in Time' a unique, minutiae-based cartoon. As an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is practically nothing but fun with it.
