What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the author wants us to stick to at an early stage is our desire to know if Martinaud has done the dirty act. Without destroying so much, there is of course a red herring and a twist. But then we find that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulties in coping. When there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and provide for him, as as history progresses, we are made to believe that he is the sick, perverted pedophilia we are exposed to in mind. One of the things he has to do is the distant gap he and his wife have, even if they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, get their tendencies in the film's shocking final. <br /> <br /> This movie requires your patience, and it has certainly tried the restless teens sitting behind. They were stuck of course because they are not partial to "central location" movies. Although there are little trips when we get to the forest and the beach. And we realize that Gaul is not as clever as we are made to believe he is. The inquisitor is 5/5
