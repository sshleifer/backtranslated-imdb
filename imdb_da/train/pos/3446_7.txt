Yesterday I attended world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a good time. It was sold out and followed by all the great stars, including my fellow spacer Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 out of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can imagine the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. The photography in this movie was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become sweet. It looks like any other relationship at the beginning. The man is in search of the woman's attention and affection, and the woman is playing hard to get. Both played well. Very innocent flirt between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very dull and dark. They eventually end up in the basement, which is extremely dark and lit by many candles. This actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here's where he shows his true colors and continues to rape her. This is a very dark and gritty rapeseed scene. This scene is not for the young or the faint of heart. The rape scene is a bit long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows. <br /> <br /> Now, Maya is losing its soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts participating in the wildest of parties and wakes up in the morning in a room where you don't recall how she got there. She is told to see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I can remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone to save". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They start a dependency that comes to play later in the movie. The club scenes at this time of the film are photographed with extreme expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the photographer's director was applauded at the end of the show under the credits of the audience. <br /> <br /> Maya is back in college as a TA and who is in her class - Jared her arbitrator !! You could see the confusion and feelings on Maya's face. What should I do?? What should I do next ?? The shots in her face and the emotions are invaluable. <br /> <br /> What unfolds next is actually not what happens. She is interested in Jared. She seems to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweet again. I sat there saying that this could really happen. It wasn't. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> He invites him to his apartment and of course he shows himself. Now her apartment is dark and twig. She has him stripped down completely. He thinks he's going to be "lucky". She then corrects him as any woman can. She caresses him everywhere and he gets excited. Note: For anyone planning to watch this movie, this scene is full frontal nudity - perhaps not right for the younger viewer. She turns around and she becomes the animal and continues to rape Hello M. Once again, the scene is dark, greedy and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie and don't want to know what's next, skip this section and move on to the last section. <br /> <br /> This is where Adrian re-centers the image. Maya has Adrian save (?) Her performing extremely hard man with Jared. She thinks this is the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's crew and strip his dignity to nothing. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as trustworthy as anyone can. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and strength comes across the screen. After the film, Marcus explained during a Q&A session that this scene required great trust between him and Chad. Maya thinks this revenge will save her, but I don't think so. One of the final scenes has a close up of Mays face, and you see a tear roll down on the cheek. This was a fabulous closeup scene and continually evokes discussion from anyone going to watch this movie. Did she get revenge she wanted? Was it as satisfying as she expected ?? In my opinion, it does not. It only makes matters worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, will work roles, and I recommend it to anyone thinking of seeing it. I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be commended for the job well done. The Executive Board and the photography must also be praised. It was an evening I enjoyed.
