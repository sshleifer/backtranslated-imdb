Wonderland is the fascinating film that chronicles the involvement of the x-rated movie star John C. Holme in the brutal Wonderland murders. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the film misleads one to think of this as a romantic portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of Boogie Nights, and this is not the case here. In fact, with the exception of a few referrals from news agencies, John Holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of live recordings by John Holmes, this film is strictly dramatic about a fallen celebrity's engagement with murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite the deception, the film is actually engaging. The act of all cast is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is great in his ability to come down all the ways of John Moore. I was totally convinced that I was looking at what John C. Holmes probably looked and seemed like in reality. <br /> <br /> If you are John C. Holmes fan or stories of Hollywood I think you will enjoy seeing Wonderland.
