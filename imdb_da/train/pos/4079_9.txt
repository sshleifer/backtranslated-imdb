I first saw this movie when I was about 8 years old on television in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely loved it and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and the characters, but most of all the joking and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version that I saw - sometimes mistakenly referred to as "Streamline Dub" (dub was actually by Ghibli himself and only distributed by Streamline), which unfortunately is not available except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disk box-set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that the release has been partially spoiled by Disney. The voice action is OK, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy as "streamline" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They made some pointless changes, such as changing the protagonist's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu", adding some dialogue. But worst of all, I feel they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - for example, the airship's opening scene was silent, but has been spoiled by Dison's moronic claim that music plays when someone doesn't speak, which I find annoying at many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows the latest animated movies and I can't recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple but captivating, and the film shows a flair that unfortunately lacks from most modern mass market, homogenized animation.
