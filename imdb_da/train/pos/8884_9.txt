I really enjoyed the 60's. Not for that generation (I'm waiting for the '80s.) It was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> <br /> However, a major problem in the movie was how unbalanced the movie was in The family portrayal According to the promotion of NBC, the story was basically about two families struggling with problems in the 1960s America, now I may have missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the one African American Family I really believe that the 60s use music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the actor's mouth (which are all very talented.) This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours in) of the mini series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
