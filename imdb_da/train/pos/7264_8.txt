I agree with Cal-37 it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and sweet, of course, Jim Belushi has earned his strips! But if I really liked the piano song, if you are a musician or not watching this movie just for that, you will know which one it is.
