This is a nicely small crime drama that packs much in its 65-minute maturity. It has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired medieval cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his beginner sidekick Tobin (John Miles), a shady killer on the loose and equal love interest in Tobin in the form of a female botanist Mary ( Patricia Wright) who helps solve the crime. There is also a fantastic shoot-out finale that takes place in a stone-walled yard. <br /> <br /> Watch for a fantastic goof at the start of this movie, where Lt. Corrigan refers to the dead woman as 'Tatooed Tilly' BEFORE the author reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing huh?). Also later, when Tobin chases the killer over the back yards, he is suddenly shown in the wrong direction at some point - no wonder he didn't catch him!
