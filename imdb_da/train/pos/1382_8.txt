Not everything is said in this excellent first move from Céline Sciamma. The friendship, "who wants to fit in", the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated through synchronous swimming scenes. In any case, all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It's a much less violent approach to the understanding of teens compared to, "Thirteen" says, but a very worthy trip anyway. One must see and let all American film preparation be he dies. The audio track is A + by the way. <br /> <br /> Bon cinéma!
