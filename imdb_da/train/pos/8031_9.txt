This is a military drama I like a lot! Tom Berenger plays military killer Thomas Beckett. This Marine is non-nonsense, in your face, and no question is asked kind of person who gets the job done. There you have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) playing Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., working for the government and only taking orders from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I dont do that! When these two are paired, sparks must fly. And where. Beckett, however, teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other sniper frames, it's wits vs wits, cat vs mouse, gunman vs gunman. And when the spicy sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to set aside politics and save him. Who needs politics when you're a pro like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the policy. The movie was a direct hit. See it. Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
