This short movie trailer is pretty much about superman and Batman working together and forming a troubled alliance. Of course, the two characters have very different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. It is very fun to see these two iconic characters trying to get together. I don't want to go into the story here. But I want to get into the play, which is great. Everyone is well thrown. The two actors playing Superman and Batman are suitable for their characters. The same filmmakers made Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made this short film. Of the three I had probably liked this one at least, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the world's finest is a 7/10
