The basic hook here is: Lincoln is slow. It is his slowness that represents his thought and consideration, making him a great leader, involved here in a single hand civilization of the US border through the great legal instrument. All that, John Ford hooey and more, including a lurk slave and alien Death By Injun. However! The 'slow' objection is also at the heart of a brilliant piece of filmmaking, fun and moving in extremes. The story can be a bunk, but the story of it suggests a view of history as a process that inspires some exciting true visible moments. Check out Henry Fonda's great introductory stroll across the deck, his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river, his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch and the priceless business that follows "Mama, we must hurry!" We get to know the drama of the large courtroom, but Fonda is invaluable all the way through.
