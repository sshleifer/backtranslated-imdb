This is a real eyelid. A world made of floating islands and flying old cities. Huge monsters whose favorite attack method throws cathedrals against their opponents ... Who can resist it? An old prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero ... sound familiar ...? Yes, we heard it singing before. But you will forget it while looking at the spectacular landscape. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema you will long for a little more history. What is behind the 30-year-old? What drove the knight crazy? Who built all these amazing monuments, castles and cities ... and why do they fall apart? And apart from the one group of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so exciting, but it's not the Lord of the Rings.
