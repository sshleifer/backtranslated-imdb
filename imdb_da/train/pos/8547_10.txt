Many people hated this movie, but it is due to two facts - 1 - They want it too much like the first few American Pie movies. and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> This I found was the best of all six and I absolutely love Dwight. The reason is predictable, I want to say it, but what teenage comedy is not? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc. Etc. They are all incredibly predictable but still gooddamn fun! I say it's worth seeing, I love it, I find it fun. Just don't see it while comparing it to the first one because it's not the same. After seeing Naked Mile and this, it became obvious that all American Pie movies were on, and just about, the Staplers. Which is fine of me. <br /> <br /> See. Enjoy. Love. xD
