I'm writing this after just watching the perfect son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two foreign brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying of AIDS, they are embarking on a heart-warming reconciliation journey. The two leaders do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them while the film is progressing. However, I have a qualm about the film itself - while the brother who is dying seems ill, he does not look. A person of 0 T4 cells would look pretty sick - not even a makeup job to make the actor look sick was employed. A little grip, but one that makes it a little less realistic. In spite of one little gripe, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and you have the chance to see it. I hope for a DVD release in the near future!
