... in our household. Like everyone else who has commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4 years old) and I (10) would watch this movie again and again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always went back to this because of the great songs and the adventure. We all loved camel and would sing on top of our lungs with him during his song. There are some slow moments (time spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we were often bored with the knight's song ("The reason I sound} is because I loooooove you") but we loved the journey to save Babbette and the end and were all slightly confused by the image of King Koo-Koo who floating there dominating the entire horizon, laughing manic at the end. I'm still today to sing "Hooray for me! Babbette of Gay Paris!" around my friends (I am 33 now) who just looks at me as if I have lost my mind; But when I sing it, I am 10 years old again and remember the wonderful year Star Wars.
