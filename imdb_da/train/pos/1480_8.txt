I'm right now in front of the TV and looking at Casomai. It changes, it's evolving or better ... devolving. It begins with a wedding of the two main characters, where their love story is reported. Then everything changed by a child is changed and the rest is usually in a couple. It's not a special movie because it's talking about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. It won't show us anything special, there's nothing new, it's just a normal love story, a couple's story, and being normal will be different from the rest. It's also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is just a few seconds long. It's a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is central, meaning creates history, and destroys it. It's a simple story of a couple that I said, but it's not boring, it just shows a couple, it has to be everything it is, but I'm sure every one of you will know what's going on So don't forget to see the end!
