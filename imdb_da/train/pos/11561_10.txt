This hearty comedy confronts a few bizarre characters. Especially of course the two leading figures. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she could not keep her cleaning and cooking attacks anymore. So he tries to kill himself, but any attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, a bumpy, unreliable sports rep who lives in divorce from his former wife in a bachelor apartment. He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the trouble begins because two such contradictory characters cannot live together for a long time. Felix turns Oscar's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition surface. He cleans and boils all the time. After a short while, Oscar feels persecution ... Filmatised in a theatrical way and excellent act. Above all, Jack Lemmon's game is wonderful. He's the perfect clown. He makes us laugh, but in a tragic-comical way. Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbors to dinner because Oscar must touch something more softer than a bowling ball. While preparing drinks, Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he begins to talk about the weather. A moment later he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he begins to cry, and when Oscar returns with the drinks, there are three crying people in the living room. The film is full of so entertaining and at the same time touching scenes. An intelligent, entertaining comedy with a lot of heart. 10 out of 10!
