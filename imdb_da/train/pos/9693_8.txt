I was very surprised at this movie. I was touched by the lives that paulie moved along his way to find her "marie" the little girl he was divorced. The humor was also very good, and it didn't hurt in history as I thought it would do. In fact, I expected "paulie to have a cracker" jokes to hurt this movie, but even that was done in a very humorous scene that gets very touching when paulie is in the research lab press conference. So if you want to see a good "animal talking" movie, check this out much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well.
