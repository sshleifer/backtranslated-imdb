Wow, I forgot how big this movie was until I stumbled across it while looking through the garage. It's a strange combination of a movie by Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story of a superhero fighting to save some little kids. The vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment, where Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's just as weird). Joe Pesci is fun and has enough cool imagery and good music to entertain the whole! <br /> <br /> However, the real gem is the incredible "Smooth Criminal" video that makes the movie worth owning alone!
