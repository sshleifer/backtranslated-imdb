The second alternative Gundam universe story (G-Gundam is the first), the Gundam Wing is yet another view of the Gundam verse. The well-known elements exist, but the Gundam Wing is actually different from its counterparts. The biggest is Gundams is no more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In fact, the series does not really become a war war until episode 7, but in reality, the real conflict, Eve Wars, does not happen until the later episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest positives in this series are the characters. All the protagonists are full of 49 episode races, and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they put in. Another big plus is the amazing character of the series and mecha design. The designs shame some of the other Gundam colleagues. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is how many die hard UC fans claim to tear off the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is beyond me. True, there are many moments lifted, but their told in new ways, and there are also different differences. <br /> <br /> Take the usual comparison of Zech's Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more extinct in the Alliance and in ways OZ as well, while the Red Comet shone symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is that Zechs loses many soldiers under his command and thus the second nickname he has given in the early episodes: "Killer of his own men." Char has not received this label. <br /> <br /> The problem with this series is not the mumbo jumbo philosophy, but two problems. The first is the reused animation film of the Gundams attacks. Sure, it is fun to see Heavy Arms attack thoughts, MS and fly the first time. But fourth, scenes like this are being reused. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the entire series must take place over a whole year. If you really think about all the events that are in the series, a lot happens in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I suppose you can easily dismiss this fact when you ignore the intro's first lines every so often. As it stands, this is probably the best of the Gundam stories in alternative universes and a good introduction to the Gundam world. After all, it was the very first Gundam anime to fly in the American television.
