My name is heather and I am the girl whose story this movie was based on. I would like to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. As raw and tough as some of the things depicted in this film, it was not really even close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the impact that everything had on my mother and little sister. Thank you once again for the great comments everyone had, I really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It is hard to believe that so many years have passed since this film was made. Harder to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. For any of you out there who have gone through the same or similar kind of situation, you need to know that there are people in here in cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with every one of you.
