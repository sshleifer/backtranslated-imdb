This movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. It is rare that you come across such a heartbreaking flick, full of fun, laughter, heartache, and a little drama to keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> A true family movie, Homeward Bound, tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an effort to find their owners, follow the changes they make, and the obstacles They come along the road. One of the really amazing things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice is so good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, clever and brave, and seeing him try to save Sassy in the river was a very moving moment. Chance - Who wouldn't love a dog like Chance? He has to be the most embarrassed and lovable puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she sucked the goalkeeper; "Here kitty kitty kitty ... not on your life, chubby." <br /> <br /> There were also plenty of well-designed emotional scenes that Sassy walked over the waterfall (I was really scared of her), the shadow fell into the ditch (almost in tears) and saw the amazing end when all three pets returning home ... including good old shade! <br /> <br /> A favorite of all time - anyone who doesn't like this movie just doesn't like animals. Rent it or buy it now and it will leave you happy memories that will last in life.
