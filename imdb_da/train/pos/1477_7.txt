I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I didn't see the last scene (cos I talked to my brother m grandmother at the same time). Anyone can tell me what happened to her? I saw little that her husband heard someone talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door, she's already dead. What happened to her? Did she kill herself How could she arrange everything like the phone calls, meanwhile, she is at home when her husband spoke to this weird admirer? Anyone can explain to me, thank you. I am so so curious !! (In the end, I read that she suffered from Multiplication Disorder Personality). <br /> <br /> Lights before.
