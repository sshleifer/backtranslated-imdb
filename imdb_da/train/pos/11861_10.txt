This movie is very entertaining and is never boring, even running for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the movie and are very credible. Violence was a little extreme in the film, but then it turned out how vicious trafficking in drugs was at the time of the film. The end is fantastic and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movie and you will really enjoy it.
