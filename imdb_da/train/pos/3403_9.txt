Gorgeous Techicolor production tells the extraordinary tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious belief and a trappist monk who has left his monastery breaking his promises. The film is opened at a monastery in Europe, where a former student asks - a lonely beauty in black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is advised by her mother's superiors to go to the desert and "find herself" and lose her grief over her recently died father. In the train wagon heading into the Sahara, she is facing a very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. She is soon at a hotel near a palm-tree oasis where she again sees our mysterious restless man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted with a very seductive dance girl. Domini becomes friends with him but knows nothing about his past - romance soon to follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a little campy) - I found it to be quite fun and entertaining. The photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme facials and beautiful color images of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouetted figures against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a nicely done, but maintained, performance here and looks beautiful. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - is actually pretty good at this, I think that kind of fits him, and he also looks quite young and pretty. Basil Rathbone is fine here, except to give very little to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all, a very enjoyable movie.
