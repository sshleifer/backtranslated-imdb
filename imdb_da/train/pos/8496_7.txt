Wow, it's been years since I last watched this movie. Seeing it in 2008 is certainly different than seeing it in 1986. At first I didn't think about doing it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so uncomfortable, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to see him. He embodied any negative stereotype of the Americans. If it wasn't bad enough, it only got worse when the small American town's finest worker was shown. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese were presented as numb, robotic workaholics. The movie wasn't even fun, I just hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I continued the clock. <br /> <br /> Like boxing, judges are swayed by how you finish the round. This movie went from about three to seven, I rated it because of the finish. The end was excellent. You will always have a harmonious ending and it was just that. It was great that the city got to work and keep the factory, but the most special thing was the marriage of the Japanese customs and values ​​and the US customs and values. It was a mediocre movie ending in a high note.
