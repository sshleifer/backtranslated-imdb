Okay, it is needless to say that this movie will only appeal to a particular audience; namely stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> Having said that, if you are one of those people, this movie is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for main stores to sell a copy of it to anyone who buys their first bong. What Monty Python is Holy Grail is that geeks and geeks, then this movie is potheads. I first saw this movie 10 years ago or so, and I still jump up every time I see it. The papers fit perfectly with the pothead lifestyle, far better than last day knockoffs like Half-Baked's attempt. <br /> <br /> There is no plot so to speak; the film is more of a collection of different sketches; as the film's protagonists roam in Los Angeles in their legendary haze. In spite of this, the film has an excellent sense of pace and does not pull at all. Many people mention Up In Smoke as C & C's best work, but I have to say that Next Movie is superior. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the mood for an hour and half of the abdomen, light up, tune in and let your mind fly away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
