This is my favorite of the early Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40s. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set, slice one and shows the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons. Gags on this one are not all madcap Avery style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who has ever stayed late to watch scary movies (or radio shows)! Tom listens to a scary radio program, and Jerry decides to play a series of tricks to joke him. The nine-life gag is well done here, and I don't know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a scary sheet when I was a kid. When Tom the owner is awakened by ruckus-Mammy was NOT the girl, it was her house - she gets a heck of a surprise, with great grin. Get your break clear, it's worth it!
