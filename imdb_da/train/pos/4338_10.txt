The film was very moving. It was tender and fun at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand because of the story that her part had to be short, but I wish I could have seen more of her. She's a true pro. You will be able to remember experiences from your own life, hopefully in a positive way after watching this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Traveling on a Q and A after viewing. He is a wonderful man, wise, eloquent and a "real person". It was really an enjoyable evening! This is a must see movie. You will be so grateful you went.
