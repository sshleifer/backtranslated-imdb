An excellent documentary. I can even remember this growing up in NYC in the early 80s. This movie is for anyone who was not during this time period. This shows the only thing that African American Gay Underclass felt was exclusively theirs, and the love and camadrie you see is genuine. The people are real and unfortunately a few are still alive as this is being written. The balls are still kept, but not to the extent that they were in the nineties. That time is gone forever. This is a good pre "homo thug" movie. When Queens were really proud to be extroverts. Goodbye to Storyville this is another era gone by but much documented all hail movies!
