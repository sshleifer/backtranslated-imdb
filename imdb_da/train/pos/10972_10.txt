I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for years and has always been fascinated by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my favorite films. It is difficult to describe the incredible subject that Maysles discovered, but everything in it seems wonderful. It has so many memorable pictures and moments where you feel like you are entering a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and with the characters in it. It is as if the filmmakers have cast a spelling of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself because I could be away from it all, cooked my corn on cob by my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates all the way through. A fall from greatness to this unique family. The money had gone, but their air and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It took me from the first frame and long after the movie was finished, I found myself wondering about their fate. I wonder if I took a trip along East Hampton Beach, I can still hear Old Eie's voice at night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.
