I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s rather than as a story. Because there is no real story here. Only one vignette on top of another as small bright spots that do not mean much until you have enough to paint a picture. The first time I saw Chocolat, I didn't "get it" until I'd been thinking about it for a few days. Then I realized that there were many things to "get", including the end of colonialism, but around the corner, just no plot. Anyway, it's one of my all-time favorite movies. The scene at the airport with short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, don't look at this - you'll be bored with tears. But for some of you ... please thank me later to recommend it to you.
