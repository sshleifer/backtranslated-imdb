This was my second time watching the movie (via the French-language version as opposed to the first one being dubbed in Italian) and I feel that it improves upon subsequent viewing. <br /> <br /> A convincingly slow-built-up character survey that is beautifully shot and with the Parisian settings is just as impressive. In the long run, it's not first-class Polanski, and I would rank it at number 9 in his filmography, but it's still a safe mix of subtle chills and surprisingly often wide-ranging comedy. It also has a nice cast, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> However, I am somewhat confused by the sudden compulsion for Trelkovsky to "change" to the former renter except the owner of the cafe facing the apartment building where he is given what Simone used to have without asking him Whether he would have any different, there is little to indicate (as far as I could distinguish) anyway that this is what everyone wanted from him! Okay, so he found Simone's belongings still in the apartment, but what led him to wear his dresses and get up like her (although he apparently started doing this unconsciously)? After his nightmarish vision in the bathroom, the last part of the movie (where Adjani is constantly disappearing) is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene where landlord and other tenants testify to his attempt at suicide as if it were a night at the opera, concept that had already been used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! The end is then at once predictable and unresolved: what did the two residents of this particular occasion jump out of the window?!; I remember this factor bugging me on first impression as well and I'm sorry to say it's not clearer now! Remember that the film's first two-thirds are quite solid, but I want Polanski to have been less dependent on unclear plot points throughout.
