When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magical ring from his uncle, the wizard examines Gandalf and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. Should the ring end up in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends were trying to destroy the ring with a war band. This is an underestimated adaptation of the classic novels as it covers only the first half of the story. Whether this is an epic and wonderful animated movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazingly made with rotoskop, which tracks live action footage. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he got. The movie also boasts a grand music score by Leonard Rosenman that fits all scenes. There are a few plot holes with the script, but it has to be apologized, considering the original deal was to make the book logotype two films that had to be crammed in the first. My biggest gripe is something of the drawn design, Samwise was a little too greasy, while the other hobbits seem quite normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a good job, I was glad Legolas is actually a bit more useful to the plot. The rotoscopic orcs are more comical than scary, while ringwraiths are scary and nightmarish. Another problem is that the evil guide Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the authors. All in all, I think a little more money and better writers would have done this much justice, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi made a brave effort to make screen customization of these classic stories. The movie is terribly suffering from being overshadowed by the live action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
