It looks like Hal Hartley's movie is kind of hit or miss with most audiences. This movie is no exception to this rule. Fay Grim works as a successor to Hartley's 'Henry Foole' of 1998. This time, the focus is on Hrin's former wife (played perfect for the thoughtful Parker Posey) who is hit by the CIA goons about Henry's unpublished book on all his shady relationships. Meanwhile, of all this, Fay ends in an odyssey dealing with international spies, etc. The film is slightly weakened in the second half. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is one that must not be missed. For the beginner's first timer, who has only heard of his filmmaking technique, you may want to see his previous films before you take on this (especially if you haven't seen 'Henry' yet). I admired the camera work, which at times reminded me of some early Man Ray photography.
