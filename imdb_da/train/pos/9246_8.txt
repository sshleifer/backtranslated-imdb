One of the great mysteries of life that suffers from everyday life is therefore that fine girls so often are more interested in jerks and heels than in the lovely guys. Worse, when the nice guys will even marry these girls, the girls still prefer jerks and heels, even after jerks and heels have shown their contempt, they have shown that they are just interested in using the girls. Stu Erwin is the lovely guy who continues to be nice after lying and cheating and even after losing the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is shaking and he is perfect in the role, rather a sad note to his fans. Jean Harlow comes across as a more slender Mae West, which even looks like La West in some of its cynical throwaway lines. Something strange is that so many of the other characters, It was supposed to be bad - I mean they are unlocked so they have to be - are so nice people, of course. In fact, there are many nice people here, people who, in a smaller r movie or story, would be snarling and back-stabbing, but here go out of their way to help someone else. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the story is pretty clich√©d, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be happy to have seen. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors don't get credit. Once again we can say a nice "thank you" to IMDb.com.
