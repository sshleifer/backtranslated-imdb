This murder mystery with music tracks is long on atmosphere and character, but rather short on excitement and plausibility. Based on a stage play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a whodunit plot with a backstage atmosphere (a murder investigation taking place on the opening night at the theater where a musical revival is staged). <br /> <br /> The shock is impressive and varied: Victorious Victor McLaglen as a police officer who conducts the investigation and never fails to learn idiotically, no matter which showgirl happens to be in sight Jack Oakie (former warlord Jack Lemmon? was Jack Lemmon's postwar Jack Oakie?) As the harassed instructor, who has to coordinate the staged performance and the chaos behind the scenes; the eternally homely Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe holder with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has a stunning close-up monologue near the end, which the slender girl is in love with the male lead; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as the very male management who warbling the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operationally delivering "Where do they come from and where do they go" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; the lovely Gertrude Michael, who was separated from us early as a medieval showgirl whose love of Brisson is spurned; the usually ridiculous Toby Wing, which here is at least the center of a laugh that is constantly joking. When the plot complications come out of hand, there is always an interesting executive or fun and tunefult musical number to distract the viewer. The movie's most famous sequence is the "Marahuana" number, led by Michaels, but apart from its controversial history, it is truly one of the lesser musical offerings. All the songs here are staged as though they could actually fit into a standard proscenium theater room, as opposed to the cinematic fantasy setting of the Busby Berkeley style.
