This 1939 movie tried to exploit the much better Michael Curtiz movie "Angels with Dirty Faces". As stated by Ray Enright, it is only interesting how tame these children were in comparison to what is happening to the youth of America's inner cities today. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing only because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired. The Dead End children have larger parts as the plot focuses on them rather than in the older people. In a way, it is curious how the fuel was used in the same way some careful homeowners did in recent years right here in New York. It was the fastest way to turn a property around, never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many weapons around there is a new reality. The young youth in history just seemed pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!
