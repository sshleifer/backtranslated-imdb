Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flips where she is told by the local professor type that she has power - he tries to get her to read Nietzche - she says books have not been done for her. The son we find out that her father is basically pimping her out to a local politician and others. Finally, she has had enough and moved to the big city. We follow her path of men up for the increase for success in an international bank. The dialogue is pretty sad at the moment, and it was a last movie to come out before the confidence-induced Hollywood production code. Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwy's willing victims. Couple of Forbidden Hollywood collection - I saw the extended version - the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge.An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatal roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir.
