I went and saw rivers and tides again today. It's the second time in two days, and yes, I watch movies I like as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the glimpse of the picture and Goldsworthy's works. This morning, when I threw the coins, I got # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. I received the 5th line that changed, which moved to # 7 Army. To Blake Art was a war. Still, I knew I had to watch the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few reviews that existed online from the SF Examiner. The critic loved the movie, but said Goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the movie. He would rather only have the pictures and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware of what I saw this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as the world king. Nowadays, I could get a little beyond the pictures and listen to what he had to say. Can I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he does, he says far beyond "art". His understanding of water, time, stone, change, and again and again made me believe that the man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his work / words are Zen like. His knowledge ... Yet, the film is only (apparently) shown here in the Bay Area. Be a trendsetter. Go to your local cinema and tell them not to insist on ordering a movie you've heard from the hinterland. It's called rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
