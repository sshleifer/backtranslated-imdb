The story of "A woman from nowhere" is pretty simple and pretty much aligned right out of an Eastwood Spaghetti Western: A mysterious stranger enters a lawless city run by a kingpin and starts shooting up on the spot. Even opening credits and music has this spaghetti feel: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the location is in a city somewhere in Japan. In this action, there is a significant amount of gunplay, some of the good, some predictable, and others spotting something hokey, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko handles his weapons with credibility and aplomb and blames the bitches. It was not much of a challenging challenge for her as it was a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. She shows her acting experiences much more like Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi." I would highly recommend movies if you are a Ryoko Yonekura fan (as I am adoringly) and / or a "girls with weapons" movie fan and it stops repetitive prospects. For me, there is something strange and inexplicably appealing to "girls with weapons" films such as "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight." And to have a beautiful gal like Ryoko in it then just gobs of icing on the cake.
