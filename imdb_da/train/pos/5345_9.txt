Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is once again moving towards political confrontation. Therefore, this masterpiece must be displayed in all Spanish high schools. It is a huge lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. The American pilot who becomes involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe has ever made. The colors are magnificent. A cruelty of war (can anyone tell me the difference between any war and a civil war?) Used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards that start their abuse of power even against innocent children are now active again. A film like 'El viaje de Carol' / 'Carol's Journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century. It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again fantastic work from the Iberica peninsula!
