Okay, it was a pretty marvelous episode. Much better than the credit it receives. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is great. Best yet. I love the last shot. The atmosphere is great, the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about this episode is that many things left unexplained. Why does it change sex? what is the purpose? and they are foreigners? what kind? Why were they never shown again in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode high three stars. One of my favorites yet, but the plot holes bother me. Still ... it won't ruin my entertainment.
