This series got me into Deighton's writing and the genre when I was younger, and I love this presentation of the story. However, I would disagree with the above comment. From what I've read in the past, it's not Holm's performance that leads Deighton to refuse to get the series released, but the slaughterhouse that all three books received in the translation to the screen. A good example of this is the rewrite of the crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character that dies in the minefield was never in any of the books, and the cross in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. This whole story is cloth. The changes in Set also damage the integrity of history. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed Samson's disorientation during his wife's defeat excellently, and I think he compensated well for portraying the aging field agent who desperately tried to overclassify. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers because of its influence on his life. As Clevemore commented, he had received an education, he would probably have run the department. I think the real loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything else. Holm is diminutive compared to the book's son-in-law - a physically impressive man able to use his size to impose a presence.
