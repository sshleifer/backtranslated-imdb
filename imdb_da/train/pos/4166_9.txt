Before Cujo there was Lucky the devil's dog. In 1978, the film "Devil Dog, Hell's Hound" premiered on Halloween Night. A story about a family that gets a new puppy (from a farmer who just happens to be in the neighborhood selling fruit and vegetables) because their dog skipper was killed. Consent? Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> It is not long before father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, where Boys's, Jackson County Prison, Snowbeast) is different and his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff- Turf) has also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to find out and do everything needed to save his family. This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim who play a darker side of themselves than we saw on these witchcraft movies. This is one of the many 70's custom-made movie TVs that were actually scary for a TV-tailored movie. The music was scary and even the end that I will not tell made you think. <br /> <br /> This movie is also the stars Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who couldn't stay away from the devil's movie remembers "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
