NIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> The Hitchcockian suspender gives Williams a stand-out key feature. <br /> <br /> What about celebrities and fans? What is the close paranoia you associate with the other, and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the most recent event-based scenario based on true events, the Williams stars remind you as a talk-radio personality called Gabriel No, who reads stories he has written over airwaves and has accumulated a Interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin), who has submitted a manuscript about the bustle of busy youths to Ingen's editor Ashe (Morton), which gives it to Nobody to read for himself. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally disturbed, but ultimately fascinated by the nightmarish existence of Pete who was abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette gives an excellent achievement) who has adopted a boy, but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete dies of AIDS. Of course, no one wants to meet the fans, but is suddenly in doubt about their possibly incredible backgrounds when the seed is planted by its alien boyfriend Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin who has only now grown into a storm in a teapot when he decides to examine in Donna and Pete's backgrounds to discover some truths he had not expected. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who wrote the play with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's novice director Stettner) and based on a true story of a fan hoax found out, some Hitchcockian moments are in full swing tilt like any good old fashioned kettle does. It helps Williams give a stand-out, low key feature like the contradictory kind-hearted personality who really wants to believe his number one fan is actually genuine and loves him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some Disturbingly dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned, but emphasize the desperation of her character who can rattle you to the core. <br /> <br /> But the movie runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a fine-tuned piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: Beware of what you hope on.
