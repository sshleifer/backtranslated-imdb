Ride with the Devil, like Ang Lee's later Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Film lovers should see it at least twice as its artistic nuance is worth understanding. <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, so will catch you, will change your existing notion of history and politics, will restore your faith in humanity. After seeing so many killings, so many ailments, you do not feel numb, instead you tax more the bond between people. The actors' performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. Some shots are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves and become the vision of the soul. Such is the true feeling that movies are a genre of art. <br /> <br /> A movie like this doesn't need long comments or reviews, all it says by itself. Ovation to the cast, which includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what a performance!
