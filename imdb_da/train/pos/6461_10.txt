First, I was completely protected by the film's introductory poem, and then I became completely enchanted with the unfolding story and engaged with the glorious rule. The characters were all fully developed, no bigger than life, but just like the people we live in where we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all absolutely credible people with foibles and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful movie. It shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind each action to bring the whole theme clear and bright, and it shows the director's glimpse! Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this amazing treat !!
