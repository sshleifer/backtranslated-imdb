As is well known, anthology films don't go very well with American audiences (I assume they prefer a standard plot line). New York, I love you, is the second phase of a series of anthology profiles dealing with cities and the people who live and love them. The first was 'Paris, J'Taime', which I really enjoyed. The film consisted of several segments, each written and / or directed by another director (most of whom were French, but there is a very fun segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like 'Paris', this is also an anthology controlled by several directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.) And also as' Paris'deals with New Yorkers and why they love the city, they live i. It has a top notch cast that includes Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and also have seasonal veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly and others don't (though I suppose it will depend on individual tastes --- I won't ruin it for anyone else by revealing which ones worked for me and which didn't). Word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (are Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece outside the question?). Spoken mainly in English but has bits of Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated 'R'af MPAA for strong language and sexual content
