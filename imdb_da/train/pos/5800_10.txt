This is far from my most favorite movie in the world !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 and I still enjoy it at 16 !! It's an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoy every second of it, and not only does the movie have any great special influences, but it sends a big message to the young people in the audience who may sound like sheesy, but in reality the movie is made very COOLY indeed! Although Michael Jackson has been in avew movies now, people still don't see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is amazing !!! MOONWALKER IS A MUST SEE !!!!!!
