When I read the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics, I hesitate to admit how much I love this movie, even though I only have a dubbed-in-Japanese video version of it. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to take it as a minus that the premise of history has been used before, most famous in the very big "It's a wonderful life." For me, a good premise is a great prerequisite, no matter how many times it is used, and I would like to see more movies using this particular premise - the disgruntled man who gets a chance to get a new perspective on his own life through a little "divine magic". I suppose people and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as drawn into the story, but I do not go to movies to criticize them with notebook in hand - I go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they want. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental like myself, you will be rewarded by seeing this image. The performances are excellent throughout and the movie was very well thrown. Wonderful choice of music too. Michael Caine is wonderful as the sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi does a good job as an "average Joe" kind of guy wondering if his life hasn't gone as it should. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again right on target here as the loving wife. Jon Lovitz entertaines as usual and even has some surprisingly moving moments in "Mr. Destiny." No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life," but who says it should be? Taken on its own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is an enjoyable, well-crafted, fun and moving movie. I've seen my Japanese-dubbed video of it many times and I'm sure I'll see it several times. If it somehow makes me a "lowbrow", be it! I'm just glad I didn't read any reviews of "Mr. Destiny" until you saw it. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should have the courage of my beliefs and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I couldn't help but doubt having read all the critical reviews!
