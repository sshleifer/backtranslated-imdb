I thought Baseketball was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen! It's witty humor that has made me giggle all the way through, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so over the top, increases the movie's comedy. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies where you'd never get tired of seeing it. I have a very short attention span, and I think this movie has some fun bits as it keeps me entertained all the way through. The humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later. So generally, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, especially if you are younger than me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards. <br /> <br /> P.s Does it seem strange to me to like both of them? hehe
