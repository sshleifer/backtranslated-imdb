You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the news will probably not be worn on the first, second, or third view, but you will be drawn to the characters so simple yet exciting that you might find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish because of the medium. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to hold the title "Biggest Animation in the World" with "A Bug's Life" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments is the lovely "out-take" added to the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of these sockets, where as I have told the VHS cassette, there is an alternating version per. Ribbon. The DVD also contains "Gerry's Game", which is a nice little PIXAR card that was also shown before the movie in theaters. This is by far the superior insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the history development and the characters. If you look at both films' star voices, "Antz" is basically cast with big names "movie stars" with a couple of known "TV" star voices, where "A Bug's Life" is just opposite, loaded with "TV" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only one stands out exception. But the difference in quality is clear and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks cannot be blamed or surprised, but when you head to Disney, you have your work cut out for you. This is the kind of movie that almost makes me wish I had kids to share it with. Don't think for a second that this is just a movie for children.
