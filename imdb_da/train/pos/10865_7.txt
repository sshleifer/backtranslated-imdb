This movie is fun to watch if you love movies of organized crime. Those looking for a crime film with a charismatic leadership with dreams of taking over in a bad way can be a little disappointed with the way this film progresses. <br /> <br /> It is a fun reel through a criminal underworld though and if you are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this. I was a little disappointed by some of the choices that were made historically, but generally a good crime film. Some things weren't sensible, but it seems to be the norm with films from the East. <br /> <br /> People randomly do things no matter how their personalities were created earlier. It is a slightly annoying pattern that permeates itself in this movie.
