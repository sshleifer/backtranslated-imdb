As has been documented by previous posters, Rockstar: INXS is the real star - and it's the sequel Rockstar: Supernova - Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton, and Sasha Krivtsov. Don't know who they are? They are the amazing, tight rockin 'house band whose musical science and talent made this something more than a sad American idol clone. Remember "strings" at night? It was musical precision and perfection if I ever saw it. Suzie McNeil's epic rendition of the Queen's' Bohemian Rhapsody ', Ty Taylor's memorable cover of Stones'' You Can Not Always Get ... ', JD Fortune sings "Suspicious Minds". The common denominator here is the amazing House Band. Almost INXS was in their prime, they are unfortunately a shadow of their previous self, even though JD's live performance has had some new life in their music, this show is about HB. <br /> <br /> Memo for producers: Season three (if we are blessed enough to make it happen) must be the Rockstar: House Band. Get these boys into a good lead and they go to places.
