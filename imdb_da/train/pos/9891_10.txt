I first rented this movie many years ago and was totally excited about it. Recently, I have felt a strange need to revise some of the too few movies that I have had tremendously in life, I decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I'm glad I did it when I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not at least drained the skin of this movie. The story is about a teenaged girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder!), Who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion, after which grandmother is playing purely hypnotic by Irene Papas, forcing the girl to a prostitution life on the road to repay the damage. <br /> <br /> The display is at once fascinating and convincing - though tastefully void of free steaming sexual content, despite the basic premise of prostitution. The story is more about the interaction between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters they come into contact with during their stay - which, incidentally, are in the rough and tumbling part of rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The movie is very atmospheric, arresting enigmas with a particular dream-like quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not on the point, says a David Lynch movie. It is also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments of previous viewers under ... <br /> <br /> Often in the background you hear the sound of a lonely accordion, quiet and melancholy, and adds just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The rural film, many of which are in the desert, is amazing. The movie moves at a good pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after each scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it again just because it made you do it. For me it is nevertheless the convincing one. Hopefully you will see the movie in its Spanish language version with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school and college, and I was happy to understand much of the dialogue. For example: "No need to grab a comma pensioner." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - it's a small world.) <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me to stumble upon a dusty old bottle of wine, which by drinking is extremely satisfying, yet Are you back with some grief by realizing that there are no more bottles like this.
