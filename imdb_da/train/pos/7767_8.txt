Stack should have received the Academy Award for this performance period. It's a crime he didn't do. Great how he humanizes a rich worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone earned a well-deserved Academy Award for her achievements. In fact, all that works in this movie is excellent. <br /> <br /> The reason begins with a taxi ride, then a flying trip, so continue to move on an emotional ride that keeps your interest all the way through. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> But this is only an obvious soap opera. One-dimensional, 100 percent soaps. You can call it the ultimate sleep, because the play so thoroughly triumphs over the material. Well acted, well directed, but strictly within its soap genre. I wouldn't even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). While you do not deny the great entertainment value of this movie, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with a wider subject.
