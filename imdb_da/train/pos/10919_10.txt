Five Deadly Venoms are not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it contains some of the best hand-to-hand fighting sequences in Hong Kong's film history. Director Chang Cheh creates what many consider to be his masterpiece. This film launched a career with the five men who play the poison. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. He would continue to be in Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, Philip Kwok, would continue with Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any chop socky fan can apperciate this. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But everything chop socky is good and it is one of the very best.
