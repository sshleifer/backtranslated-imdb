I was pleasantly surprised to find out how to lose friends and alienate people was not as close as "widespread" to a comedy that the trailer had made me expect. I was quickly absorbed in the unfolding of the story and remained immersed everywhere. The pacing of the more visual humorous content was, I thought, spot on. (I think I got the impression I experienced Pegg's attempt to restore lost control much "in real time." At other times, there was time to share the main character's (ie, Pegg's and Duns) reflection on how events affect them, and what led them to where they were now. All the characters were well thrown, to some extent interesting in themselves and generally very pleasant. (Any seemingly ruthless ambition turned out to be temperate by a similarly good natural resilience.) An entertaining , intelligent scripted, brilliantly directed and superbly acted movies that I would thoroughly recommend.
