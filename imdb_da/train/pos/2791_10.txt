This is one of my all-time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite films (mental list, mind), the only ones that are in the same context are films like The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. I can really relate to the protagonist Jess. At the start of the film, she is a shy girl with a somewhat strange background, who has many more friends who are boys than girls. She really sucks you in her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's plays, or anyone else's movie. <br /> <br /> The football was interesting to see even for someone like me who has no idea of ​​the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really sweet and didn't make me blush too much! One thing that really did was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indian and there are many colorful Indian conventions throughout the film that provide a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also fun! In essence, it is a movie in the future where you choose the path you want and fight for it. <br /> <br /> Feeling good comedies become my favorite movie genre thanks to this movie. They are fun, they are refreshing and they make you feel good! ^ _ ~
