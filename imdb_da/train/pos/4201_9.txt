Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by film maverick Samuel Fuller, features a stunning opening that creates a double complication. Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) collides with the pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool). She does not realize that she is wearing valuable microfilm; McCoy is unaware of the gossip. Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. Thus, moving in motion sets a degree of knowledges. Candy is double sown (Ship and police) and therefore double naive; Ships, the persuasive petty thief, are uniquely ignorant, drawn by federal agents; Feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless. They cannot stop "transient" of state secrets or the spread of communism.
