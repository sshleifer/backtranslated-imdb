I don't think most of us would tend to use the term "must-see" for action movies, but I was very impressed with how good this movie was and it deserves the "must-see" profit from me. Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of late Brandon Lee), is recruited by Martin, a professional thief who helps pull a diamond heart into a criminal syndicate museum and get rewarded well for it. Little do they know that another couple of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a few lovebirds) who were previously asked by Mandy and Martin to enter the deal are also planning to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> How each couple of twenty planes the horse is a thrill to see. Things go wrong when Martin and Mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate, which is not at all happy that the diamond is not in their hands. Action fans will not be disappointed as there is a healthy dose of gunfights, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. It is surprising, not only the action that carries this movie, but the romance and the laughs (and I don't mean yours) Typical one-line lines that dominate in action movies) sneak in. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to mess with evil, but we're going to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and a NOT to be missed! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
