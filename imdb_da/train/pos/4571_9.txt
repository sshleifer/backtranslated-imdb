The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor such as Christy Brown, guinea's artist and fighter, who, despite her physical condition, overcame all odds. As a person working with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was shockingly convincing. The enormous support Christy got to form his family, low income, working class Dublin, urged him to do the impossible, and this image depicted this support, brilliant has not read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty, arrogant personality. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie lovers.
