Not a bad movie. Somehow I was made to root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie, even though I don't know about football and not fan. The end of the bus was exciting. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they should not enter into sporting arenas among men because their swarms are inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women are trying to sneak in, but many are being caught and detained. It is truly amazing that any society could still have such antique gender concepts. Panahi says in an interview that his films are stories and its injustices and that one day in the future we can see these movies and see how Iran once lived. It is hoped that the future will come rather than later.
