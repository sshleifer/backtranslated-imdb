A Damsel in Distress is a pleasure because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a great support cast with Gracie Allen and George Burns. Normally, a stupid plot for an Astaire movie is like an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen's secretary. They tell a story that he is a love error with women who fall victim to him to the left and right. He enters Fontaine, who is held captive in his castle by a dominant aunt and rich father. Silly plot. The big songs include a foggy day, things look up, nice work if you can get it, and I can't be bothered now. Fontaine does not sing, but does a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in a few dance tales with Astaire is Burns and Allen, including an inventive and fun drum through an amusement park. Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (like Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the leading madrigal singer. Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio that sings Nice Work if you can get it. Her facial expressions are fun. She was also a stage speaker in W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, plays Cleopatra Pepperday. Many abuses have been hit on this movie because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as mentioned elsewhere, would have been hidden in disgust. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes. Two more would be disasters. Fontaine is fine as Alyce, and the dynamic allows musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with lots of comic relief from Burns and Allen. Fun movie, good songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!
