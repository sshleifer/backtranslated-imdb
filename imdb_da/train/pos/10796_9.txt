If you're a fan of either or both Chuck Norris & Judson Mills then it's the movie to watch. It has a lot of adventure in it. It is a great follow-up to the President's husband. Chemistry between the main three stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. My personal opinion. This movie along with the original has proven so good that the network should consider converting it into a regular series. If you've seen the president's husband, I recommend this movie to you. If you've seen the president's husband: A line in the sand, but you haven't seen the president's husband, let me suggest that you do. You will not be disappointed with one.
