I just watched this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where it played during the Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth was the only reason I went to this movie because it shared its name with the Radiohead song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so I really didn't have the choice: -You went in expecting it was something like the silence of the lamb, but it turned out to be semi-gore flick. Someone has already mentioned that none of the signs are sympathetic and that is quite correct. I really couldn't break my mind if Potent's character got her intestines torn out of Creep. I rowed for the homeless to make it alive with Potente's character, who just got her desserts. Christopher Smith has certainly done a good job on the film's visual aspect. However, the story is rather weak, but then it was the whole meaning of the movie scaring you out of it, and it made it quite effective. The result of a Bristol band called The Insects was top notch. It was more than anything else that really scared the crap out of me. <br /> <br /> The director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the Q&A session. I really hope he gets better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> This one is strictly for gene refinements, but I would recommend non-fans to give it a try anyway. It was a fun trip.
