I spent 5 hours drenched in this movie. Nothing I've ever seen comes close to the delicious funk, this movie left me. Never mind female advanced aging diaphragms, human scales from the screen for viewing. Personally engaging in ninth degree, the film invests one with an undeniable common sense for our lives'. I enjoyed this dalliance with raw wound mad deep from the inside. It provides a mutually divided west in the history of human encounters that reach far deeper into pain, isolation, and skewed view of themselves and others. The result forgives our lukewarm formation of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter. The birth of finding real people is a happy pursuit. Efforts for realism cut with the dark reason of our bankruptcy culture.
