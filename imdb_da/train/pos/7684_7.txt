Reading all comments is very exciting. But can anyone tell me the name of the real artist who painted the pictures for the good broadcasts. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as an artist in the family, but there was a real family who has the right artist and he has not yet received any credit in this view. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist, I would also like to tell him "job well done". I know that this view is for the good times cast, but would you not agree that he also touched the hearts of all of us. I want to know if he is still painting or if he is still alive. I want some of his work shown in my home.
