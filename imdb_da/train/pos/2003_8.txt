The main problem with the first "Vampires" film is that none of the characters were sympathetic. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a sympathetic vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is definitely the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't Carpenter spend more of this ??) this movie is not nearly as good as it could have been. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least a prolonged nicely choreographed battle sequence (for example in a city) and was a little disappointed. While "Los Muertos" continues at a higher pace than its predecessor, it still draws a bit in some parts (although nowhere as bad as "Vampires" did). Much like "Vampires", but this movie's climax at the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it's certainly not. It's generally fun and ranks among the better entrances to the genre. It is also not an unoriginal Dracula remake (like almost any other vampire movie out there), nor is it an unintelligible play like Blade II. It could just have used a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I really want to see a third installment made by Carpenter, but it won't happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING The end was too predictable. Una should have been gone - it would have made the movie quite unusual.
