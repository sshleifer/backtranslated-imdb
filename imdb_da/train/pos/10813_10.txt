I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters whose autobiography I now read. I admit that my jaw has fallen when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in, but people can't look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece. It is pretty much a short film made of black, for black at a time when the entertainment industry was quite separate and the stereotypes of the people involved were the jokes of their time, old tendencies exaggerated for humor. We see that modern black films do the same, but with the new trends (stereotypes), "ho's" and "hood" and so on. I think if you look back for 80 years, you would find today's movies look just like racist. What the viewers should appreciate this movie is Waters talent and the pint-sized Sammy Davis Jr., who exits his modern Shirley Temple and looks remarkably the same as he did as an adult. Everyone involved in this movie obviously had a lot of fun doing it. Why not enjoy it for what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?
