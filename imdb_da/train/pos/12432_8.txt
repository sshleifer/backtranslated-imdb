I expect this is the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, so I left it uncut for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a series of stupid gunfights and car / boat chases, it was an almost thought-provoking analysis of how a beautiful girl gets as hard as nails, where nothing is exaggerated or rationalized. It is likely that budget constraints that actually helped with it: less time and effort was spent on finding stupid ways for stunt men to die, and more were dedicated to making the movie worth seeing. Hell, the biggest gun battle going off screen - and the scene where it is heard is the better for the background noise that adds excitement - who wins? Who dies? <br /> <br /> The Alexandra City may not be as deadly as Monica Vitti, but few are and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire needed to make the character work - and form of her face, her hair and her tall, slender body could have been lifted directly from the cartoon graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise asked guy in that he made the sign interesting and enjoyable - as well (and I doubt I would consider taking on many brutal , psychopathic killers as companions). I can't think of a single Hollywood's "former servant" who might have pulled the role away from it. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Blaise's evil always dies (no spoilers there!) It's a really good thing for all the girls who would have spent their time swimming over such an eerily beautiful and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes.
