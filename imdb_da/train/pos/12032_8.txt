The film, which I will be reviewing, is a small television film made in 1996, and it was Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels pressured by having such a controlling father (Baldwin). But when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Been Kissed"), they instantly fall into each other, but Jennifer has another idea of ​​where to take their relationship. She manipulates him to kill his parents to protect their 'love', but she just used him to get rid of the parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher's future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator, and she wears the film well using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the support molding works well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released that year, Hart, began to portray Sabrina, Teenage Witch, and this shows that she can trade in my genres of film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the movie has dated something, it is quiet as some of her best work involving drama or thriller, and I'm looking forward to "Nine Dead" coming out in November because it shows that she can be seen as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. Internet so I suggest checking it out.
