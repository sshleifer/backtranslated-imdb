The Ladies Man laughs a lot of fun, with a great variety of cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is his usual quality even in a brilliant side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there. It is definitely worth a purchase as seeing it every six months or so will cause you to still laugh as hard as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> I am aggrieved to think about the time to write this that it has a poor 4.7 / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> Remember the kids "there is more movement in the sea"
