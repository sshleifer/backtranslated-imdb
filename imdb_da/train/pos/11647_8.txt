I can give you four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers in the modern Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four great stories related to a great scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good molding. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problems in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comical mood about the authority that exerts the extortion against ordinary people and still expects to be appreciated by its efforts. <br /> <br /> As Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece with a story, he inherits the Italian neorealism with a "Peter and Wolf" -like anecdote. In the third story, the one that seems more independent of this series, even in the context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story that a man is in the wrong place at the wrong moment. But after the recent lynching on Tlahuac and the tradition of this terrible case in the state of Mexico, this story could not be updated. <br /> <br /> Finally, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor of the "grand finale", where he puts most of the characters from the previous sequences into one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed . Repeating the Centre's scene from one of his earlier films "Todo el poder", gives Sariñana the last lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti, and make a short striptease. <br /> <br /> Once the movie is finished, you get a bittersweet feeling of watching a good movie (and maybe enjoying it) with a very painful topic. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example. This film is a testimony to how Mexicans have learned to live in the midst of a crime state (and perhaps accepted it), between two fires: The criminals and the so-called authorities are full of corruption. Even this movie is a wish-seeking because almost all the good people have been victims of crime and they do not get this unheard of. If you had an attack without a scratch, then you're lucky. In the meantime, you won't lose the chance to watch this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
