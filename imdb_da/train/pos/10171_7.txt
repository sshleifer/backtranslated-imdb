Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet poster that said "ne boltay!", Which means "not gossip!". I "translated" it into "generation" of television viewers as "Don't be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the nosy neighbor on "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> But when you see the result of gossip in Pvt. Snafu short "rumors", you see it is no laugh. In this case, the persistent innocent soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axial powers have attacked the United States. Then he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues. As in "the Russians come, the Russians come" the story is blown more and more out of proportion every time, so when it comes back to Snafu ... well you know what I mean! Yes, it is mostly WWII propaganda - complete with a derogatory expression of the Japanese - but I have to say that Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite fun. Of course, when they had Dr. Seuss writing and Mel Blanc give the votes, it is of course no surprise that these came out pretty cool. Worth to see.
