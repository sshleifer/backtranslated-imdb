The actors have chosen the best people for the job and put the scene wonderfully. Each interior is full of details that tell you all about the people living in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) to the Middle Ages or the 1910s (the latter), costumes and attitudes, has been lovingly observed and created. I love the two old ladies in the hard sanatorium, the boring costumes - exquisite lace covered by the finest Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as the Ashenden is very appealing, but do not forget the sweet young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the man who regains his wife's health and independence that harrows our feelings. He usually played comic, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (big 30s movie starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from Mr Know All episode (and also nicked a story of Kipling). I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous man - even though he has a good moment watching melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love the crazy bird playing his wife too.
