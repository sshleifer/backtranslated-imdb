I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite Vietnam war movie is The Deer Hunter. The deer hunter focused on part of the war and then focused on life before the war. This film is basically Deer Hunter 2. The scripture is too loose in relation to the deer hunter. The story has never been developed to the point that the audience can really understand and feel the characters that Deerhunter did. Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as those in Deerhunter. Therefore, I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> But I think the play was excellent. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great fear of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in battle. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the blame he has in Bobby, losing his life and trying to save his. <br /> <br /> I also like the supportive cast. Everyone in town is part of the movie. Of course, the city can't handle Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns, it's about being quiet, humble and thinking about your business. However, Harris's character cannot be any of these. It is interesting how war affects people. Some people rebound quickly while others never recover.
