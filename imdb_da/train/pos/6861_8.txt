When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the 80s to what passes for entertainment today, his movies look better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all fantastic works by a filmmaker on top of his powers. The guy had a lot better than average movies. This is pure Hitchcock with an 80's dash lurid perversion, a lovingly told tale of lust and murder with lots of twists, great styles, a stunning Pino Donaggio score and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. De Palma's love of complex camera work and delicious blood-blasted images help overcome the logical gaps while the amazing performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at that time) and Michael Caine makes every scene special. Let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary, erotic charged odyssey, and you'll enjoy every setting of "Dressed To Kill".
