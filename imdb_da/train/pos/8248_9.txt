When you see the cover of the DVD, you are convinced that this is a class B cheesy cheapie, a movie made for $ 1,000 in your backyard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a smart on it. It is also very touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (it looks good), the actors are known, the direction of the film and sets are great. It is fantastic. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Ann Moss, who plays counter-type, is amazing, like "Helen Robinson", June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Theopolis") is a laugh with neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are excellent, also K'Sun Ray as young "Timmy Robinson," should rather not overlooked. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story, it sounds so stupid that few of you would see it. Just take the word of the people here who liked it and thought it was a very, very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor; a recognition of the absurd.
