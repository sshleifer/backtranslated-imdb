I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was. The performances were extremely good, especially by Rea as the compassionate no-nonsense detective. <br /> <br /> In spite of a low budget, no big FX or flashy camera work, Citizen X somehow manages to surpass most similar big Hollywood movies. Telling. The. History. True stories tend to end with a whim rather than a bang, and this is the case here, but apart from that, this is a highly recommended detective yarn.
