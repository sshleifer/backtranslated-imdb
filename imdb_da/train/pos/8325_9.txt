I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I first saw a trailer to it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the picture of him as the kind, playful, little evil genius was enough to make me see the movie. Matthaus's extra spice like Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure imagination, but a lovely one. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be Einstein's niece. Using four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed begins an attempt to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix and you have fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is packed with great character actors and lovely sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a vicious imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderful endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan play a step above her normal room com level. Stephen Fry is a joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancee; there is a single romantic bone missing in his body. <br /> <br /> The movie fell under most radars, but is a lovely treasure that does not become obsolete with repeated views. It has first-class writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.
