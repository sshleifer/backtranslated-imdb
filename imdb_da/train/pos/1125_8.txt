Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real duds like the sinister Cold War satire The Day the Fish Came Out. However, Iphigenia is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play of Euripides, it is a superior rendition of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance for many years in the US with the courtesy Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale, but is certainly not a "big" movie, emphasizing the simple story: King's agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou) much to the grief of queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both excellent, but it is the amazing Papamoschou that brings the most interesting elements to the screen and blends childhood innocence with the daily realization that she is the peasant of a political game. Highly recommended to fans of international cinema.
