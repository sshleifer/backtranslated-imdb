Blonde and Lace have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more from a movie, you're totally unreasonable. It feels like a late era Carry On, as the series was no longer flaming paths, but was even more fun than not, think behind or england, and you won't be too far away from the mark. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece they make, even though you can give me it over many things I am told to like. The support aids are energetic, although some of them are not very good; I don't see a couple of duff turning into a movie that's already almost forgotten, making a lot of difference, so just smiling. I really think Blonde and Lace are Aces, and I hope you hate me for that.
