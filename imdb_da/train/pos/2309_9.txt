It was life-changing, it was really !!! The man in the moon is a breathtaking experience to see. The action was amazing, the story was amazing, and it was a perfect start to Reese Witherspon's career. I don't see how anyone couldn't love this movie. It's not the best movie ever, even though it was close to it, but it was very fun to watch, and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes and many other little laughs. Of course, there was something that cried your heart for moments as well, but this movie was enlightening and it lit up your day, even if you have to get a little depressed from time to time. I can't believe this movie doesn't win at least a price, nor can I believe it has been seen by such small people on this site. Watch this movie if you don't, because it actually touches.
