Very slick, very Pre-Hays code, and still very sassy. I would highly recommend watching this movie even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck. She is fun, she is sexy, she is hardworking - and loves what she gets! Barbara Stynwyck is great as a doozie of a floozy who rises in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bank building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Plays one of her first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a letdown, but the sets, lines, garments all add to a heck of a movie about to rise vertically in horizontal position.
