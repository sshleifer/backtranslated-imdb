The walk of the rose. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> A blend of old Western and hip hop blended perfectly together. The clothing style, the nature and the plot are all suitable for what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - for five years, the twenty-seven banks robbed and then disappeared without trace. Now, a small western town is besieged, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it is personal. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash) up after five years of riding together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends up rounding up her friends and running on a sway. <br /> <br /> A good, muck around version of Western. (If you've seen bad girls, then it's a little better in the ways of the female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, the plot and the landscape made it to me.
