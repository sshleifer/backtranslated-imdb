I am a member of a canoe club and I can tell you the truth that giving is synonymous with the peace and quiet of the experience. When we put our boats in the water, banjo echoes in the back of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it grows philosophically by the human being in nature and the effect of technology on man's relationship with nature. We see it in the arch fishing. We see it in the homemade tent. There is also the city's contempt and sense of superiority to the rural woodsman "cracker". The fact that the bank from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" is supposed to put him on the same level with the forests that also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the life and death struggle replaces the "civilized people" suppositories of the "law". This canoe trip ends too early for the viewer, but unfortunately not soon enough for the characters.
