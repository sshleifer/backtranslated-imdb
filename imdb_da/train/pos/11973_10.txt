Full House is a wonderful sitcom about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. Then Danny asks her sister-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis, and best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help raise her three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite program ever and I can see it all day long. And something at Full House always makes me laugh, and there are also sad parts. There is never a dull moment in the whole house. The main characters are played by Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Michelle Tanner).
