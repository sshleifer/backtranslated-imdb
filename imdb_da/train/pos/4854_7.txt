Curl up with this on a dark and stormy evening and prepare to be shifted by calm, annoyed and frightened. The creaking old plot of a phantom train, which is said to run through the lonely English landscape by death at night, may be impossible, but it is very fun. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like "THE ACCIDENT" that the locals can remember but will not talk about. But first and foremost, the film is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to highlight his particular brand of vaudeville style humor between the scary bits. Askey's corny humor is not very trendy these days, but if you just let it wash over you, it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's films.
