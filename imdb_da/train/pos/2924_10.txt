Nominal NR (would be rated R for penetrating strong language and raw sexual humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first stand up comedy routine. This came out in 1983. The hill he saw the star in the movie 48 hrs and Trading Places and he was on Saturday Night Live.Eddie made two stand up comedy movies.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the topic to be more humorous .Delirious is also very fun with Eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. Any fan of stand-up comedy movies should watch Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
