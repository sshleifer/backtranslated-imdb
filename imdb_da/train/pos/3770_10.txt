When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and not necessarily to change the world? If you are aware of this, expect to have lots of fun while watching "Bill and Ted's Fake Journey". This is a movie that has lots of fun to see, Keanu and Alex make a great play that represents their characters from "Bill and Ted's great adventure" with even more "style" in their first movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great to laugh, the characters are extremely similar and the story is so radical that you have to laugh. Don't expect "deep and meaningful" just expect pure fun!
