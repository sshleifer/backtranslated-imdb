This story based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ("Usher House House", "Death of Death") is actually pretty scary from the beginning to the end. It looks like some of the old black and white films about people meeting in an old outdated house (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of lifestyle dolls who terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he?) And the residents of the house are exposed to a number of frightening experiences. I will not go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of ancient dark house mysteries. <br /> <br /> See it with lots of popcorn and sodas in a dark room. /> Dan Basinger 8/10
