Weaken peace man? Apparently. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry all hit each other, but Butch stops and wants to know why. That's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, can't they?" He asks Tom who nods his head in agreement. "Mice can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees it is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They go in and Butch prepares a "Peace Treaty" (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the rest, and most of the comic, are the three of them that are extremely cozy to each other. What a refreshing change in pace. I found it fun to watch. I can get a million of these cartoons where everyone beats each other. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew that peace didn't last. A large piece of steak comes from the "Peace Treaty", but on the way it was nice change and still had some of the usual Tom & Jerry smart humor.
