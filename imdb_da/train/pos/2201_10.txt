I just finished watching the first disc in a 4-disc (26 episodes) collection created in connection with UCLA Film & TV Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (except for the first episode), the picture quality is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as when I first saw it (5 years old at the time) and Wally Cox is really endearing in this role. If you're in the mood for quiet comedy that falls on you, unlike hitting you over your head, you'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood. Although some of the gags are a bit corny, most are brilliant and well run ... and even the corny are fun. This is a television series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it.
