If you have had drama in your life, either your own or someone close to you, the pain stages are this woman (but, in my opinion, easy to be a man) goes through is very real. It's a movie about not being able to handle your pain, not knowing what to do to help you get through it. Of course, it is also a film about not knowing how to help someone close to you, to get through their pain. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that can push anyone over the edge ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure I would recommend anyone to watch this movie, especially anyone close, but for me ... it's a movie that puts things in perspective that shows real pain and is therefore very relevant to being alive. It makes you realize that hi, you or the person near you has lived through pain, that hey, all the things you worry about now are of such importance
