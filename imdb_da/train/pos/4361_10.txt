This was probably one of the most well-made films in the 40s - Warner Bros. in the height of their style. Sun Polito photography is undoubtedly his best achievement - beautiful compositions and lighting with delicate shade. Max Steiner contributes with one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classic search engine method. The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this film went on to make "Now Voyager" later this year - a fine movie that won honor and prizes and went down as a historic favorite because it was Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better movie - better done in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A most unusual film that entertains those who take it to what it is, rather than projecting their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection. Each thing must be judged in its own time reference and for what it seeks to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I have read in these reviews are so childish and totally lacking in the point. If you are hungry for a perfectly filet mignon, do not go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff dough. The art of film criticism is really lost in a large segment of the population. Sorry guys - maybe if this movie had a score of Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul-seeking subplots, you would all be pleasantly pleased. I take an old movie without modern intellectual performance one day a week!
