As the title is in English and IMDb lists this show's primary language as English, I will concentrate on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as featured in the Bandai-released DVD set. My actual review for the whole series is under IMDb's entry of Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W (1995). Very little has changed in terms of plot, script and characterization its adaptation to English and it really depends on your taste to choose which language to watch this show in. Purists can stick to Japanese all they want but for one more "realistic" experience, I recommend the English track, since all the characters, except Heero Yuy, are not Japanese (most of them are actually Caucasian with a few non-Japanese Asians.) For one thing, the personality's personality comes across more " direct "than in the Japanese version. The contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-take performances, but a very well-formed group of actors. <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam's pilot Heero Yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. Voted by Mark Hildreth, who is deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad deal" but it matches Heer's personality very well. <br /> <br /> Deathscyt Gundam's Duo Maxwell, who is ever cheerful to death, gets a crash course in appreciating the value of life and friends. He may be the best-traded character throughout the show, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. He may sound a little too old for his age, but Duo's English voice sounds easy from his annoying nasal Japanese. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul who has only the sole purpose so far been combat; Despite his inner desire to make connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to be friends. Kirby Morrow gives a bleak but realistic performance as Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba Winner is spoken by Brad Swaile, who has no trouble spreading the character and shattered his innocence as he experiences horror of war and death first hand. A big plus is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes, he is pronounced by a female actress in the Japanese version), but a bona fide typically 15 year old guy. <br /> <br /> The impulsive but definite Wufei Chang pronounced by Ted Cole may seem a little over-the-top, but it is in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, spoken by Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not fit well with her youthful personification early in the series, but as her character matures later in history, her voice follows suit and ends up fitting well with character development. <br /> <br /> Zech's Merquise would be one of the more drastically altered voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring out different pages for the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect, keeping up with his high-ranking status and charismatic character. His English voice by Brian Drummond is more subdued, silent and "snake-like" that highlights Zech's secretive character with regard to his hidden agendas and faithful beliefs in his ideals. The members of OZ are a mixed bag really. Treize Kushrenada pronounced by David Kaye gets a more realistic and down-to-earth performance over his greater than Japanese style of life. Lady Une, however, does not transfer her split personality as contrasting as in the Japanese version, and Lucrencia Noin sounds just ......... bored most of the time. The gunfire pilots and the military leaders are nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I would have appreciated whether they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. The Maganac Corps votes were generally uninspired, but could have been more interesting if they got Middle Eastern accents. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have solved better with a classic European accent that reflects their nobility. <br /> <br /> In spite of the side-grades, the headbox manages to carry the show, resulting in a total less over-the-top and more realistic rendering of the Gundam Wing's script. Very true to the original Japanese script, as all underlying ideas evoke ideas of politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also preserves the errors in the original Japanese script.
