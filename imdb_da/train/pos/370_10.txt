I've seen this movie at least fifty times, and having seen it last week for the first time, I still have it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but was aroused by Spielberg's expertise and fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for his short but powerful depiction of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience all human emotions while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and became angry. Like most amazing films, it was looked over by the academy with a number of nominations, but no one wins. But this movie is undoubtedly one of the best movies all the time.
