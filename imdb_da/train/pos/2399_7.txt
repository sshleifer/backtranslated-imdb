This was a hit at the South-Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin last year, and has a finely cast piece on the head of the E. R. Gloria Reuben and a natural chew John Glover. Though shot on a small budget in NYC, the movie looks and sounds great and takes us on a backstage swirling through the rehearsal and fitting of what actors call "The Scottish Play" as a reference to the word "Macbeth" intended to bring on the doctor's old curse. The acting company exhibits all the feelings of the play itself, desire, jealousy, rage, suspicion and some fun too. The games begin when a completed actor is replaced (in the main) by a well-known "beautiful face" from the television soap opera to create larger crowds. The green eyes take over, and the drama unfolds nicely. Nice soundtrack and good performances all around. The DVD contains the instructor's comments and some deleted scenes as well.
