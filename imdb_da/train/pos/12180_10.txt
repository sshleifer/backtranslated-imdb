In my opinion, a GUY THING is a fun, witty, sexy, romantic and absolutely beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were dazzling as a confused groom-to-be and his soon to be sexy cousin. If you ask me, they lit up on the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I unpack this, I would like to say that the performance was top class, the direction was flawless, the production design was good, the molding was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You are in too many laughs and tensions, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, save back with a friend and see it.
