The man, if anyone expected a big zombie movie after reading that title, then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed. For myself, I expect a low-budget cheeseball zombie flick - and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be because all the zombies had just turned around, so they are fresh dead zombies. It was clear that they did it because it would have been quite expensive if they had done full-on rotted zombie FX. I understood it all, I have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie. It's called "HIGH OF THE DEATH DEATH" for God's love! Want to see "Redneck Zombies" and any Uwe Boll movie and actually expect it to be amazing? Of course not! So why are there some morons on IMDb whining as school girls about this movie, I never understand. Oh and YES, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst you have ever seen, because you know you're full of it! You ever see "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House Of The Dead" ???? It's some of the worst I've ever seen. If you cannot see that it is only a low-budget zombie film that is of course made of zombie film fans, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Thumbs up from me and I would also like to see a sequel.
