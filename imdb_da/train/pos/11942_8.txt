At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how hard he was while searching for a scoop. Meanwhile, the late Joe describes the identity of the tarot card serial killer in London. He cheats Reaper and looks out for American journalist student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the midst of a magical show by magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells her that the killer is aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) . Sondra pulls Sid into his investigation and searches for evidence that Peter is the killer. But she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen's comedy outside Manhattan, actually again in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply amazing, and I laughed a lot at the fate of his hero in a country where people are driving "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely fun and Woody Allen is in an excellent form as a comedian. But his contemporary mouse Scarlett Johansson, which I am a great fan of, has overpowering and annoying for many moments, and changes including her accent to a histrionic pronunciation. Her character is completely silly and promiscuous, and I was very disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a fun and dignified entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
