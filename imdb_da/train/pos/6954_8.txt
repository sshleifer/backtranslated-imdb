This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen this year, and the laughs of the members support me. Not since my Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), the laughter has been so spontaneous and intense. It is easily intricate as last year's Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in the use of parody (espionage in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). The director's Ivan Reitman balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and just ridiculous is great. The shock and the dramatic seriousness never break the comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy loses its touching emotional elements even though the ending is broadcast in advance. In some ways it is so clear that it is good to see how it plays out. Sometimes, as in real life, sometimes it is so clear that you cannot really see it. Eighty out of ten stars ranking up there with Tootsie (1982). Possibly a nine (depends on how it is displayed by another view).
