I didn't like the Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I didn't look at his other movie. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Side-3 is nicely made. Seems genuine. As Satya from RGV did. <br /> <br /> The mental illness in the so-called high society is the summary of the movie. In the midst of all the illness, it is difficult to lead a normal life, as the main character, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to be seen with children or expecting wives. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities of the rich and elite parties that enjoy much more rubbish than is reported. How this page-3 is also a business opportunity is shown in the movie. Event management firms are paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people celebrated overnight by clicking on photos with celebrities invited to the party. Western culture has penetrated deep into Mumabi's high society. The movie shows it boldly, no team is blocked. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
