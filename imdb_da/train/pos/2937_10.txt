I know it's raw and I know it's not PC at all, but it's so much fun. If you can put it in perspective, it is from the early 80's and it carries all the stereotypes of the time - and the movie makes you increasingly crazy about laughter - than it really is a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject of this movie is exaggerated. If you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half just to get an all-out laugh, please see this. <br /> <br /> P.S. Would someone please put this on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
