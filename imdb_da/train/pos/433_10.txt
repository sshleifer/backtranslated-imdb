This is one of the rare films, it is lovely and compelling, dignified and quirky, a true gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wider experience (yup, find the magic). I especially loved Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but all managers and supporting actors are flawless in this movie. Additional costumes, if you are drawn on fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done. I just wish they would release it on DVD because I have my tape version out! <br /> <br /> Definitely worth your time, just be sure to settle in to see it, without interruption.
