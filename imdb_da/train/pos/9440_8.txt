"Deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films coming out of the wonderful 1970's from which many other movie films came. A group of friends set off on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become the victim of a lot of toothless hillbillies who are almost trying to destroy their lives. It is fantastic. We are treated for anal rape, vicious battles, bow and arrow tricks, shootings, broken bones, etc. Much like 1974's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to say "Deliverance" is credible would be immature. This would never and could never happen even in the dark in 1972. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action. It is one in a large pile of movie utilization that comes from the early 70's and it is (undoubtedly) sitting on top of the pile of amazing plays, amazing movies and excellent writing. 8 out of 10 children.
