Simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are at Hulu. I challenge anyone to see the first three episodes in season 1 and not like it. I guarantee you will finish watching the season. So I guarantee you will see season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to see it: 1. Anderson Cooper is fun 2. The location in Europe is fantastic 3. The games are mentally challenging 4. It's a lot interactive 5. In an episode, a player reacts to another player desperately: "I'm trying as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate, "not necessarily." <br /> <br /> Can you figure out ... Who is the pier?
