As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a productive guy. Hes made hundreds of hundreds of movies, many of which are crap. However, he managed to sneak into an occasional quality work among all the assembly line utilization. "Succubus" is not his best job (it is either "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his store catalog. He combines the erotic (switching between showing full frontal nudity and leaving something back to the imagination) and the surreal seamless. This is a very dreamy movie, full of good mood. I especially liked the constant naming. Despite being incredibly pretentious, it is fun to hear all of Franco's influences. <br /> <br /> There are still many users who don't like "Succubus" and I can see where they come from. It's relaxed, but I can handle it. More problematic is the incoherence. Of course, the scripture here was hasty, and within five minutes of the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and it never really came together from that time). Those who want some fabric with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it will never be really scary or even exciting. Still, I was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that I didn't really mind these big mistakes. (7/10)
