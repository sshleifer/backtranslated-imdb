I reviewed some old VHS tapes I have and came across the TV show John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. It made me go to my computer and look it up to see if I could find a DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed that I couldn't find it yet on DVD. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a lovely show. I have the disc and the CD, but I want to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the picture quality is pretty good, but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also a few other songs that are not added to the CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you don't have the CD, it's a wonderful Chritma's collection of songs taken from that show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on.
