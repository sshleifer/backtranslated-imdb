Henri Verneuil's films may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of Condor or JFK, but certainly not worse and sometimes even better than those classic genre representatives. The action takes place in a fictitious Western state where the fictional president has been killed. After several years of investigation, special government commissions decide that the president was killed by a lonely gunman. But a man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there's something more to investigate and then the movie starts. This film does not address exact theories, but it embraces the entire structure of government-community relations in today's world. Such a movie could only be made in the 1970s, but it will never lose its reality. In addition, it is even a little scary how precise it is oracles. 10 out of 10
