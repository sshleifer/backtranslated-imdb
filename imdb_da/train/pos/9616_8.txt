Worth seeing twice because of the rapid causal shifts among several compelling stories, "Bug" appears as a fully satisfying work of art that plays outstanding optimistic love against countless examples of frustrating reality. My favorite character is Wallace (John Carroll Lynch) whose overall concern for life - from a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible - hits the movie; Olive (Christina Kirk) who spends a lot of time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable TV technician with unlimited trust in fortune cookie messages: "You will meet the dream girl." <br /> <br /> Against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality, all generated by acts of character: parking tickets, a clogged drain in a Chinese food / donut shop, TV interruption, a broken auto fender, an obliterated dinner reservation which ultimately results in the cancellation of a Hawaiian holiday. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun: The olives get drunk in a Chippendale show, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative trying to handle an irat customer, the Kim obsessive Cyr (Brian Cox) faces a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) responds to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile Chinese cookie fortunes: "Your boyfriend is lying to you" and the guy who falls asleep while painting a jackhammer because he spent night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat. <br /> <br /> A minor story with public cabl e access host (Darryl Theirse) and a local actor teacher from "The Boy in the Bubble" express the main theme: Love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" maintains at the very same level as "trains, planes and cars" but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye.
