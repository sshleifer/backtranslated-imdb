I watched this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they showed this movie as a dual feature with Tom Jones (1963). I haven't seen this movie on the TV side. I was interested in watching this movie because one of the stars is the very fun and talented Jim Dale, who Lusty sails. I think Dale is now telling the Harry Potter books about Casette, yet he's quite funny. This is a quick comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their movie collection and consider restoring and releasing this movie to DVD. Christopher Plummer is fun as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as Ramble the sailor. This is a bawdy comedy, the kind of movie you no longer see, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars out of ****
