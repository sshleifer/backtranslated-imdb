I really like what I've seen in this cartoon so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but honestly, I'd rather see this type of more cartoon-like style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply (which began to happen more and more often - it's just a style that looks good when much time and effort is put into it). There is nothing wrong with the angled lines and the small black dots eyes - I actually think it's really cute. As a child I never thought that Scooby-Doo's design was particularly sweet, but I think I might like it better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character and believes it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for a depth. Sure, the show is not centered on the original "Mystery-solving" theme, but it was just a tired old formula anyway. Don't make me wrong - I'm sure there are writers out there who might be much more interested in Mystery Inc.'s traditional pursuits (which are so late late), but meanwhile this show is a fun departure from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still fun, but not just comic relief. They are still sweeping, but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old overwhelming slackers as ever, but now they actually seem to get on with their lives using Uncle Albert's legacy. <br /> <br /> I used to find the most original Scooby-Doo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentional fun at best, but this show actually carries a real sense of humor. Also, I really never like Casey Kasem as Shaggy anyway, so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does other people. (I still think Billy West was the best, though) <br /> <br /> All in all, while it's not a big comic book within the framework of all cartoon stories, still a performance among other Scooby incarnations.
