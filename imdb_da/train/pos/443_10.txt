I first saw this movie back in the early 90s when it was first released. Room with a view was also recent. Enchanted April had so much more to offer! I found it much more real and earthly, the signs more believable to be 'normal'. At the end of the movie, I felt the same as I did when I first saw BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I longed for the characters to find what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You get a feeling throughout that Italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent to take a risk and leave everything that is humdrum and constricting. But in the spring of April, everyone's life loosens and resolves (in line with the Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilds to everyone's satisfaction. What a little gem of a movie! How is it no longer known?
