The movie I thought was excellent, it was enough to be about romance with little excitement in between. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I don't know why people still give him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris, she's a great actress, and for those who think she's too old for Rob, it's only five years. <br /> <br /> Rob played a leading role in his own TV series and one on Scifi channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also played a number of television films and is now making a TV mini series. <br /> <br /> They need to give him more leading roles, that's what he likes best.
