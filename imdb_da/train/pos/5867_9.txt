Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80s. It is a movie that breathes through fantastic plays and a very interesting direct touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema can find things to relate to. The play is very convincing and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris provides one of the greatest performances updated. He portrays his alcoholic perfectly and makes us feel his broken heart in every line, every move. Robert De Niro once again makes us aware of him as one of the greatest players of all time in one of the simplest, but also most realistic, ideas in his career. Jacknife is never boring as it shows its heroes free of any typical Hollywood's typical character elements. After the war, no one is a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this film is about the simple truth. No one can repair his pieces after a war, like the gentlemen in this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that the war creates. Simply magnificent movie.
