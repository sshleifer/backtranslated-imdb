While Urban Cowboy does not ooze the same testosterone you might find on a rodeo, it gave an accurate glimpse of the day and age of Texas City. I also think that in order to really criticize this movie, one would have to have lived in time and in the relative place it was created. There was good music, fun times and yes, a few "hard and tumbler" on the hip tonk roadhouses. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, as "two ships passing by at night", was well thought out. When Pam revoked the note that Sissy had written to Bud, it echoed the tragedy of many true life novels. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the play was well-written and corrected. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best support actor.
