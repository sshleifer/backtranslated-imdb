If I didn't know anything better, it almost seemed like it was staged, but it wasn't. It was created perfectly and how they got all that picture is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well-documented in this documentary, and the classic footage they got made this an unfortunate classic. Only the story in the footage alone should make it a MUST watch for any American or person affected by the September 11 tragedy.
