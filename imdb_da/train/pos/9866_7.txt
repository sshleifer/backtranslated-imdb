Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and very nice movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are lovable and tidy, but it really shines is the digital set design. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than reality, the designers give you a really great look at the world in an amazing use of color. Sometimes reality shines through (especially the water was impressive), but it is still a fantasy world based on reality. Including lots of large landscapes, especially helps minimize the cost of reproduction. Pixar film shines with technical shine, this shining with the effective use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Enough technical babble, the movie's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just fun fun.
