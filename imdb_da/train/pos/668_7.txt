I just watched "The Last Wave" in my school's art library. It's exciting, like all of Peter Weir's stuff, but it's not always as attentive as I would have liked. I was fascinated by the ideas thrown at me (because they are handled very well by the film director Weir), but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA, I was a little sad about places. <br /> <br /> The reason surrounds an Australian lawyer who is obsessed with certain dreams he has that connects him to an aborigine group he defends. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather sequence and has some very amazing mood effects throughout (especially the bizarre, "bending" sound design) and strong direction; but it did not tell me as Weir's later film does. Maybe I just have to see it again myself. <br /> <br /> Good movie about obsession and mystery. Because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the aborigines gives some very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God blesses Peter Weir. For him alone, this movie is worth seeing ... very organic director. As an Aussie answer, Malick! I would give it a 7 because it has got enough good ideas to overcome its dull moments.
