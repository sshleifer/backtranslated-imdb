A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the Slovenian late summer province. In the beginning you see a person in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth, and when the same young man in his black pants leaves the house with two suitcases, you see that the trouser part is missing on a prey (apparently his father has died). In the train he meets a young lady, and almost without words, but many small gestures, begins a wonderful love story. It's somehow surreal, very poetic, and a little bizarre movie, with many weird characters and strange events. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
