The only show I've seen since 90210! Why did they interrupt it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you were part of it all! The least they have to do is release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked out similar shows, but nothing has come close. The cast had incredible chemistry and I was very much looking forward to every episode of great anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling that show. If anyone has information on where to get a DVD from the North Shore, please send some lines here. Thanks! Aloha!
