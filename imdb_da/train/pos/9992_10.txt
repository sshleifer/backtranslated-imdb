... this is a classic with so many good dialogues and scenes no one should miss. Nice story, fun wealth situations, Mel Brooks is not a bad management, maybe not perfect, but he's fun; D Do not pay attention to the assessment, it is BS. See it, then see something as the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I don't think we can be friends XD At this point, I recommend the fourth season for "Curb Your Enthusiasm" for every Brooks fan;) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms! I need to make 10 lines here to write a comment? I don't want to write a book here: P
