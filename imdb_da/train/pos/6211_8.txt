The fleet was released in 1936 in the middle of depression, as people had a hard time worldwide finding jobs or even finding food to put on the table. In Europe, Hitler joined other nationalist / socialist whack jobs. In the United States, seed of the cartel, which was sown with the Federal Reserve Act and the amendment on income tax (16), began to bear fruit for associated finance capitalists and their dominant secret societies. <br /> <br /> For the average guy and girl the times were tough. Enter Hollywood with at least some hopeful pictures? I don't think we can properly call them propaganda at this time, even though this film is about war preparatory navel exercises. The real problem for boys and girls was, as now how to connect with the right one, leading a decent life, having wonderful children with a modicum of grace and elegance. <br /> <br /> The odds were long. <br /> <br /> For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com. <br /> <br /> Brian Wright Copyright 2007
