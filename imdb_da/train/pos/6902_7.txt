This is a modest, character-driven comedy recorded in Brazil on a low budget. The prerequisite is known, the same as in the 1950s Danny Kaye film ** On Double **: A person who, as a joke, gives the impression of a famous person becomes so dragooned to unfold the person into reality. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two conductors is very effective. Raul Julia as the German-Paradorian secret policeman is tall, cool, threatening and Latin. He has a deliberately blurred blonde dye. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York Jewish, is fun and sympathetic. There are many references and interior jokes about show business. <br /> <br /> The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay. Paraguay was actually ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by Secretary General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. But author / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with huge differences in wealth and an active guerrilla crisis. Further in this spirit, Mazursky casts cartoon Jonathan Winters as an American pensioner, who is truly C.I.A. station manager in the Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the country's president a mocking lace. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has less influence in Paraguay, virtually without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is because the country has fought long and expensive wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost annihilated both times, but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level there is a bow to feminism in the form of the Madonna character. Madonna is played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, a former nightclub dancer who is the body-flow presidential joy girl at the start of the movie but is seen on television as president even at the end - now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, the hair blurred back, swept to office with a velvet revolution. <br /> <br /> When such an event actually took place in Latin America, the administration of Argentina's Isabel Peron (not the beloved Evita, who never had office) two years after his husband's death, was legendary ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
