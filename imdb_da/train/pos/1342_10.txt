An enchanting, wonderful look at the films that inspired the outstanding Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he is talking about are easy to relate to his works, especially the earlier, the silent era. Very fun, even though I was a little long, I found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet. Necessary view if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
