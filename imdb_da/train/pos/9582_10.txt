Having grown up in Detroit's giant streets, MI, and having friends who traveled to New York balls, I fell into the lifestyle of being a member of this House. I came to Theieves House. We customized the same rules as most houses, but we were professional villains who wanted to increase and commit credit card fraud to get the amazing jewels and clothes we wanted. I even learned to fight the control and driving license and deposit them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and I went to federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this movie, and I strongly recommend that you see it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in homes in Detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in. My book, Identity Schemes is available on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, it's much better than Paris burns because it's a 2005 brand.
