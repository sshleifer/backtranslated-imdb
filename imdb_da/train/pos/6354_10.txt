Jim Carrey can do everything. I thought this was going to be a stupid childish movie and it was not. It was so incredibly fun for ALL, adults and kids. I saw it once because it was almost out of theaters, and now it's finally on DVD on Tuesday, and I'm very happy to see you. You should definitely see it if you don't already have it, it was so good! <br /> <br /> Liz
