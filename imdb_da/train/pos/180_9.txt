When Gundam0079 became the film trilogy, most of us are familiar with, much of it was pure action and less of everything else. This OVA is quite the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not filled with action, but emotional things. The two main action sequences in this, I think, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many gundam series, movies and OVAs, I was quite ready for a civil-esquire movie. This movie did a great job. What makes this movie stand out is that it shows that both sides of the war have good and bad people. This made the Zeons appear more human than the original films depicted as the second rise of evil Nazis. Most people who don't like anime that I have to watch this movie (lol) liked it. So I would recommend it to many people just for the anti-war story. If you are a Gundam fan and have not seen this, do not read this; You should already see it right now.
