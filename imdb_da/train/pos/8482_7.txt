This is an extremely colossal vulgar, stupid all-star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that Warner Bros could afford. ... and, like most other rarely seen films actually made in the late 20s, put an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuinely roaring anti-theft enemy and youthful singing and dancing. SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic. Vaudeville trades after soliloquy after taped dance after acrobat after comedian after fandan after ukulele lunacy after Rin Tin Tin, who introduces 'an oriental number' ... (!) ... and on and off lumbering, grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality Vitaphon sound. It's been too long, but among them delirious delights is the amazing "Singin in the Bathtub" number created on a scale, of which the QE2 architects would be proud ... Beatrice Lillie lounges by a grand piano with some fun boys who are funny transforms a witty diny, Nick Lucas, and the infinite grand finale in two-color color ... all set for the song LADY LUCK. . So striking is the carbon line and jumping teens to keep us capable of almost kicking themselves in their own faces with joy and effort. Row of rows of "Doll" characters jump past and some even come from the floor. I do not ask you, there are even girls attached to the crystal crowns, mummified with shiny gauze and combed with pearls that cannot move (in days I imagine during production), while this cats jaw of toy-box athleticism smokes and spasms below the ukulelle orchestra. Of course, I loved it and had to see this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks at the end to just scare and scare them separately and roll around in the living room in screaming joy at each and every exclamation of their scary reactions. And you must too ... and rejoice that there was an era when this was created just to entertain and excitement. It's all so demented.
