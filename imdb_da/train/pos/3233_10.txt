This is a top Finnish movie this year, although Tango Kabaree comes close. For a few years, director Lampela made another fine little movie called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman) .Joki is really true to life's beautiful movie of a Saturday afternoon in a small village / town. The actors may not be as beautiful or beautiful, but they act beautifully. I certainly hope that many of them will receive the JUSSI statue (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this movie could also make it abroad.
