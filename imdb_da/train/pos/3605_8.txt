girlfight uses a familiar formula as someone pointed out, but I've seen lots of movies that don't do well or it's not so credible. I think it's finally easier for a woman to empathize and that way feels more affected by the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is encouraging both mentally and physically, even though your life and environment were completely different and I think the viewer can still get a lot to see this. Although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, it was the movie that gave me the sparkle. So the plot is known / common. actors are good. But the thoughts that it can spark are what makes it above average in my opinion. It made a big impression on me, and I know I'm not the only one.
