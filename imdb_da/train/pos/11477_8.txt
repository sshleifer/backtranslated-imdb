In my honest opinion, everyone should watch this movie at least once. It really put things in perspective when I saw it. Although it was fictitious, this film is about something that could happen to your children. It shows how easily two children can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to kill innocent students. This movie would not have worked in any other format. They completely ejected the handheld camera. It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to watch the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fictional version of our dreams come true. We're going to see the baby behind the monster. The only bad thing about this movie is that it didn't do well on the market and few people even know it existed. If it would have had a single example of a single blockbuster movie, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I think this is the best movie adaptation of a school recording of the few who have really tried it. The recording takes only about ten minutes of the one-and-a-half movie because it focuses primarily on Cal and Andre and what they did until then. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, hire it and see it. I guarantee that when it is finished, you will be speechless.
