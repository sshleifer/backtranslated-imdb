In fact, I never bought satanic and stuff in the metal, but this movie kind of played on that idea. Though it is certainly not a movie that takes seriously or judges really high, it serves the purpose of entertaining while it is playing. The story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream about it, and the band starts to go on a killed spree from beyond the grave. So yes, a little "nightmare on Elm Street" plot goes on here. Granted Freddy has never melted a girl in a car before. There was another movie with a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played out when it had a band that at all took over a city of children and made them crazy. This one simply has one fan of the band whose purpose is to help the killer with the spirit first and then try to stop him. Nothing to be cruel in it, as I can't remember all that many gory kill. Frankly, the scene I remember most is the girls' scene that carries the headphones and then becomes crumbled by some kind of creativity incarnation of the band. Nothing good, but a good time filler.
