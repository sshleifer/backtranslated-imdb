This movie should be my favorite all the time. It shouldn't have a plot because its decision makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to think it was a real snus movie. This was an exercise in visual effects, and is not cut away when the action happens like any other movie does. Movies these days are now about sound effects, which makes it possible to make images using computers, because it is easier to handle CGI blood. There are still film producers who still can't make false blood look like the right thing. There is no rape scene because it was not supposed to make the movie. Have you seen the hills have eyes 2? The rapeseed scene was fun instead of shocking. Although I am sure, there are some GONZO porn movies makers who have tried to marry pornography with horror. But since they probably suck at making movies, they would probably not be able to pull it out. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene, because the actresses are actually pornstars, and they show everything even though the film generally sucks. It's too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his Hostel movie series much better, but he also tame it for an R-rating ... or at least I hope his movie is sucked on because of these limitations. <br /> <br /> See traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you don't want any frills real footage (accident and crime scenes / footage). Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this movie can still stand against most crap made these days, says a lot about this movie. It would be like someone says 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.
