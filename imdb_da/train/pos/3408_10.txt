I give this movie an A + to the clean camp of it! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in her book about her: "If you see the Garden of Allah in high camp, it can be very fun." And where! I happily laughed at the overwhelmed score and the amazing, ridiculous, fantastic melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who have read the accounts of Boyer's toupee (it continued to break into the heat) will sneak every time it looks. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines - instead, they look dreamy in the distance, probably so their faces can be photographed at best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you are In the main role of a turkey, it may also look good!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in her book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and make him design some of the most divine dresses, like chiffon beige dress & cape. I totally agree with the other reviewers rave about Technicolor. It's really hard to believe the movie was made in 1936 - the color is great. <br /> In short, if you see the Garden of Allah with a lukewarm attitude and embrace its misery, you can't help but enjoy it.
