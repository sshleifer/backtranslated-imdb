In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a young television to die, both of which played the same kind of parts they do in California. I have no doubt what led to their casting in this big screen movie. <br /> <br /> California finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend, art photographer Michelle Forbes in a rocky relationship of sorts because of Duchovy's obsession with writing a book and getting into the minds and series of serial killers. In fact, he has got a most unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go across the country and visit sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are flat bread. Fate intervenes in more ways than financially with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a couple of strange southern types who agree to split the gas cost on this cross-country journey. It turns out that Pitt himself is a serial killer and he decides to make a small study himself that goes into the minds of someone who is fascinated by amorality. California is not the type of movie I normally use to go by, but in reality, Brad Pitts acting and charisma make it very much. Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from liberation. But better than he is, Juliette Lewis is again playing these low self-esteem types that she seems to be doing well. See her scene with Forbes as she does her hair, and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis dialogue and Forbes responses should appear in acting classes around the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their slasher flicks, they are no better than California.
