What an amazing movie if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth wears the film on his shoulders, and although there is nothing but him, I still liked it. The music of A.Rehman takes time to grow on you, but after hearing it a couple of times, you really start to like it.
