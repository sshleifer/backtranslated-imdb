I first saw this movie on television some years ago and honestly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most scary crooks anyone can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the ugly good hero. I've never been much of an Eddie Murphy fan, but find his annoying portrayal here a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through The Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is utilizing a hackneyed phrase but the only valid, glowing beauty. Some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the stupid battle scenes and the climatic confrontation. Throughout, Murphy is the modern man suddenly fallen into an oriental myth, an anesthetized and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his Oriental fantasy romp. Like that movie, we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however, briefly enhance the quality of Derek himself. Since 1955, Hong has defined the finest actor, the "classic act" in his profession. "The Golden Child" is stupid; it's not perfect; But it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and entertaining fantasy worth seeing. After four years I have seen "The Golden Child" again; I enjoyed it even more! It is really fun.
