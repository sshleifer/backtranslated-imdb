After reading the other weak reviews and comments I felt I had to come to the bat for this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg's movies tend to have a little to do with each other and expect that one is like one of his likes you are probably outside the brand. <br /> <br /> What this movie is is a thought-provoking and immaculate look at religious beliefs. The only other movie that it - with regard to its religious message - should be Tolkins' The Rapture. I'm surprised someone could say that the story is muddled or supernatural. It's a simple movie about Catholic faith, miracles, and redemption - though you'd never guess it to the end. It is also the only movie I can think of whose resolution is literally in a saying. As a (fortunately) fallen Catholic himself, I know what the film is about, and I find some kind of love in its ultimate innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based, then it just goes over your head. <br /> <br /> As a movie - unlike a story "Full Sky" is not groundbreaking. While 'The Rapture' is heavy with figurative meaning and cinematic images, "Cold Heaven" downplays its own film properties. There are no striking images, no edgy effects, no attempt to customize the content to the form. It is job-creating shooting, but subdued. Nor does it have dialogue or action to put it in a class of high drama. It's a simple story that just unfolds. It may seem strange; but at the end the mystery is revealed. It looks ambiguous; but with a single line, the ambiguity disappears in a puff of Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this regard, "Cold Heaven" has exactly the same kind of thing that drives a movie like "The Sting," or "The Sixth Sense" or "Final Descent" or Polanski's "A Clean Formality" . All these are movies with a trick up on the sleeves. They may frustrate you along the way, but they have a point - an obvious one - but it's fun at least in part to have been taken. <br /> <br /> Still, though it looks like a little more than a shaggy dog ​​story with a punch line, it is worth looking at how it manages and misdirects you. Try it - especially if you are or have ever been a Catholic.
