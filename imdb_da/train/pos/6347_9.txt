How The Grinch Chair Christmas Immediately Stole My Heart And Became My Favorite Movie Almost From My Very First View. Now, eight views later, it still has the same influence on me as it did the first time I saw it. Printer Writers Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman of Who Took Roger Rabbit Fame does a great job of customizing The Grinch's story to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to life, and Jim Carry's typically energetic performance like The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some critics of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of original history. Having read the original story, I have to say that I do not agree. The film makes the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. In fact, the impact of the story reinforces by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They probably wouldn't spoil the movie for you ... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who want to know something about a story Until you have seen it, skip the next two sections.) <br /> <br /> I think almost everyone can relate to The Grinch's horrible school experiences. I think we all at one time or another were the unpopular in school that was always chosen. I know I was ... and so I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Who is naive idealism and believes that no one can be all evil, the heart was tearing. When everyone else had turned his back on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that might have made the movie a little better would have been to further tone down adult humor and content. It was already pretty well maintained, but some of this adult humor (as when The Grinch hit his nose first in Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit into a story like this. <br /> <br /> This is great in its way of being a Christmas classic, taking a richly earned place with the book and the Chuck Jones comic book as a must-see for every Christmas season.
