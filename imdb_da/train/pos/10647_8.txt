I can't understand what fans of the genre did not like this movie. It was really great fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until it came to video which I felt was another reason I wouldn't enjoy the movie. I believe in special effects films should be seen on the big screen, but again it was not the case. For me, the film asks for the comparison with two films released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror movie all the time. The mummy made gobs of money and it was purely drunk. People liked it for its special effects. Movies like Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy, the mummy was a B-ticket to Haunting's E-ticket.
