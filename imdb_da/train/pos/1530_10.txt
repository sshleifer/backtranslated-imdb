Old People Show ???? I am 15 and have watched the show since I was 12, re-encoding it on my Sky + box every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they hadn't canceled it, they didn't even get a good farewell. But what an adventure, all these episodes, I think I've seen all of them, and not one comes to mind that I didn't like and enjoy. It's a shame that the BBC still switches between Murder and Murder She Wrote diagnoses - never seen it and does not intend to. Anyways, his characters in Diagnoses Murder are so profound, and chemistry between the actors is amazing. It was really a sad day when they canceled this show ........
