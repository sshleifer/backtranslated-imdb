Having seen "whipped" on a distributor's screening on AFM the second night, I must say I was thoroughly impressed. The audience laughed all the way through. Unfortunately, all areas were already sold, so I didn't have the opportunity to buy the movie, but I really think it will be a big hit both within and over the sea. I agree with the comment that "whipped" should not be placed as a male "Sex and the City", mainly because unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire of dating that never takes itself too serious. "Whipped" pokes fun on conditions in a way that most sex comedies would not dry. Also the movie I screened at AFM had more of a plot and story than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" combined. The "whip" was never slowed down for a blow and provided the audience with non-stop comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were all rock-solid, making the movie more impressive only in terms of budget.
