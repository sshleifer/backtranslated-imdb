The second of the Why We Fight Series concentrates on Hitler's grab of Sudanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of Neville Chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly termed as propaganda in its time, this series over time has become an informative documentary as well as most of the "Allied bias" that turns out to be historical fact. Fuhrer stands up on his own petard with alley statements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east. The Czechs and Austrians chapters quickly, but the Poles set a heroic battle against overwhelming odds. <br /> <br /> The difference between Hitler's military power and Chamberlain waving in the Munich Treaty as a white flag declaring "Peace of our time" to today, has lasting propaganda properties. Here, in its original context, it resonates even stronger as the darkness of world war sets in on Europe, leaving the American seer with two possibilities, freedom or slavery. In 1943 there was no evasion of this simple truth, and the Nazi strike makes its point effective.
