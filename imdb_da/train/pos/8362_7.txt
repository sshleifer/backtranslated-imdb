Updated version of a story that had been transformed into the film in 1938 England (Frog's return) on the police's follow-up of a master criminal known as the frog due to the frog as the ascent (undulating eyes, etc.) He carries. <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace films from the 1960s is a solid little entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or did this influence) restart of Dr Mabuse films, Miss seems to be more of a super villain than a master thief. Although it's not the best of the Wallace movies, it's worth a look. It would make an interesting double feature with the excellent previous movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
