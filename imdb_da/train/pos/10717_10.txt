Excellent show. Instead of seeing the same old sitcom type showing where it's the same old thing, just different "stars", this refreshing show gave an incredibly entertaining display of office situations. We have been away from watching TV for 2 years and after returning, of all the shows available, we look forward to seeing this show at W. Shame on Global to unplug this one. I thought this would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things FEW Canadian SHOWS does. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show, and I think it was stupid of Global to go away. I suppose they will stick out with the typical insane shows from the states instead of pulling behind a Canadian show that had many promises. Don't make me wrong, I enjoy many shows on TV, but come people, let's keep the variety. This unique show gave a very comical picture of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters that you don't look at any sitcoms today or earlier. Too bad that global had to say no to this one, foolish mistake.
