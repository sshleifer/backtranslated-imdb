This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very beautiful. Soha reminds you so much about her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In a way, you are left unhappy, but if you really think about it, you realize that the only sensible ending was the end shown in the movie. Otherwise, it would have been gross injustice for all. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not appear and she ends up being helped by the witness. Slowly slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is not clear whether she has similar feelings for him or her. Watch the movie for complete details. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Abhay. I'm looking forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is beautiful but didn't speak much in the movie. Her eyes made her innocence most of the speakers.
