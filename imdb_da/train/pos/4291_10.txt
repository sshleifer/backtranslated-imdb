From the leading actor's opening pictures, we get an early picture of how many people live, run by the women in them and the humor that comes through everything that goes on in the daily 'normal' life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, the leader discovers how many European men feel they are in full control of their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work. The use of facial image throughout the movie is amazing, and his clever positioning of the family member (mother) is spot on. <br /> <br /> While there are more than enough laughs in the movie, it is still dealing with single parenting / adoption and the strength of the family in the community. Really rewarding to see and again one that only the French nail is able to do. <br /> <br /> So far one of the best 50 or so movies I've seen this year and worth having a five start rating. I am looking forward to adding this to the DVD collection when it is released and recommend it for all ages.
