It's a bit wild, but I taped from TCM both, this German version of MGM's "Anna Christie" and the English ... but I had to see it first, "because I had heard that many thought it was better than the English version. <br /> <br /> Without seeing the other one, I can't compare them, yet this is an excellent early talkie with Garbo right from the heart. face shines all the time, especially when cameraman William Daniels gets the beautiful close-ups of her. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere in the film seems different to the ordinary MGM stuff made on that era much like French or German expressionist films from the thirties and it was ruled by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who had directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss". <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and provides an absolutelly credible performance as Anna's boyfriend, the hard-boiled hard sailor, there is only one child in the man Hans Junkermann also gives a very good performance, as Anna's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel also as a kindhearted, old cheap floozie. In all a real experience, because it is the only movie where you can listen that Garbo speaks on a foreign language ... 'cos all the other movies she did in either Sweden or Germany were in the quiet time. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
