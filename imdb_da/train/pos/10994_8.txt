This is my first comment! This is a great movie! I saw it all successfully one night on television. For the first 5 minutes, I thought it was a B-movie, but afterwards I understood what a fantastic product it was. <br /> <br /> I suggested some friends to watch the movie just to tell me it was a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial reviews. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a genius product! The well-known director has done an excellent job here and it's a shame to tell him he was out of the game all the time.
