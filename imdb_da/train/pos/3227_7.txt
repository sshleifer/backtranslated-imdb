Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action-thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Soldier plays on a garbage truck that soldier plays as a cross between Rambo and Shane, where Russell hardly speaks as title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for death. The supportive cast of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprising hirsute Michael Chiklis, are capable. They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell and the rest of it running for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he has ever given. With almost no words to say, he conveys emotions, feelings and meaning with appearance and gaze. It's almost a mime performance. When the action sequences come into gear, he kicks ass - and does it in a strong, silent, material-actually way. There are errors. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a good impression of Frank Burns from M * A * S * H ​​as a commander, and Gary Busey shower a gut (and almost busts his belt) as Todd's mentor. This is an undervalued and excellent sci-fi flick and is recommended for anyone who wants another visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples wrote both screenshots.
