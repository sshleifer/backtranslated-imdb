Everything I remember about it was excellent ... great cast with Sam Waterston & George Innes (before becoming known to the American public) .... excellent scripts that only English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type mysteries, but with a Jules Verne twist. A kind of MacGyver would have had it in England 80 years earlier ... right at the beginning of the scientific / technological revolution of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver only sucked 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a much degraded band.
