I saw this when my wife called to inquire from the other room about my choice of fare. My comment? "I see my life!" Although it is younger, but only with 5 years or more, than "Rocket Boys", I remember the absolute rush that Sputnick was met by our training administrators and how the whole of the Science Fair case took off and took me and others in in the competitive whirlwind. My own tornado landed me in my own state's science fair in physics by '62, although our group was less successful in getting support from eg. Firefighters, we approached for guidance and advice until after a tragic event, our city went far to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lake shore. <br /> <br /> This movie brought it all back to me, and I bet it brought it all back to a bunch of us "UberNerds" of the late 50s and early 60s. <br /> <br /> We are in a similar science brain drain now and really need this movie as a country. See it!
