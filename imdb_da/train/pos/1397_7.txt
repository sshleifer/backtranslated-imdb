"Shore Leave" is mostly an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode. I simply think this is not the best representation of what the show should offer fans. It's easy entertaining, nothing more. However, I am pleased to see that a TV show of this type probably made sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew some time, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some actions and tense moments, but most of the story is played by laughs. Good, but unacceptable.
