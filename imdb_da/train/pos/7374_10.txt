For his first debut, this film has some easier and chilling moments. In the best horror movie mode, your stomach tightens every moment during this movie. The end is fantastic. The actors of Blaire Witch have, of course, seen this movie it ends was not an end, but a beginning of the end. An amazing movie and just a piece of Japan's big, scary factor, is a perfect score that makes you think and scare off your mind.
