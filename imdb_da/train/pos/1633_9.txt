I LOVED this flick when it came out in the 80s and still does! I still quote classic lines like "say it again" and "you said you would tear my balls away from the gentleman". Ron Leibman was warm and very fun! Although it was underrated and disowned by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a desert island! I just want someone to release the DVD because my VHS tape is worn out! If you like cheesed out comedy, this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It's military humor at it's best and worse! Rent it if you can't own it!
