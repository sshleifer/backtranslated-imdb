I found this movie to be the usual French flap in America's face. The camera too often focuses on obese people, on sloppy homes and on sticky lands. While the narrative seems to sympathize with and admire the small town people introduced to the viewer, the cinematography utilizes them and demons them. There were undoubtedly thin people that could be seen in Glencoe and neat, organized homes, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will travel to France to reveal the worst elements of the US public. I can assure you as a frequent visitor to France that everything is not good there. Foreign immigrants are not easily equated, creating serious social inequalities. But the Americans are not eager to mask the French for their prejudices against their own compatriots and their envy towards the United States, so we will probably not see movies on the subject.
