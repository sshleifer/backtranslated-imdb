A ghost piece that the discerning horror movie fan will come upon with gratitude. Keep your Freddy's and Jason's - this movie is in the same company as "The Haunting" (the original). Lyrical and truthful, it stays with you long at night, like the terrible CBS Radio Mystery Theater shows. A smart rental.
