As I said at the top, four stars are just not enough. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. For those people who do not really like it or understand it, you must not have a real understanding of art or you may have a short attention. <br /> <br /> Although I haven't seen all his movies yet, I have to say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It's pretty sad to see the movies as big as "The Color Purple" do not follow too often, because I think we all desperately need premium movie entertainment in those tough times. <br /> Films like this are more than just movies; they are works of art that must be appreciated more. The idea of ​​being nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best picture of the year) and not getting a trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can sometimes be. Spielberg was not even nominated for best director! It should have swept Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The movie clearly shows how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only movies were still so good ....
