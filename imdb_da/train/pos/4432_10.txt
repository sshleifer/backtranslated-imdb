I am happy to admit that I am a sucker for a beautiful movie, and enough inventive camera moves and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a rather long film. Not even Gojoe's length, even though it had some of the most remarkable filmography I've seen since the Korean MUSA period. The Gojoe, however, gives far more than just beautiful pictures (like MUSA ... does not do what constitutes a contrast) - it's second-largest strength that is great-acting and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit that I'm totally unsure of what the idea was that it was trying to do at last, but it certainly creates some thoughts along the way. Vague but absolute thoughts: P <br /> A department where the movie could have been better is the action. There is a huge amount of blood gloves in the movie, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and often obscure by objects in the foreground. It creates some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more real movements, something to make it more credible that the bad guys could just wade through the entire army and put waste to everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie is still one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've seen for some time. Recommended!
