I'm not quite sure whether the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, I'm not even sure if this can be used. For the past few years, cinemas have been filled with comedy films that are far too stupid to make us laugh. Therefore, I considered the films that do not meet these requirements as "serious comedies". <br /> <br /> Is this 40-year-old virgin fit into this guild? It's finally up to you, but in my opinion it's a very funny movie. You will laugh a lot, plus it gives a social comment through some really good characters and situations. I am beautiful that there is more than a 40 year old virgin out there and even the people who do not exactly fit this specification can feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men. The story, as the title says, is about Andy, a shy, quiet guy, who gathers action figures, monitors survivors with his octogenic neighbors, and whose favorite band is Asia. Kal is Andy's employee at SmartTech. He believes Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is obviously a sexual pervert, but he seems to have what he wants with the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-boyfriend who ran away with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be affected by his continued cheating and getting hold of actions. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure most young people from 13 to 21 have already seen this movie, but it really doesn't have the age limit to enjoy it. So, if you haven't seen it and want to have a little laugh, with social comments, then go to your video store and rest from the deep and depressing independent movies. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from top to bottom.
