This series was like what you would expect from Mr Spielberg. It's really one of those scary, fun, childish shows that you won't forget. Like Outer Limits (another great show), this little series does what can't do much. It was amazing and deserved to run longer. It was a good show that even children could see, although some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted to be, but everyone always had a morale in the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you didn't want to end in, or those you did. I remember seeing some of these on Sci-fi when I was 10, and even now I still enjoy watching them whenever I can. Really a fun, imaginative show. I loved it and still do.
