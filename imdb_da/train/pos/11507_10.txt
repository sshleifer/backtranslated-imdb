I remember the original series alive most because of the unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject. Kolchak was the hard-bitten newsman from the Ben Hecht school in metropolitan reporting, and his gritty determination and wise abstinence even made the most secular episode very attentive. My personal fave was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of the very original story. A poor, troubled Cajun youth from Louisiana Bayou country participates in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis. Something inexplicably goes wrong, and he dreams of life's life about a swamp being in his youth's dark folklore. This malicious manifestation seeks all people who have done the dream in their conscious state and brutally swallow them to death. Kolchak examines and uncovers this awful truth, much to police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderful essayed by a grumpy Keenan Wynn) and head sleep researcher game by Second City improv founder, Severn Darden, for droll, underrated perfection. The wickedly fun, harrowing finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is a series of highlights. Kolchak never got any better. Timeless.
