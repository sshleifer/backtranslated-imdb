This is just at the top of my list of the most hysterically fun shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half of the jokes. This shows Izzard as the brilliant gifted comedian he is. What I especially think is that he apparently never "dumbs" the material to his audience. His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags. Thumbs up the road.
