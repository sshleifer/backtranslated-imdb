This movie should not be compared to "The Sting" or any other caper / heist / con game movie. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, fraud and trust. It is also a rather sharp criticism of psychiatry, as the female protagonist is a shrink that so easily lurks and then acts in such a primitive manner in the final. Has Mr. Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly recommended!
