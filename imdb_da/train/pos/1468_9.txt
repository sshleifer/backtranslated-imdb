The person who wrote the review "enough with sweat and spits already" has no understanding of what cultural, literary or mental criticism is. He rejects Zizek's interpretations because they do not seem "in line" with what the director originally intended. So what? The importance of an instructor's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. This is known as the author's "intentional error" and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or movie can be analyzed through a variety of theories, many of which they disagree with each other, and completely ignore the author's intention. This is the most basic idea of ​​critical theory. Because of this, who wrote this wall of text wasted much time and effort to insult Zizek. In fact, anyone studying theory will immediately discredit this boy's opinion (I suggest you should too), as it is completely incapable. <br /> <br /> That being said ... If you are at all interested in Freudian, Laconian or Kristevian discourse, this movie is a must. It links these theories to popular movies, making them much more tangible and comfortable than just reading or thinking about them.
