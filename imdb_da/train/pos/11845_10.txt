I really don't like both Shrek movies. (Since they both have "PG" and have words in them, I will never tell myself so I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: The Stallion in Cimarron", as I hardly saw for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, except Pixar. *** Forward of Spoilers *** In "Spirit: The Cimarron Stallion", a horseback is born and eventually becomes the leader of his flair. One night he sees a strange light in the distance and he sits down against it. This action eventually leads to his capture and more things. Throughout the film we hear a story. It is through the thoughts of the Spirit, even if the horses never speak. That's what makes the movie so goo. The (filmmakers) traveled real horses to make the sounds the horses made; None of these sounds were made by humans. Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful jumper and Little Creek, a native American who owns Rain. Little Creek later releases the spirit and rain they go home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack for this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't regret it. My score: 10/10
