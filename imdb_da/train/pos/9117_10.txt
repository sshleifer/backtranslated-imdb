This movie gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We as an African people owe it to ourselves to make a change in this cycle of "all talk and no action" and begin to realize to make a change that needs less talk and more action. It is a powerful account of our peoples' breakdowns over small issues and ours need to recognize the bigger picture and the need to reconcile to make a difference. Despite its reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message that this film seeks to portray.
