Night Listener drew my attention, with Robin Williams shining like a New York City radio host who is enchanted with his friendship with a very sick 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin). Williams has never met the boy personally, as they have only been in contact by talking on the phone. However, Williams Williams ex-boyfriend (nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy asking Williams to arrange a meeting with him personally. The following has a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I'll leave it by that. Toni Collette also stars. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, with Toni Collette giving a memorable depiction of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh star also as Williams' friend. Inspired by actual events, Night Listener has a bleak, almost eerie silence throughout. Sometimes it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before I watched the movie and just because of logic, but I liked it anyway. I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more than his comic characters, so that was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8.10
