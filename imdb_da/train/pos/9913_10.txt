Besides being an extremely fun movie, I must add that costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind of fun loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were eager to get their hands on their money. This woman was lonely since her husband died. He had suggested her in a theater that was to be broken down. To prevent it, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid she threw "their" money and decided to act. The character of the actors in this movie was also a good plus. I would give almost everything to get a copy of this movie in my video library, but it has never been released. Sad.
