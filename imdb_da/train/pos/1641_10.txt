I saw it 25 years ago at PBS. It was very hard to see. So right. To see this little family camp in the winter was heart rending. No Time to Court: Fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders on the gate and make it work. This was based on the woman's actual diary, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their ailments and sisters had to work in the yard to feed themselves. She learned to cut, which was not lady-like. She was afraid that no prince's charming would have a woman with tanned, shaken hands, but this man was so happy that his new wife knew how to beat, and she was happy to do so. Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. It was so sad when the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been fine. It only makes the tragedy extra sad. I cried so hard. But then they went out and beat a new calf successfully. Spring is coming and life continues. In her diary she had two more boys and they lived.
