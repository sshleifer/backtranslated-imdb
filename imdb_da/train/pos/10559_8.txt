I haven't written a review on IMDb for the longest time, but I felt compelled to write this! When I looked at this movie, I found a special review that did NOT encourage people to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! Nothing is a great movie, full of laughs and above all ... fantasy! Aren't you sick and tired of being forced to feed the same old cycle of bubble-rubber trash? Sometimes a movie comes as nothing together and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not even like you do not like (even hate) the movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental influence on reputation and no negative assessment should discredit the film like that. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but don't try to tell people they shouldn't see it. We have our own thoughts and we want to thank our own thoughts. <br /> <br /> If my rating is good, I would say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself to a little eye-candy! See nothing!
