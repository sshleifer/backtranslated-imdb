After I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why was this movie so successful in the Korean box office?" Even thought the movie had a clever / unusal scenario, the play was not so good and the characters were not very interesting. To a Korean movie ... I liked the fighters. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was a little childish ... 6/10
