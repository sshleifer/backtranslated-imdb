Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who are often better than his material and almost always under appreciated. He's been in a ton of movies either as a heavy or a hero, and has the kind of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can deliver material that would sound ridiculous to get out of another actor and it is so good with him. He really seems to say what he says, no matter how clich√©, overt or stupid, which puts him in the league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's what made Tralogy to WALKING TALL so good, and the same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a big hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has much better than many of the better-known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not take you away from the action on the screen. To be honest, I have always enjoyed Greydon Clark's film, a non-nonsense director in the same vein as the 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gemstones in the late 80's, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true gravel and violence. I suppose if they reintroduce this with The Rock, a whole new audience comes to love it as much as I do.
