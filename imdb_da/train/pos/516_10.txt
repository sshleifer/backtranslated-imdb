One of the few best movies all the time. The change from black and white to color to the sky and the earth's sequences was director quality. The plot is extremely wise, the complete movie leaves you overwhelmed by all the human emotions, and even if a war movie does not discriminate. I must have seen this movie more than anyone else, and I never need it. It is a film that causes you to question your own mortality and beliefs about what happens after our death.
