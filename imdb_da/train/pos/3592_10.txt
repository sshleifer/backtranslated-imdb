Another strong chick flick. This time it is about Diana Gusman, who always gets into the games at school. Instead of being expelled, she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring. She is training to be a boxer and she meets adulterous Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a strong message to take your dreams and go with them even if someone does not believe in you (in this case her father does not believe in her). That alone makes the movie worth the price. Enjoy
