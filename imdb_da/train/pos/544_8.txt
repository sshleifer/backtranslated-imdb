I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first one (cottage by the lake), but instead of just killing women, he also kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are first, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club, and he describes Kimberley's last moments before she is thrown to the water, and secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his cellar straight before they go down to the set when she kisses him. These scenes were, for me, very intense and nitriding. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the film was bad, but because the movie was bad, I think there were times when you could see that nothing was wrong as if it was shot like a movie is like usually shot, you would not see "live" camera shooting, but then very little, you will notice movie errors. what went wrong??
