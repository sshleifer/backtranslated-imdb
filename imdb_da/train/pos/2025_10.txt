Anne Bronte's epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and people's living rooms. It's a great story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and broken marriages and a mothers struggle to keep her son away from her brutal husband. Its just like today's stories that we see and hear, and I think people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on possible true experiences the author had in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, it's a big version of the book and very moving. I'm sure Anne would have been happy with the way it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and great rankings.
