New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and falls fast; as the movie opens, Mr. Caine latest game flops on broadway. TV reviewers throw fun at Caine and he gets drunk. Passing out on the Long Island Railroad lands Caine in Montauk, instead of its resident in East Hampton. Finally, Caine comes to comfort herself with tight-fitting Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunate, high-hearted patient. There, Caine and Mrs Cannon discuss a new game called "Deathtrap", written by hunky young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believes that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is a move that is needed to revive Caine's career. "The stair is set to an evil fun that will do it." <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-standing Broadway annoys too far from his stage origins. The casting is entertaining, and the winding of history is still exciting. One thing that didn't work (for me) was the curtain call ends; Certainly, it played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances are dead - but after greeting, greeting Reeve will give Caine at the East Hampton train station have been simplified to a smiling "hello". The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond are similar. And the very ballyhooed love scene is shockingly weak. But the game was so good, "even a gifted instructor couldn't destroy it." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
