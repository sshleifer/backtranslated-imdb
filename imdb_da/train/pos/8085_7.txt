One thing I can say about this movie is well long, very long! In fact, I recently purchased this movie a few months ago, as there was a new version that came out. I was happy to find out that it was made in 1978, because the 70s (though I never lived in them) are actually one of my favorite decades, especially for the music! when i saw this movie, the story was actually very good at first, but then after approx. 50 minutes it began to be very boring and repetitive. I will admit the animation impressed me! It was not something I had ever seen before and was pretty cold to see. but the film could honestly be a little better, it could be much more talk and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had fierce struggle. so in the last 5 or 10 minutes, the movie picked up and became good again but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion i thought it was extremely long. I know it 13 minutes in 2 hours, and it's still long after a cartoon, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it looked like it was 4 hours long !!!! but in general it is an okay movie I guess and I will see it again on one of these "nothing to do days". I want to see the new one and I hope it's better!
