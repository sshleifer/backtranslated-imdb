This movie, although over 70 years old, is still a very moving, powerful movie. Bette Davis, like the plain, evil Cockney waitress Mildred, is absolutely credible. Looking at her performance is still spell binding. She makes the viewer completely disdained and regrets her at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as the weak, occupied Phillip Carey is not that strong, but I can't see how any actor could hold herself against Mrs Davis's performance. She chews up the scenery in every scene she's in, totally stealing the show. This is the movie that sealed her stellar and she deserved to win the Academy Award but lost. It was shocking that it is today what about themes of unwanted pregnancy, more sex partners and Mildred's evil language, so it's somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she really likes about him ("You cad, you filthy pigs ....") are still some of the best plays I've ever seen on movies.
