As a fan of looking into the phenomenon of acting, this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of video recordings by the two troubled men (I cannot refer to people who kill as boys or teenagers), the preparation months lead to zero day (the code name for the day they will attack) the film is trying to present the situation from it opposite end of the gun. It seems to point out the pain they are suffering from, but focuses on the literal preparation. The problem is that a little with regard to emotions is directly delivered. The only point where the feeling became overwhelming was the end as expected. But up to this point, it is never quite clear why they are planning this. We are told the obligatory story that they were deceived, but the film also seems to be contrary to this. Without destroying the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and had just as good intentions, but became concise due to sloppy film making. All directing is amateur, to promote the homemade video concept, but history and continuity are weak. The movie seems to have the audience to decide a lot, but also does not provide the information about such an event. The end is abrupt and doesn't feel like it's done with everything the movie started.
