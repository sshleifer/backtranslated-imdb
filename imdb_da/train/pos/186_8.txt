There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could trade with the right property; she is wonderful in comic roles. William Haines could trade and you can see why he was one of the most popular screen men on the screen. (Until a potential scandal forced him from the company). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit tired but handled so beautifully that you don't notice. King Vidor's direction is one of the main reasons for this. The manufacturer? The boy's genius, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about film making, and you'll see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors, and actors against. You will see (briefly) some of the greatest stars of the day; Even Charlie Chaplin makes a trip like herself and seeks an autograph. You also get a glimpse of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are otherwise only names and old photographs. Even if you are not a fan of the stilts, take the time to catch this movie whenever you can. It's really a great trip back in time.
