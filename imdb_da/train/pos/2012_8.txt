This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and some fun bits. I laugh at Millie every time, the virgin pretends to be a d√©butante, holding her lovely hanky while chatting, and thoughtlessly polishing furniture with it while she talks. I can just never get past her French accent, which is never a problem as they try to pass her on as the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> See a teen Mel Torme and the very young Frank Sinatra song is such a treat. My mother saw Frank Sinatra at a theater the same time this movie came out. She said they could not clear "bobby-soxers" between movies (these days one should not leave between showings). This movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young Frank was and allows you to also appreciate his early talent. And Victor Borge gets some of his routine in, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet, simple story. Very pleasent.
