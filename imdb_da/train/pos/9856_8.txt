(spoilers ??) <br /> I wasn't sure what to think about the movie. Not too much of a kids movie. Definitely should be monitored by a parent because it includes death and dying. But I was surprised that I was a little entertained by it. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes we had. (even less without the credits) And the trailer makes you believe that rodent is a head closet. But unfortunately they torture him. Right at the end of the movie. These two gripes docked the film 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for a successor. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
