Writer director Brian De Palma is best known for his film string, which has been called, somewhat unfair, "Hitchcock imitations." Unlike popular belief, De Palma does not receive Hitchcock; He borrows history or character elements that may have been seen in a Hitchcock movie and then expands them in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for blending blood-blooded death with macabre humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", made back in 1980, is perhaps De Palma's best-known Hitchcockian movie, and it's probably his best too. The story involves a cross-dressing serial killer who stalks both a burnt-out housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street-wise hooker (played by Nancy Allen). Yes, it will point you clearly out of "Psycho", but De Palma's flick is just as technically brilliant and darkly creative. The order of the museum is particularly well-tried and edited; Elevator staff scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it is definitely worth your time. Nominal R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10
