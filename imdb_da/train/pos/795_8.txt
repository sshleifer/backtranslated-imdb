Too bad a few comments for me do not know the facts in this case. It is based on actual events, a very published disappearance and killing in Wilmington, the DE / Philadelphia PA region from '96 to 2000. I have to admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize the actual story and events and was In fact, quite impressed with how close they were to what was constantly reported on local news and Philadelphia Inquirer news stories throughout the period. Of course, I immediately pointed out that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case) who played Fahey looked nothing like her (Anne Marie was actually more beautiful). I have to admit that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capanos and the behavior Capano exhibited throughout this period. Details of the case were right ... no deviations of dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet, gun, furniture and cooler. In conclusion, I would also like to add that I have met Tom Carper many times in various functions (a good man, despite being a politician), and I am so glad that he has drawn the strings of the federal kingdom that are necessary to solve this horrific crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally laying behind bars.
