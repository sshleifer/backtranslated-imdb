This movie surprised me! Not ever having heard of Hyde of Gackt, I didn't expect much! The reason I wanted to watch the movie was because someone mentioned that the movie featured some serious action scenes in John Woo style! Usually I am very careful when this is claimed! There is only one John Woo, and to this day there has not been a director coming close to his glory when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" wanted a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with gun-blowing vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was that the pace was considerably slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie features some fine Hong Kong style action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama of friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship with each other! Pop singer Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very trustworthy as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A couple of times, the movie seems to skip a couple of years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! Example: When a member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang Kei (Hyde) sees drinking blood from one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the film goes over 9 nine years, and most friends are no longer together! Also, without a proper reason, son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know this is done to add some serious dramas! Because of the actors it is very effective, but sometimes it feels forced! Apart from the flaws in the plot, this movie has a mood and slickness that makes it hard to dislike this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But that's just! The overall experience you get is cordial and sincere!
