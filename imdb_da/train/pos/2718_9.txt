Last year we were treated to two films about Truman Capote, who wrote the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. I can't imagine a movie like this one was made in 1967. A strong, powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a movie classic by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on Hot Tin Roof, Professional, Blackboard Jungle). Interestingly, Robert Blake, who starred in this movie has had so many problems late that may be related to his depiction of a killer in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after viewing.
