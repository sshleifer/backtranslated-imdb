Now all children and teenagers in Springwood, Ohio are all dead for a teenager (Shon Greenblatt) still lives. Freddy (Robert Englund) lets him go, and the teenager doesn't have much about a memory when he arrives at a new city. When a hard woman psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to care about the new patient. She finds out where he is from. She brings him to Springwood to spark some memories, but three teens (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan) who unexpectedly came to the trip. When they arrived at Springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she lived in the city before as a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of his true identity. Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) made a mischievous but somewhat oddly different sequel with visual style and fun moments for this horror. / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a supportive role as a psychologist's expert on dreams. This has some brilliant visual effects (Not everyone will love climax, especially in 3-D) and some good style in his storytelling. The DVD has a strong anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the original theatrical trailer, Hop to a Nightmare opinion and Cast & Crew information. "Elm Street" Series Box Set, the eighth disc has interviews with cast & crew on this sixth movie. The sixth movie is also in 3-D for movie climax, but you could watch it on 2-D as well. This is the last of the "Elm Street" movies until Wes Craven revived Freddy for another darker style in "New Nightmare" and the stupid but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror movie "Freddy VS Jason". Look for Robert Shaye (Co-Owner and Co-CEO of "New Line Cinema"), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in entertaining cameos.
