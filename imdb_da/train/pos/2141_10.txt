Masayuki Suo, who directed this fine film, has a role. Following the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classic (in Japan, yet) college sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo has followed his own great footsteps with an excellent success. <br /> <br /> The story is engaging. We both often laugh (Naoto Takenaka is fun as he is in Suo's two previous films) and really rooted in the characters. But for me, the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer to Japanese society - the real life in Japan. Suo has the ability to show real activities with entertaining flair. The result is a movie that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and both entertain you and give you insight into today's Japan.
