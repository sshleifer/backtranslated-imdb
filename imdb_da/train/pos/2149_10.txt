Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is one we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly credible. The result is so moving, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without seemingly athletic. Mai's graceful dance and charm gave me goose bumps. Tamako is such a wonderful lovely character. You can almost see the charming schoolgirl in her face as she remembers seeing the "King and I". Aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is as overwhelmingly natural as the confused wife, you will almost hug her to assure her that everything is in order. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a keeper.
