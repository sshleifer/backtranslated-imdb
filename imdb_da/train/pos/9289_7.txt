In BARBARIAN AND GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a true United States envoy responsible for truly opening up Japan for international relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry pushed deep into Japan with pistol boats and forced a treaty into Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived a little later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance - as many of the Japanese did not feel any particular propensity to honor it first treaty. All this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is mostly fiction, and this romance is much of a focus in this movie (hence the title). My first reaction the first time I saw this movie was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat?! When he's diplomatic in most movies, he says thank you and thank you for pummels people !!!! So watching him play a man who is NOT a fight and capable of playing the diplomatic game seemed very strange. In fact, I can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen pictures of Harris, and Wayne has virtually no resemblance to him. <br /> <br /> But despite history, many freedoms take with the truth and the weird casting, the film is still very visible. Color cinematography is great, the film shows some good insights into Japanese customs and culture and the play is not bad. All in all, a sweet and durable film, despite the strange casting. <br /> <br /> PS - Read through the trivia of this movie. You'll find out more about the real life figures as well as a presumably fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston), where Wayne apparently knocked him out !! Based on what I've read about Huston and how he came with actors, it's an event I usually believe. And it's also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
