Almost every review of this movie I had seen was pretty bad. It's not pretty bad, it's actually pretty good, but not good. Judy Garland's character could have been annoying, but she didn't allow it. Somewhere along the line I have become a fan of brooding, indulgent, excessive Van Heflin, at least in the early 40s. Judy's song is amazing, but the movie missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.
