Any screen customization of a John Grisham story deserves a common Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is about the last director I would go for for a regular recording on something. But this stewed pot-kettle is pretty good. Although it's not among Altman's best, it's certainly not among the films he's made that leave you scraping his head and wondering what he was thinking. Altman had tipped his hat to mysterious thriller with noir overtones earlier in his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye." "Gingerbread Man" is not as good as that movie, but it stays pretty good alone. Kenneth Branagh is a cocky lawyer who is framed for murder after being involved with a client (Embeth Davidtz) who has attracted her help to protect her from her godfather (Robert Duvall). The movie is set in Savannah, Georgia, during the entry of a tropical storm, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere that I liked very much. The turns towards the end of the movie become more lumpy and clumsy, and Altman does not turn out to be all the talents to shoot scenes, but generally the movie is not a bad addition to Altman's canon. <br /> <br /> Also starring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Degree: B
