I happened upon the "shower" in the foreign movie section of my local video store and passed it several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy. I looked lucky into a copy to buy at economical price and am happy with my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, a father, and two (2) adult sons, each expressing a change of life, as the world around them continues to change in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this film. In addition to the fascinating features of the local Chinese color that give the setting to this story, the difficult but touching relationship between men and a single woman is involved in history, all against a village bathhouse. <br /> <br /> The family history moves from transformation to understanding and made me happy to know these people. Added to the main story are the many small characters, bath house customers and their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a movie you walk away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity.
