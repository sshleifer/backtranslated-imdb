I watched this movie as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned Video Nasty 'Blood Rites'. Since the blood rites were horrible, I didn't expect much from this movie; But in reality, it seems that waste director Andy Milligan has left himself this time as Sin of His Tops Blood Rites in style and stands tall as a more than sufficient piece of sick sextier sex exploitation. The reason is actually very similar to Blood Rites as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; There is a legacy at stake. The film is shot in black and white and the look of it reminded me of a lot of the trash 'The Curious Dr Humpp'. There is hardly anything going on, and the director seems to be more aware of focusing on sex, with themes of incest and hatred that permeate. The action is typically unclear, but most of the women seem to be naked at some point, and despite a bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to be watching this kind of thing, as many of the sequences in this movie are actually pretty pretty . The plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler; But the music is eye-catching, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, as most are somewhat erotic. Overall, it's not a good movie; but it is likely to appeal to the cult fan and get a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'Blood Rites'.
