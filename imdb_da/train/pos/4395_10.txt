One of my favorite films, which has been overlooked by too many movie guests, is an observation that mystifies me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee, it had many young actors who were to become big stars, for example. Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the actors were amazing, and each of the actors mentioned made memorable performances, especially Meyers, depicting a vicious villain who killed to kill. <br /> <br /> When the director's biographies and achievements (even when he won an academic award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their previous performances. I accidentally discovered the movie on DVD and it became one of my most frequently watched movies. But it is rare for everyone to watch cable. I am looking forward to reading what others are suggesting why this movie is not known.
