I'm Italian, and when I recently watched this movie, I was amazed at its beauty: The first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I appreciate it with adult minds and feelings. Now I understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), when it had passed. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's epic movie is good ... for fun. Maybe this 'Odyssey' had no English version, because it's not enough fun ... not suitable for popcorn and the cola audience. However, suitable for homerpatos and existentialist reflections. In Italy, a very good DVD version was recently released: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but it is only Italian and without subtitles. Too bad: also the film's dialogues and voices are remarkable.
