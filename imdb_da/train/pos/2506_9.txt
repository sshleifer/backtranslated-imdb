Moon Child was one of the more symbolic movies I've seen. What I really liked about it was the illustration of immorality / mortality and the obstacles and guidance throughout life. The film depicts a great vampire Kei who has immoral power and the benefits of it. Whether it has supernatural abilities or eternal life, this is what people normally want. Moon Child shows the pain and the drawbacks of being immortal, as the emotions against loss affect almost all the characters especially to the protagonists Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title 'Moon Child' reveals when the film comes close to the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon shining other people's way and giving guidance. I personality resembles the moral film depicted on. The weaknesses of the film lie in some parts of the play and special effects, as it made the film less authentic. The scene in which character Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic feelings in the play were put into it. Some scenes with special effects like gun shots could also have been more authentic without being too much like an action video game. The sparks that came out of the guns seemed fake, and I think it could have been eliminated or fixed. Nevertheless, I believe that Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider watching. The symbolic ideas and images that the film brings out can easily be accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. It's a thought-provoking movie and also entertaining to watch.
