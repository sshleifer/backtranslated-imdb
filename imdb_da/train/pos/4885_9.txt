Possible spoilers re: delayed comos <br /> <br /> Rarely do you see so many fine and memorable character actors (almost exclusively actresses being precise) in a movie. Although a couple only appears for cameos, each is a gem. The British make this blend of comedy and real pathos better than any IMO, so it's not surprising that most of the actors are British. The music is amazing; undoubtedly it was a lot to be called (Leslie Caron * really * plays the bass so well? maybe - who knew it?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her hot visceral sound still turns my tissue like few other jazz singers. <br /> As an aging musician himself, not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course, it was also a cordial movie - a great movie for anyone wondering if they are past it in their profession or afocation whatever it may be. And of course a great celebration of the scene's life. <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of the opening, but a tentative 9/10 - and it certainly does, we want to see the whole thing.
