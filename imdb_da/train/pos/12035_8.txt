I recently stumbled upon this movie on TNT five minutes into it while I was on vacation in Florida ... (hello, there should be some time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature-length movie on TNT. I mean "Drive Me Crazy" is not that old, is it? <br /> <br /> But I stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer excellent. The beneficiary (Nick, former wife's boyfriend; Karen, her best friend and her life-controlling parents) added a great deal of credibility. The twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl, who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
