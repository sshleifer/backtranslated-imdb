Louise Brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well-crafted French melodrama. She plays a typographer named Lucienne, who, despite being in love with a man named Andre, dreams of rising above her position in life. She sees the opportunity in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he discovers she has come in, so she demands to retire. She tries to go back to her admission to discover that she has already been chosen as Miss France and will now move on to the main game. <br /> <br /> This is a story of love, loss, and decision played out to its passionate end. The film is very energetically recorded by director Augusto Genina and the cinematographers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The movie's style is more like a modern movie than the Hollywood flicks of the 30s and shows the different style that Europeans are dealing with. There are many quick cuts and travel shots, mostly done with great skill and enlistment. The high energy in the film's first third drops slightly in the middle, but retrieves the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The show was very good by all the instructors, but the one by Louise Brooks is especially memorable. Louise puts heavy on her silent screen skills, even though it is a talkie, but because she posed style had a surprisingly modern, discreet feeling, she made the transition to talkies very good. The long early stage at the fair was particularly exciting when Louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation, to be trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt it has ever been done better. <br /> <br /> The film builds on a fantastic finale, artificially shot, powerful and stylish. These are really some of the best things in the film's early days. And the tragic story only emphasizes the greater tragedy that this is the ultimate role of Louise Brooks. She was not only a great beauty, who looked great in a swimsuit, she was really a great actor talent who pretty much threw it all away. We are all poorer for it. <br /> <br /> This movie is less known than her German movies with G.W. Pabst, but I think it's a better one. I think this crew member is better at storytelling than Pabst, and although the Prix de Beaute lacks the deep moral complexity of the Pabst movie, it is much easier to follow and is generally a more streamlined, focused work. And it doesn't hurt that Louise's song parts are also made by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is a classic Louise Brooks movie worth watching.
