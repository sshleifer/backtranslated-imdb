At that time, this film had controversy over it (like most of Verhoeven's projects). <br /> <br /> Contains very graphic images deaths; A parachute that doesn't open * smack * fire the body on the floor. A guy is eaten by a Lion * Chomp * throat. And a guy is driven over by a speedboat * zoom * bloody body goes down. <br /> <br /> But besides gore, this flick also contains some brilliant (and amazingly beautiful) scenes recorded in the gray fishing village that is the Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds fly over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (sacred) woman putting flowers in a milk jug, surrounded by plates of blood-dripping meat and a steaming love scene between two male signs in a cemetery. The story is finished with a shady but fulfills 10 minutes, which does not disappoint and will let you sigh a breath. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the pros, the disadvantages come, some special effects are too over-the-top, and of course it is done to see how far the Verhoeven could push the gore factor (eg, more eyeballs hanging out of their plug). Although the two main actors (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, Herman's character (depicted by the rather un-charming Thom Hoffman) feels very underdeveloped and makes him hard to care for, even after his tragic death. I've done my best to give you a little idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing movie, and as you can see, it's not easily summed up in words. So do yourself a favor if you happen to find this movie somewhere, see it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
