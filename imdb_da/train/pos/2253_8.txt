I rented this movie because of my interest in American history and especially the strange story of Mormon. This film seeks to make some sense of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a greater world religion. It first focuses on the problems the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. It depicts the experiment at Joseph Smith. During this trial, Brigham Young is in charge of telling his conversion to Mormonism and of his faith in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is murdered, and Young has to deal with his own doubts as to whether he has been elected to lead the Mormons to a new country. Despite his serious doubts, he continues and finally has a vision (that Utah is the site of his colony) that gives him confidence in the right of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has really been selected - yet a miracle arises that cements his place in history. <br /> <br /> I found the performances moving, and the story must be compelling and interesting. I would like to know if Mormons believe that this is a precise portrayal. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS have not been raised. The question is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people are getting away from this movie because of its religious subject, but it has a great cast and will keep your interest all the way through.
