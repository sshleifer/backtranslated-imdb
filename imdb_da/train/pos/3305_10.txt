Without a doubt, this film must be one of the biggest ....... in film history. I've seen it too many times to remember, and each time it's like I watch the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of his career, followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every move and nuance of her performance makes any other Bollywood heroine pale meaningful. Her masterful interpretation of Kathak combined with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu, is like nothing ever seen on the Bollywood screen. Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; Photography, sumptuous filmography and mise a scene are so enthusiastic about symbolism and meaning that the viewer remains spirit-free. Naushad's music is unmatched, his knowledge of music from courtesan gharanas is incredible, and the way he draws the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic tunes is actually remarkable. My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the play of the overall cinema should see this epic mediation on life and art.
