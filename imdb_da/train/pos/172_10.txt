I watched this movie on Comedy Central a couple of times. This movie was pretty good. It's an interesting adventure with Sunny David's life, designed to marry the King of Ohtar, so the United States can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also loved the final theme. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
