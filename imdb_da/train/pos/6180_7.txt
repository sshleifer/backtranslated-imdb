During Vantie's opening day, a woman was found dead on the catwalk over the stage. As the show continues, the police are trying to collect who killed who and why before the last curtain. <br /> <br /> I had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so I was thrilled to find myself a copy. Unfortunately, no one has told me about the music tracks that are going on and on and on. While the numbers are certainly the type that Hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they virtually stop the film dead despite attempts to weave action around them. It wouldn't be that bad if the music was half decent, but it wasn't. There is only one good song. Worse, the study knew that they had a song, Cocktails for Two, and we are forced to endure four versions of it: a duet, a large production number, like the Vanities Final and in the background as random music. I don't think Spike Jones and his City Slickers have ever played so much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen sparring neatly with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny, his scenes as an actress in love with the wardrobe lover. To no significant extent, I can recommend this if you think you can get through the songs or are willing to scan through them. It's a fun movie of the kind they don't do anymore.
