Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor who examines a character he has chosen to play before making a commitment. Freeman is a "good fit" for this movie (as if he were "Driving Miss Daisy") and he is not only credible, but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a sign of reserved dignity and decency. While there are no guarantees in life, it gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out to avoid stereotyping. And it has to be said that stereotypes have hampered or completely destroyed a significant number of acting careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget movie, which was surprisingly made within just two weeks. It's a film that is well documented and written by Brad Silberling. The Location Manager selected Carson, CA for the movie's setting, and the location helps set the tone and timing of the movie. Editing is right for good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was 'subcontractor' to get Freeman to make this movie while the actor was between movie projects. <br /> <There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialogue between each of the cast members who are different and come from different cultures. The film also encourages understanding between people who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, peoples, principles and values. The film strives for some honesty and comes to some truth to preserve the integrity of the film. Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays a free actor who has been out of work for four years. In fact, Freeman is in demand as an actor that he constantly works. <br /> <br /> The movie offers an adventure of bonding, care, sharing, change and exchange. And the movie's expiry gives the viewer an example of some of the things an actor must go through when preparing for a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are taking a 'mental health day' and go see this movie. If you are able to, take your significant other or your family with you. I rank the movie a 10 out of 10. It's fun, interesting, informative, exciting and worthwhile.
