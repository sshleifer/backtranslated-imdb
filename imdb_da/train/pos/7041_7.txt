WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergey Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> A hit-and-miss 21's "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who wrote with the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser ?? stars like a beaten man named Brand Hauser, who is burnt out, but decides to go through a final task by glazing a Middle Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, it's not Omar Sharif, but you get the tone from this misfire for a laugh), which was ruled by the ex-vice president of the United States (Aykroyd, Cusack's old "Grosse Pointe Blank" co-hort, makes an average Dick Cheney maneuver trip here) that uses Brand to do the act under cover of a trade Show producer in mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the American private company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> While being briefed, Brand stands with a moment of clarity as he crosses the unreal journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Tamerlane sponsors the unlikely association of Eastern European teenage feelings Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff who picks up her own celebrity with tongue-through-cheek) and the idiot's son of the country's leader. <br /> The following is a bold attempt at a 21st century black comedy on "DR. STRANGELOVE", but for all intense purposes, unfortunately, there are more misses than hits in this broad attempt at laughing in the midst of political message (an unfair war While outsourced by American capitalism, check!) While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned "Pointe" he adds some fine details of his black man (he makes shots of Tabasco sauce to take the edge off), the rest of The cast games catch (except Sister Joan, who is a rebellion as the high-end camp for Hauser and has one of the movie's funniest ridiculous lines: "My mass communication skills eventually pay off") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the Iraq war earlier this year in 180 degree different "Grace is Gone" and here he allows his political views on his sleeve; Whilst it is admirable, the movie's pace and rhythms are largely not due to the first time filmmaker Joshua Seftel makes his direct debut here (and it can be seen), except perhaps the well-choreographed battle Hauser is involved in Babyyeah's idiotic fiancÃ© . /> A good attempt yet another misconception; Maybe next time Cusack will not try so hard and let the warriors idiots speak for themselves instead of making the heavy lifting of themselves.
