I'm glad I watched this movie after seeing some of the director's other movies in the past. I thought the production values ​​were great as the costumes and settings with the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons was handled. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments on battle scenes. They were difficult to follow at times. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a moral tale. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers believed in the movie. It's a movie I want to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like those where Benkai and the prince fought at a "mental" level were well done. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinema and wondered what just happened here. Intense.
