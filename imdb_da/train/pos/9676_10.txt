The movie was very sweet and hearty! I almost cry every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie to each one. The movie was so inspiring to me. The actors did a good job and the movie played very well. The film was about a little girl who owned a parrot, with which she was named Paulie. Paulie had been separated from her by the parents because they thought it would be best for her. <br /> <br /> After having seen so many people, Paulie ended up in a cage by himself in a basement. Finally, this Russian man who had got a job in a place like a watchman. Had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie started talking to him to tell him the story of his life. Finally, the man helped Paulie with Marie (the little girl who traveled Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
