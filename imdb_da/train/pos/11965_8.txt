Reading a lot of "Scoop" reviews over the last few days, I entered the theater prepared for a subpar excursion from Woody. Fortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong. Granted, the Woody practitioner lowers a touch or two, but Woody the author / director is in good shape - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year-old himself into history. Judging by laughter and guffaws, the audience ate Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way I haven't seen for years. <br /> <br /> In a movie landscape dominated by software-acclaimed story arches, twentysomething tasting and line-of-sight formula prize for kids, it is a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his very personal and ever-giving path.
