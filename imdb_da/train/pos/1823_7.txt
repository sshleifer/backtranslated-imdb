I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never saw it after that. The second day I was a kid and my cousin never saw all the dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and saw them together today and he really loved these movies. So many memories came back on this movie, and I have to admit that I even cried a little. I am 22 years old and the end still comes to me. All dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated movies and I am honestly shocked by this rating of 5.8, I thought this movie would bring good memories back to others as well. I admit the animation was a bit typical, but the story is just so charming and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a gambling dog killed by another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he comes back to Earth with a clock that can't stop ticking, or it's the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spy on him, they find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan girl who speaks to animals and finds out who should win the races . Charlie takes the girl Ann-Marie and makes false promises to get the money. But he ends up learning that perhaps he should put Ann-Marie first before himself when Carface returns to him. <br /> <br /> All dogs going to heaven are the perfect family movie, it's not Disney, but this is an excellent family movie to watch. Not to mention that it's just so sweet and touching. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie to me when I was a kid made me think dogs have souls. How could they not? They are just so loving, and I think I'm going to cry again. But still, I just recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
