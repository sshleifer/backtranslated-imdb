Hi again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and credible story of romance and intrigue. The music in wonderful and memorable. Very good colorful movie. Another movie I also liked later was the High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thanks for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
