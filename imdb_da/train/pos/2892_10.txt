Cinderella .... I didn't see this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that certainly contains the history book feel, the songs entertain and the secondary character is all, thank you. The villains in the form of step-daughters are completely evil and in vain. Then there is the most magical of all Disney, the mice do dress and well you know the rest. In summary, the four Disney Princess films are all good, but it is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy. Oh and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others, the film has such a feeling for it, you just can't help but smile <br /> <br /> They say morally of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some believers are hopeful. In this movie, it is even more magical when her rainbow comes smiling. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest ... Cinderella
