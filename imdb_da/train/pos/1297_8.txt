Credible adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed medieval software engineer (or something) that relies heavily on first-person narrative, but no worse for it. Downbeat (in a bourgeois way), philosophical and black humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no respect for the CB plan). Murderous fun, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relationships, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognizable way that you ask: why aren't other movies like this? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good movie.
