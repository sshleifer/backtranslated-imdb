This for me was a wonderful introduction to Marion Davie's talents and beauty. She is not only beautiful but fun in this movie. (I think Lucille Ball might have modeled his later career on Davies' style that could be described as "zany beauty.") Vidor's direction is light but safe hand, history is a chestnut of course, but the play is wonderfully modern , and the star cutter for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds the overall fun. It combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. For all movie fans who have a knee-jerk action to watch quiet movies, sit through it and it can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
