Despite the other comments mentioned here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects - for better or worse - the country's socio-political feelings during Reagan's glory in the early 80s. It's also a kickass action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening with a liberal female judge overthrows a murder due to lack of tangible evidence and then goes straight into the coffee bar's meeting with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene that asks for the famous "Go ahead, low my day "line", "Sudden Impact" is a non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you catch the weather is when the cumbersome inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered cap. It only gets better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque bullies for Callahan dealing with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and a hilarious script sometimes help make this movie one of the best 80s.
