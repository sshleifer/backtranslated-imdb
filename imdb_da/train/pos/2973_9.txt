Here's a movie that's really fun every moment it covers. How can it not be said that this movie stars are the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I didn't immediately understand that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they were really Matt and Trey later. Humor is sometimes raw, sometimes fuzzy, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes high and sometimes stupid, but generally it is a hell of a movie that is undoubtedly under character. Well, actually, it's crazy. Absolutely crazy.
