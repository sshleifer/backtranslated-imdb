This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to watch DVD year after the PBS broadcast, with a sharper image and sharper sound. My only caveat is that the plot has a few unlikely moments, and that some of the strongest Manchester accents are difficult at times. Fortunately, a word is missing here and there will not spoil the fuss: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings a mysterious smile, a huge temperament and an athletic physical body to his role as a young surgeon who hopelessly falls for his boss's wife in the hospital where he has just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her plays compete with her beauty. (The love scenes between these two show better than words, how little the age difference means to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and well portrayed. The mixture of pithy dialogue and passionate profits makes this a wonderful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you can't be more morally improved by looking "ruthless" - but you want lots of fun. (The sequel, part of the DVD box set, gives a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You won't miss it if you've enjoyed what happened before.)
