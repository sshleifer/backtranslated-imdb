I'm a Kung Fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun play. Now martial arts; *it is beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a very entertaining Kung Fu movie that almost * has too much * battle if that is possible! These are good things. Many of the battle scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are entertaining and sympathetic. The bad ones are a bit too incredibly evil, but entertaining nonetheless. You must see the Sleeping Wizard !! He can only fight when he sleeps - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> However, with repeated prospects, Last Hurray For Chivalry may tend to be a bit boring and long-lasting, especially because many of the battle scenes aren't actually that good. Therefore, I consider it "only" a 7 out of 10. But it's really almost an "8". All in all, one of the better kung fu movies that made smack-dab in the heart of the Kung Fu cinema's prime. All the really good Kung Fu movies are from mid to late 1970s, with some notable exceptions from the late 60s and early 70s (and early 80s, to be fair).
