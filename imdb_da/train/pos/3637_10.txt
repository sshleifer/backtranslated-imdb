This was really a wonderful movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very sympathetic actor who is very funny to watch. The chemistry team, when they got things together, was spectacular, it just goes to show what you can achieve when the minds unite as one with one goal. This team came back from the brink and had several lost seasons to win almost everything. I love movies like this as they really are very inspiring. <br /> <br /> Besides, Dennis Quaid's character is getting somewhere in the big leagues. You can't do anything but mess for this guy. It just seems like someone has to do something they have to do. It just happens to fall into place and does everything possible. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really make you think that "nothing is impossible".
