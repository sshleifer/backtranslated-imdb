Everyone should watch this movie because every one of us is somehow broken and it can help us realize 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) How important is it to adopt a children in need. There are so many out there. Believing that the film was actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world has and always will be. Corrupt, but corruption does not have to reach your home. We all have a choice! Definitely recommend this one ... and while on it, I'd like to throw in "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
