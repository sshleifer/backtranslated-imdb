In my years of participating in film festivals, I've seen many small movies like this one that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in $ 3 bins at WalMart. I just found the DVD of Yank Tanks there, good doc, but how sad it ends up in a bottomed residue. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, wish I had seen it at the cinema in it's everything. I would have preferred New Yorker Films to have translated the title directly. It's good for Americans to stretch a little. If the movie's title helps the American audience explore random chaos, the better. Cinema mimics life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> I also found it distracting that the subtitles priced in dollars. Come on! The euro is not hard to figure out, make the gringo audience do the math. Watching a movie, especially a shot in Paris, the viewer should not have the confused effect of being reminded of it: I am American to watch a movie and they translate the euro into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the author and director as well.
