Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny's" theme is reused from many films spanning many different years. Its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots (see "Scrooged") to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in "It's a Wonderful Life" and a century earlier in the story of Scrooge as explained by Charles Dickens in "A Christmas song . " "It involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life and witnessing how his life could have been (or would have been) first hand. <br /> <br /> In most of these types of movie is guardian angel saves a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect or how it could have been. Should have been. Would have been. In this case, we are shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi). He lives with an unexciting wife (Linda Hamilton) and longs for a greater life of greater importance.If he had only hit the ball at the high school championship years ago, he is convinced that his life would have been better. remember this seemingly small moment in his life because it had a great influence on his subconscious side, but I doubt that an adult man would long for a single high school action. It still works in the movie. <br /> <br / > Anyway, Larry queue goes home from work one night, when he is a penpusher with Jon Lovitz, when hey car breaks down. He walks into a bar looking for a payphone and decides reluctantly to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) how his life is facing. This is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike. <br /> <br /> The bartender listens and nods, apparently not worrying for other customers. This is probably due to the bar, though old and tattered, apparently never been occupied by any living people, saving these two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. This is probably for some reason that the audience expects before Larry. <br /> <br /> So, the bartender, who can also be an angel of God, like Clarence, directs Larry to a special drink from him that ends up putting Larry's life on the back and showing him what his life would have been as if he had hit the home all these years before. But Larry has no idea of ​​any change at first, as Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence had erased his life until he entered the bar and was kicked out. Larry continues to be unaware of any change until he goes home to find the grass differently outside, and a great, wrestler-type man occupies his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon finds out that his life would have been very different if he had hit the home. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and moved into a large mansion with children. He finds out that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend, but an employee of his. And the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life, Larry has always wanted ... he finds himself loosely after his old wife, Linda Hamilton; Evidence that sometimes money and a splendid yet shallow wife does not matter in a person's life, as an intelligent wife and love and true happiness. Just as "It is a wonderful life" showed the audience a person's life is what he does, and that every person has an influence on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, a lesson taught us again and again, but never quite as fluffy, forgettable and really sweet as it is shown to us in "Mr. Destiny." <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is never extremely fun, but it is a sweet, good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with everything "It is a wonderful life" retreads out there, like "The Family Man", is that they are trying to be as influential and memorable as "It is a wonderful life" was. But there are only so many times that you can easily tear a famous movie and "Mr. Destiny" knows it and plays right. It is not trying to be something it is not; Rather, it is something it did not try to be, and it is clear to the public. <br /> <br />
