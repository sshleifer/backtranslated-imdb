It is very true for the original manga of the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in the United States), but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read manga. It is another kind of tail that shows a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. Because of her outward strength, however, she fears to show her inner feelings and thus let her around her hurt her with their silent comments. The only one who really gets her out and who she can be comfortable with is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something other than the normal boring thing with some amazing J-Dorama (Japanese drama) actors / resses then this is definitely the series to watch ... and read!
