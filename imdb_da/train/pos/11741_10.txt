This tender beautifully crafted production deep down bitterly sweet in my being. The irreverent students, the life-driven bus driver and the teachers' personalities present a subliminal debate that history reveals. The grown-up characters seem to know, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions so plausible and familiar. When a key event happens on the bus, we are sent on a circuit with views. Nevertheless, the tower's energy savings are only kept under the control of the tour operators. Sir. Harvey experiences a lot of pain throughout. He reminds me of war-injured teachers, I didn't understand when I was an irreverent student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much appreciation for this well-formed British film. The actress, the scene is appropriate, it should be widely available, but does not seem to have the right opportunity.
