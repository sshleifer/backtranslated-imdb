I was 5 years old when I watched this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later it is still an original inspiration to achieve my goals that I have started since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of the entertainment industry's hard core during the late 50's depicts the "Sparkle" success of three young sisters seeking their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could happen when things seem to happen too quickly, and role models are not available to borrow a helping hand. The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield carries the soundtrack plotted with each song. From being exposed to situations that hardly make any choice for strong long-term decision making, to make the ultimate sacrifice to move on, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent the various routes you could take when setting out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This movie might have created the ideas of "Dreamgirls" on Broadway and Mariah Carey's "Glitter", 25 years later. As an original audience member in both productions, I have seen many similarities in both stories to "Sparkle" as well as in "Saturday Night Fever", "Fame", "Flashdance" and off-Broadway smash hit "Mama, I will sing."
