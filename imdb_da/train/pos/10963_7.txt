I find it very exciting that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin from these women, would encourage Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a movie. They could certainly be considered the "skeletons" of the family cabinet. The extra features of the DVD include several modern fashion designers who credit some of their ideas to these oddball women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion of these designers fascinating. (ie "Are they nuts? Or am I missing something?"). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix doesn't. Facets do, however.
