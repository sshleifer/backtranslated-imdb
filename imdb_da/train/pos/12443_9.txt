I enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> A number of people do not like the movie, but it must be seen in the context of the origin story that it is. The movie uses flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman she became. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. The pace is slow and for my taste there are not enough tensions developed in today's scenes. But it is acceptable just to get such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you will enjoy it yourself with mistakes if you just want an action girl with a car - forget it. <br /> <br /> It has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as I have never seen it promoted anywhere, I suppose that will no longer follow. Unfortunately.
