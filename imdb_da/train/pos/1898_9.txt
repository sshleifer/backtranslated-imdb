The father of Who's alcoholic drummer, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who usually OVERAKTS, did a good job in this and could turn cheek on Dudley Moore in every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely all the scenes. It was a very "different" movie that allowed the viewer to gain an insight into another life. We often try to resume this movie on satellite. God rests Dudley Moore; It was such an enjoyable movie. Very satire and thumb down to the rich and snobbish / wealthy. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite excellent.
