BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the most amazing movies ever made. I was fortunate enough to capture it with a Q&A session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie should be seen as believed! I sincerely recommend searching Trent's name on the internet and then buying the movie from his site. He's an incredibly good guy to start. Don't be confused: The camera man in the fictional section of BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent! <br /> <br /> Having seen TRILOGY a couple of times, I must admit that I could probably do without Sean Penn version. It's like a try-out version for the Crispin Glover "Orkly Kid" section and is interesting more like a curiosity object if you're a Penn fan than it is a good video. However, Penn is quite fun and you can see a big star in this grim B&B. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of Crispin Glover's best roles, and I just want to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin 'Gary. When you watch this movie, you never get Gary's nervous laugh out of your head again.
