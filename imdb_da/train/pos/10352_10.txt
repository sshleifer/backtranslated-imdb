Religious bigotry is fierce everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> A dingo talked a baby and the mother was tried and sent to jail for "killing" her own baby. I don't mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before you get kneeled in what caused this woman to get into a prison. Buying or renting movies and discovering how profound human hatred for those who are different continues to thrive across the globe. <br /> <br /> Both are a very moving movie with a great actor. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with his famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are excellent. Those with supporting roles are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See it!
