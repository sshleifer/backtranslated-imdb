Cure is a great movie ... So exciting and just so REAL! I was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'The Cure' on it's NYC premiere and it totally blew me away! I also heard it won a prize from that festival and it certainly deserved it. The first thing that struck me was the cinematography. Eric Giovon did a fantastic job. The acting style of love scene halfway in the movie was amazing. A love scene was needed in this movie, and Jafri got pointer across, but also kept the scene tasteful. Giovon and Jafri make an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects. Judy Maier's story was so surreal, but at the same time heartbreaking, it made me feel what the protagonist felt. I'm a very tough critic, but I have to say The Cure is one of my favorite movies. Just love it! If you haven't seen it yet, check it out!
