The barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just as simple as that, and he succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful film, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow-motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. in a beautiful, smooth way. This gives the film a very relaxing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party that they all go for, which is also the Tournament Point for this movie. The beauty of this picture is not the question of how the characters have an effect on each other (in comparison with a similar, of course, better film like Magnolia). I simply don't think it was the bartender's idea. The beauty lies in the various details of experiences that people go through that create or break their lives. Barman is very successful in telling the little stories that describe small experiences. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The movie's soundtrack is also excellent but not a surprise as we know that the barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes warm and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the sunny, smooth feeling of the movie. Other times we hear funky pop / rock tunes that give some scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one error and that is the last half hour. Was it the runtime that struck me up? Or were not the last scenes that were fresh and precise than the scenes until then? I can't figure it out ... All in all, a beautiful sunny movie that lifts up the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> (It's the breeze flowing through a girl's hair on a sunshine afternoon that makes her even more beautiful, it's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you on a crowded party when someone opens the door, it is the breeze that carries perfume from the beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park that you just met a week ago, that's the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
