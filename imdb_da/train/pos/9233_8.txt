Flavia (Florinda Bolkan of "Do not Torture a Duckling" fame) is locked away in a paternal wife. Tired of all the sadism she sees around her (rape of a young woman in pork, sexual urge, horse castration) Flavia decides to run from the monastery with her Jewish friend from outside, Abraham. The two do not get very far until they are trapped and then brought back to be tortured and forced to repent. After the punishment she goes along with a Muslim band called the Tarantula, who had previously invaded the monastery and led a crusade that did not become a bloody battle behind the monastery walls. "Flavia the Heretic" is an orderly and rather infamous piece of Italian nunsploitation. The movie is a bit cruel and bad at times. The play is amazing and the characters are well developed. Overall, "flavia the heretic" is a truly moving and intelligent movie with lots of nudity and fun. You can't go wrong with that.8 out of 10.
