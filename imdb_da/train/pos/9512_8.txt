This is a movie that can make you see it again. I especially liked the way it ended. I did not see the end, but when the laws were not blown away the first time, he suspects that he will be back again. The story is poignant and could have been more psychological, but I understand history that was needed to capture the viewer, and the action was necessary for it. <br /> <br /> It was hard to believe that Michael Jr. could be as obviously untouched as his younger brother and mother blown away. But I can appreciate that the stage play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a bigger story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I think that is not justified. If his character had become more difficult, he would not care if his son pulled a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
