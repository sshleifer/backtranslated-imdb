"Casomai" is a masterful narrative depicting the story of a young couple giving way through the murky waters of marriage. The story is very credible by telling the weird saw between oblivion and mutual interference by others, which is quite typical in Italy (one might wonder if such events are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and this is one of the strong points in the film. Cases of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo are sober and poignant. And the sympathetic priest's figure is fun and rounded. All in all, a truly deserved movie, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
