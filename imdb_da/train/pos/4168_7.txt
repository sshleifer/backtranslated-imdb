Not only does this movie have one of the great movie titles, it sports the third group of 70s children's actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember that this movie was broadcast Halloween week back in 1978 against Linda Blair in Stranger in our house. I missed it initially and chose to watch the other movie. Later, by repetition, I saw that I had the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but really lacks chills or surprises. Although I looked like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog ​​to no avail.
