As far as I know, the real guy who plays the main actor saw his performance and said it was an excellent portrayal, I would agree with him. This is a great movie about a very gifted boy / man with a special body part that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA win, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Browna's curly man with cerebral palsy, who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. However, he has a special left foot, but he can write with it, paint it and keep things with it. He learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him. Also starts Home Alone 2's Oscar winner, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA wins Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. It was nominated Oscars for Best Director of Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on material from another medium and best picture, it was nominated BAFTAs for Best Movie, Best Make Up Artist and Best Custom Manuscript. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on the 100 biggest movie stars, he was number 20 on the 50 largest British actors, he was number 9 on Britain's finest actors, and he was number 15 on the world's largest actor, and the film was number 28 on the 50 largest British films. Excellent!
