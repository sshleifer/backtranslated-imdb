In general, I like something light and fun, so this movie should not have appealed to me. But it caught me from the start. The story of a family's choice and challenges seems obvious, but it raises the question again and again: "What if it was my family, my choice?" I cried and laughed as they did, because I really felt what the people felt. It was difficult to see in places, but harder to turn away. The story is true, and life is sometimes hard to see! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story all in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. Just like real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do the things they do!
