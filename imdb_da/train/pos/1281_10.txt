This movie is as good as it is hard to find. The film's hero (and author and director) is Simon Geist - a man "with an agenda." He creates a false leaf just to get the authority to interview the pigs in the Los Angeles - the actors, the models, the musicians - who think their own stools do not smell. With wise dialogue, Zucovic manages to do this. Sure, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Anyone who can restore Edward Munk's 'The Scream' in the reflection of a silver basket at a local coffee house should be nominated for some kind of price. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they've made the same car since 1986 ... it's called "car." Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
