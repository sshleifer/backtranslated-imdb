Fox's epic tale of America's greatest groundbreaking action comes to DVD with some truly outstanding "Extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" was added to the European release) and told the story the great pioneer leader who, in inspiration, brought members of the Mormon faith (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after mobs murdered them Prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was entering the Second World War. It was a bold move on the Fox boss, Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a fresh breath to the Mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to positively show their faith on the screen. Now, Fox, collaborating with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this movie to the DVD format in an outstading edition. Mr. D'Arc, a few years ago doing his doctorate on the film, has given one of the most in-depth commentary ever made for a DVD. He separates the facts from fiction and lets the hearers understand why these films were so much appreciated by Church leaders, even though decorations for the truth run through the film. One of the fun pieces of information is Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film, he was married to a last holy woman and eventually converted to LDS faith. There's a lot to learn from D'Arc's knowledge, and it's great to have this as part of the DVD! There are over 100 photos from the Fox & BYU archives included on the disk, plus news movies of the incredible seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another excellent DVD - and thank you James D'Arc for your great comment!
