This is a great movie, both for the incredible energy generated by the frenetic flamenco dance, and from the unique way the filmmakers blend the story of stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it. Spell binding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not 'Bizet's Carmen' by any standard. This is not a standard movie of any standard. Every nuanced look, every stump of the foot, every piece of music intertwined so captivating that you can't see your eyes out of the screen. You don't have to love opera or flamenco (I don't) to get caught, enchanted, thrilled by this movie. Subtle and direct; loud and quiet; One of, if not the best, movies of that kind, because there are so few.
