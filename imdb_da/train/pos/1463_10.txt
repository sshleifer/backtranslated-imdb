Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the making and throwing of pearls. I watched this movie at the Boston International Film Festival and expect a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was an accurate visual display of shocking footage from both China and the United States. The eye-opening movie is humorous, in-depth, serious, non-patronizing, and it leaves you wanting more like credit. It is worth comparing with Murderball - it is simply so well done. The young women in China have different views, and the owner is incredibly open to the discipline. The breeders under the Carnival are the highlight, but only because this excellent film provides in-depth coherence within the factory in China without any narrative. Bravo to the movie maker to come in and finish the movie! I would never have thought of the connection between pearls, China and New Orleans; now I am thinking of the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling a guilt after seeing this movie, unlike other movies on globalization that I have seen.
