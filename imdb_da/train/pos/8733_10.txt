When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters, I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew it was a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life as Toy Story is great story, great characters and good animation. My favorite characters are the Dim rhino Beetle spoken by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar spoken by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when the Slim Walking Pin (David Hyde Pierce) promises Hemlich to try to distract the Bird and Hemlichs as you Mr. Mr. Early Bird. What about a good tasting worm on a stick and Slim is like I'm gonna snatch! I'm gonna snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know many people consider it the worst Pixar movie ever! I don't know how to hate a Pixar movie! I think they are all really good movies! Good work PIXAR!
