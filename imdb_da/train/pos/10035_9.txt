I think James Cameron might be my favorite instructor because it's my second review of his movie. Anyway, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "invisible" ... until April 1912. It was the whole news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it, but star two fictional characters to be in the limelight instead of the ship. Well on the main assessment, but let me remind you that this is whole meaning and null fact, and the only thing that will be present is an event from the movie. So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not annoying too much, but see it here and you will find out why they could be annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The greatest villain I think is unfortunate, fate, the hand of God (no presumption is certain), or just Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get? Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are as follows: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many more. We also have today's treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is fantastic, especially in the second half, the drama as well. In the end, you can make your eyes lose rainstorm or quiet tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the heart of the sea and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her story on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few mistakes. I give Titanic a 86% awesome
