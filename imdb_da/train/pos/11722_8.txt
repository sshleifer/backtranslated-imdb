To be honest, I only watched this movie because of my pubic needs. I mean, I couldn't get women of my age (I was 9 or 10), so I thought to see Elvira's cleavage was closet stuff for sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a good time with this cool classic about horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor and some sexy evil exhibited by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just don't make movies like this anymore ... It had the feel of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show being style. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it generated lots of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is classic that reminds me of the good days in the US Up All Night.
