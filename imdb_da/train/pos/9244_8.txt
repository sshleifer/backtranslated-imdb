If you only read a synopsis of the plot, this movie would sound like a typical one of the 1930s. The story seems to be quite upset, the subject of maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film is in the cast's direct, earthly notions. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow display such a series of emotions, rich and subtle shades flowing over her face. If you see their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, then there is a distinct feeling between the protagonists. The raw feelings are so sincerely portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise with his son, lifts him up and proudly says, "My kid!" Couldn't I remember Mr. Gables own son was born to him posthumously. This is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema.
