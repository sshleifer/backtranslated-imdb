Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is in favor of taking a position as secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her girlfriend who leaves her. Almost immediately she is killed and sent to the family property in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they still tell her that she is Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keeps her locked ... but why? You will probably guess why, but will not mind because this is fun. <br /> <br /> Along with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face behind the Mask", this is one of the best B-pictures ever made. (B images were low budget images made quickly with low budgets and no big stars). It is as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is orderly, fast and exciting. It only stumbled at the end, which I found a little too unreliable to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is just OK, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary) like the bad guys. Worth catching. A perfect example of how to make a good movie on a small budget.
