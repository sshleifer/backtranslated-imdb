In the old west there are always the men who live and breathe and the women who hold their breath. A famous ¨town tamer¨ called Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is hired by the citizens to free gunslingers (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), Baronlands hoodlums. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the Saloon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint as a lawyer is appointed deputy to bring peace and set some cartels that say: ¨ Warning, the use of weapons or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check all hardware at the Marshal's Office. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend, a local madame (Jan Sterling) in charge of the Saloon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council fears the raw methods performed by Clint. At the end, the royal earthman appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly exciting story of a sheriff for recruiting who had only one killed to go. It starts out as a slow western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot. The story is almost mischievous, a pacifier comes to a city just in time to secure his citizenship, but later the events are getting worse. The highlights are at Saloon and the climatic showdown at the end. Phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as an avenging angel and bitter gunfighter, he is the whole show. Live and lively musical score by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Black and White Atmospheric Filmography by Lee Garmes. The movie is surprisingly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in Attic), who made good Western as an invitation to a gunfighter and Zane Gray episodes. Watchable results for this offbeat Western.
