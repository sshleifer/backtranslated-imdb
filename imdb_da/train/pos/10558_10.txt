<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made strange metaphysical anxiety popular, but this Canadian gem makes it fun. <br /> <br /> Like most weird movies, the less said about the plot the better, but let's put the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they can't cope with the world and eventually mean what they no longer need. But this is where even more problems begin. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile long after the final credits, and it's a rare experience with so many mass-produced pieces of "nothing" out there. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one. <br /> <br />
