Much like the comedy duo of the title "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic 30-odd years later. It is hardly mentioned along with other great movie comedies from the 1970s. This makes no sense considering the unique specialty of this movie, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, half a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who can't get a job in a potato chip commercial. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is confident he can get a job if Willy will only agree to reunite with his alien partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for an ABC television show with show business nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what the "Sunshine Boys" spade right from the start, as a series of 1920s movie clips showcase various entertainers from long ago flickering us to the accompaniment of Cole Porter's "Be A Clown". Then there is the film's contemporary setting in Manhattan, where flared pants and wide polyester ribbons are teeming. The periods collide in Willy's brilliant clutter on a Manhattan apartment, where framed photos and comics of long-standing celebrities stand out from the walls of lurid tabloid headers and empty Zabar shopping bags. If you lived in the 1970s like me, you could even feel like you were on that occasion. <br /> <br /> Willy has apparently lived there for too long. He sleeps in front of the television when the boiler in the other room boils. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hey, who's this?" A break. "Forget it, it's teen." <br /> <br /> Old men living alone can be sad material in almost everyone else's hands, but Simon's deep joke and effortless sense of character make this adaptation of his 1972 scene to comedy gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs your nose in Willy's almost existential state without turning you off at all. "89 years old and just how he dies of nothing" "Willy says about an old songwriter friend before deciding on the man, probably died from writing a song that rhymed" lady "with" baby ". <br /> <br / Burns won an Oscar for his undervalued performance as the gentle, but Steely Lewis, but it is Matthau who brings this home, his makeup and proud, but ragged Bearing really sells you on the idea that he was already 73 when he did this Willy is unpleasant in the extreme, fully deserving Ben's description "Crazy Freakin 'Old Man", but you mess with him and enjoy his little victories even when they come at the expense of the patience of others. he tries to kill Lewis for whom the TV reunion turns out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You're out of touch!" Willy tells Lewis at some point. "I'm still in demand. I'm still warm! "<br /> <br />" If this room was on fire, you wouldn't be hot, "replies Lewis. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross shoots everything in a very relaxed and discreet way with low light and space shots even in emotional moments to make room for the comedy and film's overall zen message of grace through silent acceptance. You never get the feeling that you are watching a movie, one of "The Sunshine Boys" many charms, and Ros's direction, as the three main characters play, goes a long way towards reaching the end. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when the subjects are people who see life, pass them by, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes it all a pleasure because it is for us to see.
