Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaptation yet. Not surprisingly, when King himself wrote the manuscript. The story follows the Creed family, moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a nice old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs straight through their backyard. The other is a path leading to Pet Sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals that were killed by the highway. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis (the father), is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial ground, beyond Pet Sematary, where the church should be buried. Later, Louis is greeted (not so politely) by the Church. He has come back and seems to have chewed himself out of the bag he was buried in. Perhaps he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more can I say without destroying the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the royal adjustments I've seen this would be the most frightening. The signs are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a good job. The suspension is kept quite high throughout the film, which is partly due to the basic development. The scene where Gage is killed will hold onto your mind forever. Then of course we have the conclusion. Easy to decide what will happen, but Lambert pulls some really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. All in all, this is a good movie and an excellent fit. If you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images, then "Pet Sematary" is what you're looking for. Non Horror fans would like to avoid this.
