Recently shown on cable TV, the movie opens with a disclaimer that goes away from any collaboration between real people; it is in itself an eye-catcher. But the script and the play from the protagonists is amazing, and I found myself confused everywhere. In no way go to the sharp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is about a meeting of one day between two real musical "legends" that previously composed together then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that explains their original "divisions". What is so impressive is that the actors provide such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play, mistakes, and all that this viewer was at least left to believe I was witnessing a true event in almost every detail. The great skill of this game is that with sharp writing and fine acting a movie basically about "two of us" speaking can make an excellent picture. Worth at least an 8 out of 10.
