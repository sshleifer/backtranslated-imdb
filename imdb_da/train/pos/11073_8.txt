I have never known a movie to awaken such debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie is eventually remembered as a full-time classic. I waited in anticipation of this movie, which I had previously loved both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some of the negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely loved this movie and I can't wait to see it again. This film is quite different from both of the aforementioned Ritchie films, and also much better. I have my favorite director selections, but none of them have taken a step as well as Guy Ritchie has just done with this movie. I think he has taken film production to another level (I know most people will laugh at this comment that controls the reaction to this movie, but I think time will tell me right). This movie is very confusing and continued for much longer than 2 hours of running time, as I couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together. I have now got a good grip on everything that happens in this movie (some answers from endless hours of thinking, some answers from reading others' footage) and now I can't wait until Sunday when I see again. I just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind, and hopefully they will be rewarded as I and many others have been.
