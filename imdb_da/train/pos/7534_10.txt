I totally disagree with the other reviews. All in all, negative. I took a chance on this movie and was glad I did. Glad indeed.I couldn't find anything wrong with it. No time. The script is original. The actors are all sympathetic and convincing. The Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady of Brady Bunch. But this gal can really act. The setting in the Australian Outback is perfect. Unknown scenery. Fantastic soundtrack, ie Paul Kelly. Good bless Paul Kelly. Cranberries are also here. I've watched this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably see it again. It is interesting. It does a thinking. It is (was) probably better than nine tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters it was also out during this time. Afterwards, a likable.Well photographed film. I couldn't find anything wrong with that. Check it out! My first review!
