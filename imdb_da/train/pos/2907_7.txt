The view is a fantastic movie that explores the tensions in family life in the idyllic setting of Galiano Island off the British Columbia coast. Lotus Eaters_ is appalled by the fact that it is packaged as a movie for television, constantly diminishing by adding chirpy music over potentially powerful scenes, as if getting ready for the interruption of advertising. A shame, really.
