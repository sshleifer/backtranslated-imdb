Riding Giants is a great movie. It really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. Their lives were mostly surfing, living, breathing and fun. They didn't care about money, jobs, girls or anything. For them, the waves were their girls. I have never been on a surfboard and it looks so hard, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. This is a great movie and if you love surfing then you really should watch this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came into life, who is really famous for it or anything, then you really need to see it. It can be a documentary, but it is really good. -Tara F.-
