I've always had movies that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy end. "A river runs through it" is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Live ebbs and flow like a river, and it has rough spots, but it's a wonderful trip. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His story has a friendly atmosphere that fits perfectly with the picture. As an instructor he is maintained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the play, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I do not quite know how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they really feel right. "A river runs through it" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
