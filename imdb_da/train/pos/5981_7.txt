TRICK OR TREAT is a great example of Hollywood jumping on the bandwagon "Backwards Messages in Metal Music", which Tipper Gore and her Washington Wives started in the mid 80s (other less successful entries in this mini-genre include the horrible BLACK ROSES and stupid THE GATE). I was a sophomore in high school when TRICK OR TRÃ†D came out and couldn't wait to see it. It seemed to disappear from video stores in the late 80's, but I finally made up for an affordable DVD copy recently, and it brought back many cozy metal memories from the day. Any teen metal nerd can relate to Eddie Ragman Weinbauer (Marc Price of Family Stories) in this movie, when he is pursued by the preppie "beautiful" people in his high school for his heavy metal fashion and musical taste. Eddie's favorite star is Sammi Curr (similar to Tommy Lee of Motley Crue) who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie. Eddie is unthinkable until he receives a test test of Sammy's final, unpublished album from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a short como). Eddie soon discovers that this LP, when played backwards, allows him to communicate with Sammi Curr's undead spirit! Soon, Sammi Eddie gives advice on how to get the same with his preppie torturers, but when the messages escalate in sharpness ("Waste'em ALL ... no false metal!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, resulting in Sammi Comes back to life through Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi races to the big dance at Eddie's high school and takes the stage to rock the audience and break down a few unfortunate "false metalworkers" before Eddie arrives to save the day and the girl in her dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not terribly scary in 2006, it wasn't even scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metals and have a kick-ass soundtrack compassion by cult band Fastway. Worth finding out if you've ever smashed your head or taste on B-grade horror movies (or both, like me).
