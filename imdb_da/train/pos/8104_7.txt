This is a fantastic movie from 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish view of the year 2036 that comes after the words is clear. But the plan doesn't understand the whole dialogue - the sound quality and the accents (it's American - but the "1930s") make it difficult. <br /> <br /> Basically, history is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictitious American city called "Everytown". It dates from 1936 when a war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology leaps and creates its own problems. The first one hour is a bit slow - although it's hard to tell what audiences would have believed. The events, the excitement and the pictures are pretty little in today's expression. But when it comes to the future, it's just fun to see. The big sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have good listening skills, this movie is hard to listen to. I think I understood only 80% of the dialogue. It can use closed caption. <br /> <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, this is one of the classics of the genre, and it's a must (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until there is a closed image version and then see it if you are familiar with movies from that time period.
