Recap: It's business as usual at Louche's casino in Tangier. The casino is closing and preparing for a big transaction the next day. The owner Louche and some staff leave the night and leave modesty. Suddenly, a troop of the armed gangster stormed the casino and shot wildly. Unknown to Modesty, they have already killed Louche, and are now after the money stored in the vault. But no one present and still alive at the casino knows the code to open the vault. The vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives, so the attackers cannot blow the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty finds himself in the eye with the walkers' leader Miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in danger. Comments: This is a review written without connection what ever with other published media about Modesty Blaise, which I have not seen or read any of it. The first point I like to make is that this is a little erroneously classified. First of all, I thought it was a thriller with a fight of wits between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Sure there are some actions, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. As already mentioned, the main plot and main thrill scene is the game between Modesty and Miklos. It is an innovative and exciting way to reveal the background of a sign, and in so much of history goes beyond the casino at a much earlier time. Someone said it is almost like a pilot for a television series, and the feeling is that it can actually be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many others have done. I was in no way disappointed with the lack of action, instead of enjoying this game, the story much more than a simple action movie. I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. The city in particular depicts Modesty very well and really has this confidence and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
