I didn't give this movie a perfect score to be honest in comparison to great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai." However, this movie is so wonderful, it's a shame it scores so badly for the general IMDb voter. The Imdb voter, however, links to the geeky, and "Paulie" does not qualify for it. <br /> <br /> The only action critic I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect pedigree. I'm sorry, but ask a 6 year old child to expel Dustin Hoffman when Rainman asks for the impossible in film production. <br /> <br /> Moving past this minor complaint, the movie has the best of many movies: buddy road trip, con-games, quite like friendly celebrations (feasting), Disney-like humor for young and old, etc. What can you don't like? Tony Shaloub carries his role as a pair of comfortable jeans. It is normal for him, it seems. ("I'm Russian ... I like long stories.) I don't like mangoes, but he does almost me, I want to go out and buy one. Watch the movie and it will make sense. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances in the movie Roles that fit well with what we all know about them, I have always found Jay Mohr to be a bit slimy and his role on the screen fits so well. Surprise for me was to find out that Jay was also Paulie's voice, and finally it works well, put Parrot and Anti-Parrot together as a team, creating a magic of its own. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to find a movie for you and the kids who are neither abusive nor boring for either, "Paulie" is a perfect candidate, but I will admit that a good moment will color my review of "Paulie". road under a large heat wave. The car's air conditioning died, half of the restaurants had dead cooling (like our hotel) and I said, "leave we see a movie where there is working climate itioning. "So we did. So for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused and given a heart warming experience. When I saw it recently on the VCR under less emotional circumstances, I realized how well this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It's a sleeping movie you won't regret watching.
