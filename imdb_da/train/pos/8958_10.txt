When you see Vertigo, see Bell, Book and Candle, made within a few months of each other. <br /> <br /> My second favorite Kim Novak movie, with Picnic, comes in third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo is the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to my nowhere Kansas Prairie town, near, in Salina, Kansas in the 50s, to movies, Picnic. <br /> <br /> I think the musical score of Bell, Book and Candle is one of Alex Nord's. Perfect for this bit of comedy. After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, this comedy made how entertaining to note the dramatic contrast. Worth your time if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
