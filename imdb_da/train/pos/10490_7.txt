Yet another example of what a British cinema can achieve: a simple story, told and acted well. Brenda Blethyn provides a layered and warming performance like the newly widowed and economical straitened Grace, heavily assisted by a solid support cast. The card "quirky small town" is played for hilt, as are many TV shows and movies that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). As the aforementioned, this film uses some beautiful rural surroundings, in this case the wet and wild Cornish coast. Some viewers may find the wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging, others may find it just ends a little too sweet and safe. But it's an enjoyable spliff, to be sure.
