What a perfect example of "Less is more ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! As a black-and-white image, when your eye fills the subjects, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture all combine to have a stronger effect. This is one of the top 5 movies I can't live without right there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked this, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" both starring Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who were also soldiers. The "Thirteenth Warrior" with Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" with Harrison Ford.
