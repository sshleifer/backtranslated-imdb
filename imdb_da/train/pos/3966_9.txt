JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working with the agency before being called the FBI, and the story involves handling the Ku Klux Klan, the Prohibition Times, the Second World War, German and Japanese Spies, etc. A continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history better than any movie being made these days. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest to older viewers familiar with Washington, DC. In a scene about 20 minutes in the movie --- where James Stewart finds out about Vera Miles that she expects their first child --- the movie was recorded in Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on the former Washington waterfront, the only movie where this historic location is displayed. Shortly after taking a position, President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was an eye and should be broken down. By decree for his position on undisputed royalties, the entire area including the popular waterfront restaurant area but exclusive 3 historic churches; was reduced to ruins. Black residents exposed from their homes moved as best they could and without federal help; Also, businesses were simply put out of service, getting re-located. Restaurant Row was transformed into a sidewalk, and Washington had no waterfront (restaurants, seafood stands, boats, etc.) for approx. Ten years. As a lifetime resident, Herzog Restaurant scene was our # 1 reason to watch this fine movie again.
