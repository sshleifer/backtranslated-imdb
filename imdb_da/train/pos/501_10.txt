I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series yet, I say Potentially. We all know that there is a chance that they will lose the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT I hope not! For those who haven't seen it .. SEE IT! Without the annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" floating over their heads every time they run, it can be cool .. and Scott Bakula was undoubtedly a great choice for captain, and Vulcan Babe is also hot (Check out the decontamination scene) I gave this a FULL 10 ... it blows away all the other series openers .. I hope it goes beyond 7 years ...
