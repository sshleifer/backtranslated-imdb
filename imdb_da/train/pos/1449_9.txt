This is one of the best crime-drama films in the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a strong story, and many of the players involved gave good performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good as long as the viewer didn't mind his Louuu-siana accent. He can come out as annoying if you can't stand this dialect. The way that Pacino's character interacts with Cusack's character was credible, dramatic, and somewhat comical at times. Danny Aiello was fantastic as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take another view to remember, "which Zapatti was which?" After so many cross-references, stop and think just to recycle. The finish did not have much stitch. It was built up for so long and so was a bit of a downturn. This was one of the few problems with the movie. When the movie was not billed as a "big, blockbuster" big screen, it made some forget that this movie itself existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the film's lack of "splash" in the theaters may have counted on no nominations. It was semi-successful on the domestic market, and viewers still learn that this title is out there. Created in 1996, it still stands today and will remain popular for many years to come. <br /> <br /> Then you make some lemon pudding (you can see) and watch this movie!
