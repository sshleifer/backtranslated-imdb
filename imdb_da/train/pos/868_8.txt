What is very French about this movie is the time it takes to establish the two leading characters. This may require some patience, especially since neither is "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition of such. But when "heist" kicks in, the movie hurries forward quickly, perhaps at times too fast. But it is a real roller coaster ride, and if you do not look too close, it is completely credible. The kind of movie you know about Hollywood would have turned up.
