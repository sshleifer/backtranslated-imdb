Brutal, numb Michael Myers sticks his sister to death for six years on the Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and introduces a new terrorist government into his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is constantly being persecuted by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how bad this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens with a slap and creates a truly exciting and atmospheric cooler that is actually superior to the many slasher images it helped inspire. It is subtle in relation to the ugly carnations many of the subsequent films were; subtle and scary. It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated prospects. How many movies are there, really that can continue to be scary even after you have seen them before? Not as many. Pleasence is amazing in what was probably his final career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her film debut, has become a bona fide screaming queen after performing in "Halloween" as well as a few subsequent slasher images, and she is a particular victim worth rooting for. <br /> <br /> Co-author / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; Notice how most of the movie is set after the evening. With this image, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that has created seven successors, many imitators and a forthcoming "remake". It's very quote - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis' (Pleasence) speech, describing Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire player in several of Carpenter's earlier works)? It is fantastic and worth seeking out. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not quite unlikely - after all, there are script holes - but generally it has a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
