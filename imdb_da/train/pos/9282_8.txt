In Iran, women are not admitted to football matches. Officially, it is because they have to be saved from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are lower forms of people. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. They are trapped by soldiers and hold a kind of cage until the police come and collect them. <br /> <br /> Despite the crazy situation, this is a movie with lots of humor. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. You will be touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. Good work by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
