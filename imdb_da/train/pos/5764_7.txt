I originally reviewed this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and blasted it. I think I called it "miserable" and a "turkey." Okay, that's most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no production value, which little plot is almost no sense, and the play is on par with a third game. That said, this has really grown on me over the years as a kind of classic camp. In fact, all director Todd Sheets' films have had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood in that respect: See them over and over again and choose the merged lines, continuity errors (same zombie, two different places!) And other errors. Say this: Sheets are a very nice guy, and while this, one of his first productions, is not that big, he has got better. And I have to add that the only really decent actor / actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, though I can be prejudiced when I went to school with her.
