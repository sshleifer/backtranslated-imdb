The kids aged 7 to 14 got such a big kick out of this movie that we gave a copy to all the other kids on our birthday list this year. They all loved it! Children from 2 to 7 see it repeatedly and often, and we get a kick out of seeing it with them. It is rare that a movie entertains the children for so long and offers laughs to the adults, too. Most enjoy it more than the first. Top quality production and an excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George - athletic, energetic and completely credible with a lovable innocence and a particularly wise to take a tree on the face - well supported by the endless Christina Pickles as the evil sister-in-law, Thomas Haden Church like the evil rival rival, and everyone else. This is fun.
