I was quite young when it came out in the US, but I recorded it from television and watched it again and again until I had it all hidden. To this day I get myself quoting it. The show was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. The voices were large and sounded like the characters they portrayed. The puppets were also well finished, although it was a little scary. I was surprised to find out that it was recently written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor from Red Dwarf, a show that I also greatly enjoy. As another person wrote in a comment earlier, I was also robbed of this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I would certainly wish there was enough demand for this show to justify a DVD release, but I don't think enough people have heard about it. Oh yes, I might try e-bay ...
