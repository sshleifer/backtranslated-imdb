I do not understand. Not to be a critic, I do not consider the quality of the action that I find credible, a good thing. My confusion lies in the content. No one else is sensitive to the fact that these two incredible women justified their adultery with men who fought and softened to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their country. Wouldn't there have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home, and if so, what effect did they have on their fraud "wives"? While these women were bedding their paramours out of a feeling of loneliness, did they think their husbands enjoyed being shot on while facing death or dismemberment daily? They didn't even think of their husbands! Only by itself. Excuse me, except when they wanted their men dead.
