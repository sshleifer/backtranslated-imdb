I got hooked on this as apparently ABC has licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was surprised as it was a break from listening to some Chinese. But I started getting reeled in as cast and story lines are just NYC enough and thoughtful. Nothing too incredible, although I think it is very very stereotypical to write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet !!!! It has been the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great, and I'm sorry to learn on IMDb that I can't look forward to seeing Season 2 when I return to the US. I am as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste. But just as the signs are getting closer, it's probably harder for people to see if the start begins to see more episodes in. It seems a little too late for the eager networks.
