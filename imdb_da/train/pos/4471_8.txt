Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi star in "Anchors Aweigh," directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two navy guys on leave in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and take him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They are trying to help but there is a mix-up. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical music with great dance and song by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly will dance with Jerry Mouse in a nice order. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. Sinatra has to show its versatility and why the girls swelled over him with the big blue eyes and boyish face. For Kelly, this was a big break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Great movie, very fluid.
