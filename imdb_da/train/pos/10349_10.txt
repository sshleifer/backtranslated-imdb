This is one of the films that made me aware of the need to make movies at all. Generally, I'm a fan of movies based on worthy true stories. And this one is great! In addition to Meryl's performance, which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the film's greatest asset is the story it is based on. The key narrative of a couple suffering from social and legal torture after experiencing tremendous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their children is truly an eye-opening fable that exposes the inhuman side of fellow human beings and reveals the barbarism of a very refined and legal community. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves cozy and intelligent people (the emotional jury ladies in the film for example) are in fact no more than selfish dupes who, for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, close their minds to any consideration and contemplation even in the light of all facts points very clearly to their opinions. The other face in the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is apathy to the pain of fellow human beings (of course, this is very general, although this particular story unfolds in Australia), it goes as far as true cruelty. Must see if you are willing to take something serious and maybe thoughtful.
