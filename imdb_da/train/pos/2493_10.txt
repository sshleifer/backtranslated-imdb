Typical 90-comedy, situational comedy resembles our modern day "My Family". Thatcher is the height of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) accuses Thatcher of all she can. "Bloody Thatcher" may be shared with most of us. David the typical teenager, cut brains with bread knives, Jenny, the moody older teenage child, only interested in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben work as much as possible to keep their family rolling in the economic climate of the early 90s. Admittedly, the first two series were not as successful as the latter, but series 3 and forward is where it all kicks with several laughs, which I am happy to count. All in all, this show didn't get the best viewing time, and they should have lasted a little longer. It was clear that they could not continue after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of "catherine Tate" office "little Britain" and bring the classics back!
