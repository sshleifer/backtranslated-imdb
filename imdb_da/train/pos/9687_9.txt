A talking parrot is not a huge imaginative idea for a new movie, but Paulie becomes a simple idea for a brilliant, cordial movie that will delight the whole family. The gap between sentimental garbage and cruel hardness during Marie and Paulie's separation succeeded in overhauling, and all the events in the film lead to a very satisfying emotional conclusion. The animal training is well-trained - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have gotten much more success, although this movie was not a highlight in 1998, as opposed to saving Private Ryan. This and a half hour will surely be an enjoyable and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy, and interesting - from the moment he first sees the moment he is united with his original owner, you will enjoy following him and seeing him learn about friendship and the wicked realities of life along the way. Not one to miss if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9.10
