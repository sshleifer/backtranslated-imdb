I went into this movie, maybe a little confused by the hack-and-slash movies today on the screen. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly paced with a gloomy, dark atmosphere. More surprisingly, the very limited amount of blood was actually shown. As with most good films, this leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a great job of leading. Scenes shot into the car, which are well-finished, and having seen the episode "Anatomy of a scene" at the end of the videotape, it was good to see that some of the subtle, but wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just a "Oh, it looks good, hold it" kind of direction. This is a moody movie filled with grimness. But for the dark topic, a significant portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. The action is extraordinary (Okay, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth) and never go over the top. Au Contraire, it is very subdued, which works very well for this type of film. If there is an area where this movie is missing, it is at the end, which is just a little too constructed, but still works on a simpler level without damaging the mood or message of the movie. What is the message? It is something that each person decides for himself. Overall, this movie scores an 8 to 8 that likes the Southern Gothic genre (ie "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and about a 5 for those who don't.
