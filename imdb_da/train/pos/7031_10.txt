This is a great movie, I did the game some time ago. It had an extra zing - for that. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey and Jason Alexander also has a good voice. It was good. The setting was also very good. Except that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it does take quite a while. Overall I give it 8.5 stars. They also added a few parts, but it was still cool.
