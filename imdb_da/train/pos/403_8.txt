I remember that the trailer for the Legend of Zu was pretty impressive and was a fan of A Man Called Hero (my all time favorite), Storm Riders I decided to see this too. I know there is way too much criticism on Ekin Cheng's working ability everywhere, but he is my favorite Hong Kong moviestar so far (far better than Nicolas Tse anyway) and he is one of the factors I enjoyed this movie. Without a doubt, this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I thought only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated at the end of this movie. They must have put a lot of work into it and they deserve good credit for it. The film's story was an adventure between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I think Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but it is not what you expect when you are doing an action movie. I wished there were more martial arts actions with fists and fists instead of battles with magical abilities, but good it is life and it never goes as you want it. And why do they sound like supersonic planes in the fight through heaven in the end? It's too much fun. The legend of Zu cannot be a man called in my eyes, but it flows like a video game, and that's not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie, I won't be surprised because it bears all the video game elements. Good work. Please make several fantasy films like this one
