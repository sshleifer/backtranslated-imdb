I'm curious about what rifle Beckett used in the movie, and also the bullet's bullet, which he supposed to shoot. If this is solved based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I guess it's a 7mm. round. I'm also curious about the gun itself. He also made a comment in the final Sniper movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man used to use his father. Beckett said he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I want to know which rifle there is too. I know that this particular rifle was made around World War II or in advance. I just couldn't look close to it and watch the movie to identify it. <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Hathcock's killer was his longest shot 1.47 miles and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. After his wounds were completely healed from being burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career training snipers in the USMC the skills they would need in the field. His sniping career is still mentioned for our brothers and sisters who train in the USMC. I found out his name from my friend who is a former Marine. Any information would be great.
