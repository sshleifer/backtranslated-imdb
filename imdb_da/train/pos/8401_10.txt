Love trap is a "must see" independent film. When I sat down to watch the movie, I came in with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, content and creative. The author draws you further and further as each scene, so you can relate to the realistic characters that anyone can identify with. The film made it possible for me to reflect on my life and what I think love to be. The film showed what love really is, action not emotions. I was also impressed by the film quality and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
