Stories ?? whether written, visual or poetic epic ?? generally try to avoid too many signs; readers and viewers can easily be overwhelmed by trying to keep an eye on who exactly is who. This is especially true in movies I think simply because we can't easily get back to updating our memory in a movie theater. Viewers like myself do not have the problem because we see all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny by Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large number of characters. This previous offer exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity. Now other directors have used these techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with a Food, Food, Food, Mad World in 1963, a comedy with almost epic proportions. The difference with this movie is first that the director lets us look at some of the characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated as means to update the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods. /> The basic ?? the core, so to speak ?? The story relates to a young woman, Irene (Tautou), who is told by a colleague on the train that she will meet her true love on that day. This happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The wise irony at this time is that Irene is not aware that the young opposite (Gilbert Robin) can be the 'true love'. And neither ... <br/> <br /> They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. However, chaos during the rest of the day, not just for the two youngsters, but for the other characters that appear in a series of smartly constructed and interwoven vignettes, all seemingly not going anywhere, yet ... < br /> <br /> If history was simply so, it could be dull and even predictable. Not so. The script and the director are ripping into our expectations with a wealth of innovative scenes that are all too common but which turn into credible and extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time a bird cushion from the sky falls on a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; Two characters make an obvious choice to happen before Irene and her fate meet again. Or how about a stench chip flying on your windshield? Consider again what would happen ... All that is interesting enough. What was more interesting to me was to assess each new man who came together and tried to determine if this guy was one for Irene or whether it was actually the young man on the train. It kept me guessing for a while. <br /> <br /> I will let you think about it if you see this lovely body. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
