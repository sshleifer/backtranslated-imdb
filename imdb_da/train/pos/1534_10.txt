I love this show as it is action packed with adventure, love and intrigue. Well sometimes love! It is so good to see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect. It is also very good to see Dick Van Dyke in a television role that I have only seen him in Mary Poppins. The mix of the main characters Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve are very catchy to the audience. This is a show you should see!
