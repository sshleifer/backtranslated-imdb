Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show business, so many things were fake in this movie. First of all, decision makers argued that Elvis opened his famous live shows in '69 after a 9-year-old haul for film by wearing a white jumping suit produced in 1972. They also claimed he sang 'burning love', which he first sold in 1972 and "The Wonder of You", which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know every movie based on past has something fake, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
