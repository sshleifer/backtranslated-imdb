I just finished watching this finely crafted and beautifully acted / directed movie. It was nip and tuck about whether or not to waste my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the terribly distracting advertisements. Reading the previous comments persuaded me to give it a shot. After all the worst could happen, I could fall asleep during one of the boring yet long bug spray ads. So why did I see it? mainly because when IMDB gives a film a "WEIGHT REFLECTION" of 5.8, which STATISTICAL IMPLEMENTATION was 7.3. It must be a safe hit. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to have taken the time to watch this movie, commercial pox and everything. Helen Hunt continues to marvel at her ability to take hard roles to adapt his core persona to fit every role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this movie of the hard but perceptive human police officer was beautifully executed. When the scene calls for fast witted, timely verbal intercourse, she can stand toe to toe with any actor. Yet, she is capable of delivering volumes of emotional response without expressing a word that is only dependent on facial expressions and body language. Without the advertisements, which by design kills the continuity of any good movie, this would have been a real nail bite. I gave it a 9.0
