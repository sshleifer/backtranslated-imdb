Why doesn't Dynamo have any pants? Where did they go ?? It was never explained. Therefore, this movie was so amazing. Plus Starsky gave her children AIDS! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserved to win Best Supporting Actor! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was "It hit the spot" A IN D S. This movie was for "the birds". I tried to give this movie "stinkeye" but it continued to play. What am I doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was fun, lol;) I'd like it for a show. Why was Dynamo wearing pants. I know his arm was crooked but ... What about those crazy futures. Why didn't the family celebration guy Ray Combs get a net ?? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
