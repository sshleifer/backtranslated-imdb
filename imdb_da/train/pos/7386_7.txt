Okay, so the Oscar seems to be hyped just a little more every year. And I rowed for "Gosford Park" to win (come on, Robert Altman had earned an Oscar for years!). That said, I assume it was time for an African American to win the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, Halle Berry's role in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than Nicole Kidmans in the "Moulin Rouge"; I would never have thought to nominate the latter for anything, especially in a year that saw "Mulholland Dr.". <br /> <br /> Among the things I had predicted were about the September 11 attacks; I knew they should say something about freedom. Yes Yes. Robert Redford should know better. But unlike the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the former hosts, Bob Hope was for whom I have no respect); I really liked her jab at John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So even though I wouldn't have given "The Beautiful Mind" Best Picture, "The 74th Annual Academy Awards" still satisfied with me (I have to admit I enjoy Oscar's more than my own birthday). And the next day, when my parents and I walked around the homes in New Mexico, it was a break - I was thinking of myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people looked and asked, "Jim who?" wonder if Woody Allen will ever join the Oscar again.
