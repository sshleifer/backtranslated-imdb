Dana Andrews is one of the actors I have probably seen in a dozen movies, but who has never really registered me. Often stolen, implied, playing the same kind of roles and looks a bit like the correspondingly undervalued Glenn Ford, he is an actor making an effort to really appreciate; But when you hit the right movie .... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's mood on New York's underbelly is as dirty and seedy as almost any 50's noir, and Andrews is in his element as far too hard policeman Mark Dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game to move on: he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. Early in the film, he kills a witness of a murder involving an illegal crap game created by a mobster whom Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he uses the rest of the film to try to cover his engagement and bring mobster to him kind of "justice". Along the way, he becomes involved with the alienated wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney), and also tries to get her father from hook to murder. <br /> <br /> Fantastically photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with hard and sparkling dialogue by Ben Hecht and a really powerful ending with tragedy elements and found grace in just a minute or twice, it is another noir for the time and can be my favorite Preminger movie so far - it's just as good as the more heralded Laura.
