I just started to watch the TV series "What I Like About You" and I have to say it is a joy to see. I always want to see new shows do well considering that many shows go off before you really get a feel for them. I have seen Amanda Bynes since "All That" she is really a fun girl, what is best about her comedy is that it is so natural and what I think about it is something a person can do here, how best friend says its not repeated. <br /> <br /> I recently started to watch the show and have fallen in love. I'm just looking again over now, but I'm looking forward to next season. All the characters in the show give something to the whole story. It's great to see some old face from other shows I've enjoyed watching in the past, such as Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys." The new character is also very talented, and Nick Zano has the charm that makes you love him even when doing something wrong for holly (Bynes). All in all, this has shown the right ingredients to be successful, I look forward to seeing it grow.
