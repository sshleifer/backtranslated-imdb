In the same tone as his Americana Drums along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictional yet highly credible. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films in this era with Ford, and all three are about a certain time and place with an emphasis on surroundings and cultural surroundings. In Mohawk, pioneer America is in full bloom with Americans defending themselves against Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us the United States from the 19th century; a time when the invention and creativity began to flourish, and this nation became truly great. All of it was a long, lukewarm young lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln, and this film fictions his life as a lawyer and sheds the magnitude he would later perform. <br /> <br /> Fonda is great in this movie, capturing the essence of what is considered to be Lincoln's persona, though no one knows exactly what he was like then. The seats and the support supports also work well together and give a unique balance in Ford's picturesque of the American dream and its many forms. This is not a movie to be taken literally, but rather symbolically, and shows that Lincoln really warms up the events of his life that should create his legacy. We even get some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd; And it's hard to see how they end up, but it's not the intention. I think it's simply a tribute to Lincoln's grandeur, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His quiet and righteous behavior was rare then and would be today. In fact, our government certainly needs more men like him.
