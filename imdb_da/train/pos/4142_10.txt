FATTY DRIVES BUS is simply the funniest, most original and entertaining piece of work I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means up to Hollywood standards, or even that of a straight-to-video movie fluff comedy featuring the terry "hulk" hogan in terms of camera work, editing, play, budget or anything else. <br /> <br /> What this movie does, but is a very original and enjoyable story, and of course, is done by people who love doing it and the enthusiasm of all the cast and the crew really breaks through their budget and trades fall. <br /> <br /> This movie proves you're not 'You don't need a big budget or decent actors to make a good movie. All you need is some original ideas and a little passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> Just the best movie ever. I don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, then watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope they make a DVD version.
