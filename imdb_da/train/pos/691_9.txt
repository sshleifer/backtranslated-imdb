I come clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the movie's title, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not in such a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there on this brief, I was actually thrilled to see it. I sent to my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, an insomniac, often afflicted by conditions that make him doubt what is reality and what's in the head. I will not give away what is happening, but I will tell you that the movie can sometimes be scary in it's realism. The management is great, focusing on what is crucial to history without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtful moments. All in all, I give this amazing movie 9 out of 10, to go far beyond what I thought any card could achieve.
