This one is a fantastic one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have created together to create a strong and very influential film. This is the true story of the first black American Navy dolls and the obstacles he faces by reaching his certification in the hands of a racist Master Diver. Along the way, he must also meet ordinary old bigotry from all his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. In the end, he gets certified and continues to have a good US Navy career. See it here! It is a great tale of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we will see racism disappear slowly, and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.
