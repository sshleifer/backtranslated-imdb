They jawing journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from "His Girl Friday" or the witty detective William Powell and sassy lady Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur muscles in Scoop. Their scrub repair is more postmodern than post-depression, Allen's writing-filled with ironic self-deprecation and plain old New York anxiety. Shadows of the old wit rarely occur, as when he, like Sid, The Great Splendini Magician, responds to his background: "I was born in the Hebrew persuasion, but as I grew older, I converted to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a poor girl, here becomes a relatively good, sometimes ditsy, journalist student caught in a murderous mystery suited to London: a serial killer. The plot is a recast of his latest London-based thriller Match Point, right down to the upper-class sins and "American Tragedy" / Place in the Sun Boating "accident". In fact, Allen Manhattan is reworking Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo just to name a few other examples. I don't care if he reworks; I would like to have the new material at least as big as the originals, and unfortunately this is just a reflection of his younger grandeur. Allen as an instructor and actor cannot hide his love of the actor, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore take a mediocre comedy to a suitable place in the Allen cannon, not amazing but entertaining, sometimes brilliantly satirical: About the suspect killer in top class, Sid (Allen) quips "I would be very surprised if he killed a person." This is vintage Allen humor. While there are almost no bright literary allusions like most of his films, he makes Scoop with music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to tell that Woodman has not lost his touch to the class.
