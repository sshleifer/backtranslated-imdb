First thing first, this movie is painfully beautiful. A person working on 3D CG movies as a lighter / composer blew me away. Every second I was stunned by what was on the screen. As for the story, yes, that's okay. It's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner-esquire stories (and who doesn't?) Then you're fine. I must say that I felt that the voice effect was particularly bland and degraded by the film as a whole. I saw it in the cinema in English, but I hope there is a French version that floats around somewhere. Definitely worth a look.
