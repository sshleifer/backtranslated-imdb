Since I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be just another "B" rate movie, but I was amazed at the play of the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very skilled and orderly. The plot was wonderful and unique as well as with an excellent morality to the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly not for anyone looking for a hollow, "Dum and Dumber" or blood and gut. This is a wonderfully beautiful film that shows some ugly realities in life combined with the kindness of human heart and just enough enmity to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I prefer this movie to many "A" movies I've even seen a large number of high earnings in the box office. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
