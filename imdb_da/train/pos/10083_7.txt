The fact that this movie was posted on DVD that is still formatted for TV and with a fuzzy picture, has really annoyed many movie tourists ..... and rightly so. This deserves a much better treatment. The story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft (today's rules) and wins up with a little girl instead (not the conventional way) .... and the problems that follow. The old one had bought the child at a slave auction and soon discovers that the child is not a boy whom he of course thought was the case. The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind of funny look with a missing front and a contagious laugh. The little girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a treasure. The rest of the story is how the two are doing I like a good sentimental ending, but it gets a little carried away in the last 15 minutes, all in all, the story involves drama, excitement, humor and sadness. Don't expect a good picture for the money you spend on DVD until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.
