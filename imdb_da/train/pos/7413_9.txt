Shower stays in itself in so many ways. Almost the entire movie takes place in an old bathhouse, where the citizens provide humor, pathos and emotional touches. The love and friendship between the proprietor and his delayed son is deep and moving. The way in which the older brother is drawn into this small world seems undisturbed and convincing. The plot is meandering, full of surprises and irons, and touched at all by a sense of what I should call neighborhood in the relationships and conflicts between the performing artists. This is a movie I pull out when I want to believe in the world again.
