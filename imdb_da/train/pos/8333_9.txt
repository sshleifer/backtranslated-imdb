IQ is a wonderful original romantic comedy that throws the greatest and deepest thinking scientific minds in the 20th century as Cupids helpers. Heart and mind compilation is the central theme of this light-hearted but thought-provoking film. You don't really know how to react because part of the time you see great scientists doing stupid things to nurture nurturing love, but in other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles in space / time of our age. The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a quirky, scatter-brained mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. All of them create a farcical journey through love and science, mind and heart.
