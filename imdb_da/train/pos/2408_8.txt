Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's Christ Passion and was bothered by the violent violence would like to see this movie instead. Although it was not a success in the cashier's office or the television rating, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a really good motive to show this yearly. I liked the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus wanted in other movies, his appearance is pretty close to what a Jewish man would look like. What surprised me or exclaimed me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus of Pilate "And never forget you are a Jew!" Though it may not have been a racist remark, Colin Blakely tried to get Chris Sarandon to look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men these days. Keith Mike's portrayal of Pilate was hollow and compared to his earlier performances in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The History of David". But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savalas or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really painted the impression of a Roman procurator.
