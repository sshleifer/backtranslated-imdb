Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore having seen a large number of these movies, it is rare that you find me completely unique. For that matter, it's just as rare that I gas for breath through the laughter of several scenes. The love story is a little thin on the ground, but I guess I'll say the best, since this romantic comedy emphasizes "comedy", and at least the limit of credibility extends a little more than I like most rooms com is doing. The four researchers gave some of the funniest moments not only in this movie but in any movie I've seen for a long time. I hesitated for the shortest moments before finally choosing a "10" over a "9" as a rating, as I think too many people are using it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses part of its impact . I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan who helps, but this is one of the few movies I've seen where I want to say she's completely overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are thrown like the leaders, but for me, second fidle plays to the dizzying intellectuals. A real ridiculous movie.
