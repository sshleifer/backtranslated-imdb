I loved this movie. I am a Mexican and was at least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should appear on police officers throughout Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is as messy as a 3-month-old corpse. It scares me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a ridiculous fine or living like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned up vigilante. Kidnapping is booming industry down here (at least in the big cities). In fact, I wish that reality kidnappers liked the same fate that one Creasy did his good work on. It would be so wonderful (sorry, I'm so angry!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping movie that you can't miss. It may be difficult for some of you if you are not used to reading subtitles (the Mexicans do it all the time while watching American movies), but the effort will be worth it. Some of the editing is a bit unclear ... kind of traffic, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts a bit slowly, but the pace picks up hectic in the second half. I swear you will cheer as you see Denzel Washington sending the wrong perpetrators. His performance is nothing short of excellent. The end (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. A "must be owned" for a DVD collection! 9 * out of 10
