Imagine that I was missing out on this great cultural event on Swedish TV last night, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the television (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!) That I came across it (yes I had seen an ad for the past, but of course forgot it and looked forward to an "early evening" ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - this must surely be a rather unusual idea - basing a movie documentary on an interview made with sound more than 30 years ago. But with animated and other documentary film material, it is a really good and obvious portrait of one of the 20th centuries most valued literary artists - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> I will definitely read my Tintin album with another eye after watching this movie, making it easier to connect the style's variations as well as content with the different periods of Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I want so few of the few I do not have. Of course, my perception of the album has changed for more than 25 years, as I have already read them, like my view of which albums are my favorites, but it adds (at least) an additional dimension to them.
