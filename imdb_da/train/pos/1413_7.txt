In 2006, AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on Earth. This film was March of the Penguins, which was told by Oscar-award-winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now. They have taken their staff on live action movie production and it has been hit and missed across the board. Disney then created a subdivision called Disneynature and launched its first feature film, Earth. This is definitely one of the most touching and informative documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Calculated by the great James Earl Jones, the Earth does not offer anything new to anyone who has seen Discovery Channel over the past five years or is following the Global Warming crisis very closely. The Earth touches the issue very deeply and takes a very liberal approach to the subject. It allows an emotional connection to nature that I have not experienced before. It shows not only the beautiful and mystifying parts of our beautiful planet, but the shallow and disturbing aspects that it often entails. It is one thing to see "Mufasa" fall from a rock into a stampede or Bambi mother being shot by a hunter in the middle of the forest. It's all good, because at the end of the movie we know it's just a movie. This shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all types of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make a real movie experience. Although it is a bit heavy on the film's graphic character (which many people disagree with), the earth is a touching experience. There is a fantastic cinematography work here by a fantastic camera team and a fantastic score by George Fenton. Compared to the March of the penguins or the grizzly man, it doesn't really matter, but it stands well alone. At the end of the day, you grow an appreciation of our planet and a little sadness, as many of us will probably never visit these places we want to see in the movie. We live here, but it's like we're never going to explore the planet for some reason. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
