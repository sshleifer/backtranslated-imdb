This is one of Joan Crawford's best talkies. It was the first Gable-Crawford mating, and made it clear to the MGM and the audience that they were an exciting team that led to making seven more movies with them as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly depicts a brother's and sister's downward glide, which, after their father has lost everything in the stock market, must defend and work to live. Life is difficult in Depression, and soon their attempt to find legitimate work is in vain, and they go to the underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as a socialite-turned-minor. She is smart, complex and trustworthy. She even speaks the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early Talkie plays. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who gets involved in Crawford's character. That same year, he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", which secures its position as the top male sex symbol on MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, don't miss "Paid" as she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early talkie performances. <br /> <br />
