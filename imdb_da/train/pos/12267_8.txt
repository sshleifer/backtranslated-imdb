Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant display of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin. The filmmaker's personal experience with the interview Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist, who inspired the Chan character, was very moving. <br /> <br /> A great documentary from a very talented and beloved artist. A good example of a person who has become internationally renowned and has enjoyed millions of children (and the young at heart) all over the world.
