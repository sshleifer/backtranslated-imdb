Although some reviews were clearly lukewarm, I found the story quite enchanting, and although some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', then what? It is good to see a warm touching story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience sniffed and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are passionate about each other, even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage. However, I felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, might also be played as a pantomime villain. As it is rumored that he was actually Victoria's true father (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent), exploring this theory would have been interesting. Emily Blunt is quite convincing as the young princess caught in the swell palace with hips and politicians out to manipulate her. She portrays excellent character and determination that ultimately made Victoria a great queen of England who flourished like never before during her long reign. I believe that mouth-to-mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.
