Although this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I see it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> A particular quote in the movie stands out. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) pulls up to his office and parks in a handicapped place, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "can't park here, it's for the disabled". <br /> <br /> Danny answers, "I'm disabled, I'm psychotic". <br /> <br /> It is one of the many lines in the movie, no matter how many times you see, you make yourself chuckle. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously is in my top 5 comedy / ghost film all the time. As an added bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in cast. So watch this movie and like myself and many others who have seen what you are getting hooked on.
