I finally watched this movie tonight after renting it from Blockbuster (VHS). I agree that it is wildly original. Yes, perhaps the characters were not fully realized, but it is not one of those films. Instead, we are treated to the instructor's eye, his vision of what history is about. And it doesn't stop. And to be honest, I wouldn't have it. I think Sabu should have influenced the director of 'Lock, Warehouse & Two Smoking Plates' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I absolutely loved the way the three leads SEE the beautiful woman on the street to distract them shortly. I really need to see this director's other work because this movie really fascinated me. If you want insight, culture, storm and urge, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal hilarity, look here.
