I just watched this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it was just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane came in boxing because she wanted to. I thought this movie was good. I gave it an 8/10. It's so good it is. Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. She herself has been in only six.
