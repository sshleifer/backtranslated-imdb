I bought this a year or more ago for $ 2 (yep, $ 2), left it on the shelf for years, and watched DVDs as they got cold. <br /> <br /> This is a scary movie. Brilliant performances by everyone involved, especially the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). Plot reminds me of maybe my favorite movie ever, Grosse Pointe Blank, but of course it's fancy is heavy-hearted. As a psychologist, a clinical and forensic psychologist, a tremor shifted back as the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary stuff! Brilliant work all around. <br /> <br /> Pete
