I saw "El Mar" yesterday and seemed to be a good movie. It starts with a childhood episode in the lives of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. Then we jump about 10 years in a hospital where the 3 friends meet again. Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality rage the whole movie and create an intense and thrilling movie. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the movie is too gory and I think they missed the point of history. It's a fierce, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. To be hurt. To bleed. And I think that what the movie shows is not made for pure shock value or presented in an unpleasant way. I know some people like their movie "clean", even those with violence in it. But sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work. This is one of those movies. And a big movie is it. The only mistake I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details were not 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, it was all reasonable. But it was not of great importance to the overall story, so I still give this movie a 9.
