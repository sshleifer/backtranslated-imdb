Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or so) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to see. However, the same cannot be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible, and I'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I should be honest) to see it is Peck. Besides, it is better to just read the Old Testament.
