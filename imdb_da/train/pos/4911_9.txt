This movie has over the last ten years become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences. The three storyline threads given us by Kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures. The domestic chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between rooms, the small gestures like the phone book Barbara lies on the chair under her son, so he can reach the table, the small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well designed and natural. More than anything else, I love their porch, the other living room where it is clear that they spend much of their summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between Widmark and Douglas' characters. It cannot be completely original and gets a little blustery, but overall it comes across as genuine, respectful and effective. The third thread, the grungy tale of Blackie and his tattered little gang, gets us closest to a dark and scary noir world. Panson's Blackie is as cold as an ice block. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-made man obviously has a complexity that we only briefly come to. For me, this film remains a completely satisfying experience.
