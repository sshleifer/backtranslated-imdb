I just watched this movie on Showtime. Absolutely random indeed. If I had not only had 6 hours of sleep in the last two days, I would not have come home early from work. If I hadn't come home early from work, I wouldn't have seen this movie. I wouldn't have known what I was missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> That's the way this movie is. It almost plays on the Kevin Bacon effect. It and causality (hence my verbiage above). Ever characters are intertwined in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is just amazing. I need to find a copy to buy.
