Lubitsch's last production, but not his least interesting film. Somehow, critics are ignored when he couldn't finish it himself and when the movie was not signed by Preminger, whom he made the most of the scene ... A very strange mix of musical (a memory of The Merry Widow?) And classic Lubitsch touches on sentimentalism (an impossible love story as Cluny Brown), yet a very clever and intelligent, yet not to be understood as a nostalgia for a lost world, but rather a testament to eternal feelings ruling on man's stupidity and especially men in wartime with a "moral" lesson still true today, as it was in 1948. Billy Wilder in response to Preminger who mourned Lubitsch's funerals for having lost a great man replied that we still had his movie and it sums it all up about the lady in Ermine ...
