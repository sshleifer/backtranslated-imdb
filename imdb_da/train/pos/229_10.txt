In today's world of digital manufacturing, there is no computer that can replace the actor and author. Alas, this type of "character driven" movie is too rare these days. Duval's achievements as well as James Earl Jones are true to their audience's high expectations. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a "close-up" personal quality to the story. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding. The only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a large film photographer, but beautiful pictures are not everything. How can talent like Jones and Duvall continue to produce such fine work at an age where the actors make up digitization?
