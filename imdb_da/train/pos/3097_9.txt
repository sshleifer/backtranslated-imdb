This show was amazing. It was intricate and well-written and all the characters where you liked to be terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake was welcoming the philandering girlfriend. When our airwaves are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that wasn't for soap opera as well. It was always exciting to see how each figure would be associated with the next circumstance. It's really annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little and get it thrown out because of some mysterious numbers that most of us don't even notice. Some of us are not getting. This show will be missed perhaps by many people, but by some pretty loyal fans.
