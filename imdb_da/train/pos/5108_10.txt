This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie. It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I first saw this movie with my Aunt Brend and Sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I've read many comments on why Bud left Sissy & how Sissy should "learn to act" married. But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, not when I was eight, is that Bud & Sissy's relationship makes a trip for the worst because she is fooling on him by Gilleys riding bulls. They come in a big fight. Bid tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. So Sissy thinks two mistakes will be right, and Wes asks her "she needs help". They are all on the dance floor that seems like fools when Bud asks Pam, "When should you take me home and rape me?" Pam response: "Anytime you are ready Cowboy". Bud then goes home with Pam for her condo in downtown Houston. Which father bought for her with her oil money and "all that involves". Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Bud. Then it's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he's a real "cowboy" and win her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has theirs, I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I got myself a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
