The subsequent two seasons of this original series were less than deficient. The latter seasons catastrophic conversion contributed to its three season short lifespan. Maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season, it would have got a cult following. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the first season was really fun! Witty, wise with excellent writing it was promising. The first season excellent brew had the right ingredients - characters / actors, history and so on. Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to start. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" on the prowl night after night, day after day for the exclusives. Many things do not make sense to me. Like how this shows and another fav of mine - Gross Pointe never "done it". If only the first seasons of the naked truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, would you please someone out there?
