I can agree with other comments that there was not a huge amount of history discussed in the movie, but it was not a documentary! It was meant to entertain, and I think it did a very good job on it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. Like suddenly it would be thrown in, but I grabbed the story and the connection between the families later and found it quite good. <br /> <br /> Despite not being a resume of the 60s, it brings to light very large and important milestone periods in the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth looking at.
