This is one of the most spiritual movies I've ever seen. I headed up with about 150 people to St. George and we watched this movie in St. George temple visit center. Not a person had dry eyes in the audience. There were also some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by the captivating music and resumption of the pioneers' history and the difficulties they faced because of their faith. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through. After all, it's American history.
