I have been very fond of Laurence Olivier for the past few weeks and was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I have always found it wonderful when I run over a movie where I don't have to have my finger on the remote control, whose nudity reads its ugly head. The divorce of Lady X is charming to the last scene and must have been a real joy to the viewers back in 1938. I just want people today to be able to accept and love true humor instead of the horrible garbage people now call fun. <br /> <br /> The Divorce of Lady X is worth everybody's time.
