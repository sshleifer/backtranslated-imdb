The film is about Anton Newcombe. Music and career in the two bands is simply background. It is only fair that Newcombe has the last word about the movie, as in this letter you can find in the "news" section of the brianjonestownmassacre website. I want to connect it here, but IMDb won't allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are limited by what the camera captures, as well as the need to assemble a coherent tale from the somewhat random occasions when the chance has put the camera's lens on a line of sight with relevant coincidence. In You! Successful smile on Dandy Warhols, who captured their rise to the pop-idol candidates' status as they created beautifully-produced mass-consume pop-ups, especially "Bohemian Like You", a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro mobile phone ad. <br /> <br /> No such luck to Brian Jonestown Massacre. The movie captures a bit of what made the original BJM lineup great, with the only exception of a single one-minute or so installation, showing that Newcombe creates / records a number of short instrumental parts that cannot be noticed and Ends the sequence with a play of the lush, shiny sounds that may have been in Newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the movie; one of the filmmakers, and two of the members of the tapes (the BJM track is exclusively former members, and without Newcombe). Both Warhol's and the BJM alumni point to this assembly sequence as the "best" piece in the film, and I agree that, given the film's focus on Anton Newcombe, it is the only part of the film that distinguishes proper light from his gift and seems too short to give the right balance to this tried portrait of the "tortured artist." <br /> <br /> Interestingly, commentary is that unlike movies, they are recorded in real time - a long take - that can be more honestly revealing than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing. <br /> <br /> The Dandis don't get well into their comments. If the rock-roll world expands the experience of high school for its citizens - which I think it does - Dandies are the popular obsessed preppy types, those who listen to rock, because that's what their peers do while the BJM crew comes like the half-rejected, half-self-connected outsiders (for insiders like Dandies, "losers") who are the real rock band. BJM's Joel Gion, who speaks a lot, nails the film's message to me when he says (paraphrasing): "You can't forget that Anton was able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do. Great music." < br /> <br /> The Dandies suffer along the way for every monstrous screen during Newcombe's crash (all BJM footage ends here in 1997 before Newcombe stops heroin). Courtney Taylor-Taylor's discount on Newcombe's commitment to his vision is summarized as follows: "He's 37 and still lives in his car. You can download all his work on his website. He was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else, he is giving it all away. He could make a mint. <br /> <br /> The film's defects cannot be due to the filmmakers; It is rather the difficulties with the documentary form and the loss of collaboration from the film's subject, which makes this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary. But it's probably the best we get outside his music. <br /> <br /> I only rented the washer one that has the function. Most of the extras are on disk two. Don't rent what I've put in my order to buy sets.
