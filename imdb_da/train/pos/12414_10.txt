Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a prison screen prison (like "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 80s. Twenty years before, guard Lane Smith had mistakenly executed a condemned man. Now he is managing for the newly opened prison, and the man's ghost is left for bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very moody movie has lots of cruel acts and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are in advance for the entertaining carnage.
