I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced when he returned. So when I saw part of this movie one night on a pay-for-view channel, I was fascinated. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt when he was ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it's the most heartbreaking movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way it draws you in so many different directions emotionally is something I've never experienced with any other movie. As far as the Vietnam movie films are concerned, I think it's the best, even though Platoon runs a close second. Besides all that, I also think it is Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like him in most of his movies, but in this one he was incredible. I gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies.
