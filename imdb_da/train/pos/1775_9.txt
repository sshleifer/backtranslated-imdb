I often wonder why this series was beaten so much. I thought it was brilliant and also very wisely written and done. I believe in the future it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever issue it. Many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and everyone went on to bigger things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and it must be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and not least Julian Rhind-Tutt from the very successful Green Wing. Authors Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the finest comedians in the modern age. Anyone who can produce comedy as Father Ted could not be able to write something that was not worth publishing. If ever it is issued, I will definitely buy it.
