Barbara Stanwyck gives this early Douglas Sirk-directed, Universal-produced soap just the kick it needs. Not least as memorable as Sir's later melodramas, it is easy to see by seeing "All I Desire", where Sirk would be artistic in the years to come. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to his family in smalltown, USA, after leaving them a decade earlier. Her family and community have mixed feelings about her shocking return. Some of the cinematography is amazing, and Stanwyck is hard-as-nails and really gives this movie a shot of energy. Overall, a pretty good show.
