Young Mr.Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most honored characters in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time making him human enough for people to take care of. Maybe the actors are the best performers. See how he once stops a lynching mob. Alice Brady is great in the role of a simple farmer woman. The majority of the movie plays in a courtroom, and the only negative thing I can say about this movie is. Most of the characters from judge to spectator get so many folksy humorous lines derived from the serious trial that is present. But I am very used to it because humor is a Ford brand. Supporting parts of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
