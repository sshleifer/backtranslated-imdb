For a low budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, now starring on the TV show "Dragnet", is sexier than ever. The location was ideal for the ganster plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie can use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. Although this film has its share of problems, such as continuity, I have to say that I would hire the instructor's next film. If you are a film student, you can learn a few things from the director's comment.
