This movie got horrible reviews, but because it was rude and because critics usually didn't "get" unwanted movies, I thought I'd try it. Unfortunately, they were pretty much right in this case. <br /> <br /> The movie only has an awkward feel to what is most pronounced. The kind of feeling that is impossible to describe, but it is not a good one. To further confuse things, the script is a tedious pointless thing that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The immensely talented Thurman just drives through this mess and hardly creates an influence. Hurt and Bracco try unsuccessfully to add something to the movie with enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. It could have been less embarrassing for them if they had just chosen to drive and get over with Thurman. <br /> <br /> However, one thing that the "appreciated" film critics failed to mention is that the film is actually quite fun. Whether it's moments with exact satire or some outrageous weird moments like when those cowgirls chase Hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashed ... ahem ... front bottom. Because of the chortles achieved throughout, while I would not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to be had and even see hunter cowgirls get Blues worth for something else.
