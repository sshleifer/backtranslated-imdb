In Brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to Brodie's famous bet that he can jump out of the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story known to many people through a 1949 Bugs Bunny spoof, "Bowery Bugs" from 1949. This generally very funny movie would probably be more accessible if it was not for the infamous and disturbing scene involving some Chinese tenants - a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, which in my view gives the film a great historical interest.
