This film is about development. People are growing and people are fading, people are surprising and people are disappointing. It has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love, and hatred. It really is a classic drama that has amazing performances from all over, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in his debut role. <br /> <br /> This movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this movie be mandatory every Saturday in all the prisons in the world - it affects your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit it: I slip a glide of joy during the last scene.
