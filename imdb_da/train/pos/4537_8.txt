I watched the movie for the first time in the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle and I really wonder what Sherlock fans are thinking about it. I also think it is a movie for these fans, whether they agree or not, what is mentioned. You could ask yourself was A. C. Doyle a strong person or put him in the question. But he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much was that kind of semi-biography? Nevertheless, I strongly advocate this adaptation, it is a movie you should see - even if you are not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - see it, enjoy yourself and get your own opinion about it.
