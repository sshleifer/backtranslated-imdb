Othello, the classic Shakespeare story of love, fraud, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of the fact how fascinating it was that Shakespeare captured the sense of friendship, love and racism perfectly. I think that when you really study this story, you can go into so many philosophies as to why Othello became insane by jealousy in blinking eyes. But later on for my report I also saw this version of Othello, and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth only record the story so well and understand it is dark. Othello is the great time soldier in his city, he is loved by all, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello settles with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is confused, but avoids it. Othello is welcomed in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago who has been standing by Othello. Because of his crazy envy he is out of revenge. Still telling to be Othello's best friend, he just tells met at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, never saying they are, just making Othello believe it is happening. Othello is insane and has no pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help him out. Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend reading it. It's an incredible story that keeps you in mind after you've read it. The Othello movie is also amazing, and I recommend it again, it captured the story perfectly and has a great tower love type, or you could just be out of the way between Othello and Desdemona, how fast he thinks his true love would betray him . This is a great movie, great play, good sets and good direction, that's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
