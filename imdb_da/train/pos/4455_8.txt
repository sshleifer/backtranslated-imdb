Although I liked the city better, I really liked it. I'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I had heard of them, I had never seen anything with them until recently. The first thing I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of genes. I also think that is better. But I thought this movie was good, and like all movies, there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book it's a great movie and I love it. Frank and Gene do a good team. I haven't seen them together in Take me out to the Ballgame yet. But I hold onto my weapons and say that I really enjoyed it and that I love it!
