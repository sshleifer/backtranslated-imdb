For a low budget movie, it was really good. I put this well over your average action B movie. Sean and Corinne were delivered in this movie and they did not seem to be camera-like. Watch for the comers of Jeanne and Jared. I didn't think the producers themselves would consider it, but runner-ups deserve so much. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to more of Sean and Corin's involvement in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very genuine, and sexy Corinses character was pretty hard-hearted and on point. She was well connected with the action sequences and performed with confidence. It was a good idea to throw Billy Zane as the clever and twisted villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to see. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. The action sequences were not cheesy and seemed to link throughout the film. Of course there were shortcomings, but it comes with the territory. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a great movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for television. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering they are new players to the game. I hope Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast get their chance to also participate in their co-stars in entertainment success. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: *** / ****
