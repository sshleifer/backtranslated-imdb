I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official choice for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it for the best picture. Justine Priestley is warm as the psychotic, but complex Amanda. This is not your regular psycho movie. Lots of interesting and original snakes on the genre. Kind of a "deadly attraction" for the younger set of great blues music blended in as the subject of Amanda's love is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband when her career starts. <br /> <br />
