OK, so I don't see too many horror movies - and the reason is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I caught this (a surprising feature-filled) DVD and it scared me stupidly. In fact, the only thing I think the DVD was missing was a few new pants. <br /> <br /> But the next day I told somebody about it when I realized I had only seen about 10% of it. For the rest of the time I had seen the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if I actually covered my eyes. The few times I was brave on the screen, I jumped so hard that I decided not to look up again. <br /> <br /> Film production is solid and the characters' situation was really convincing. Simply the movie is what really caught my jump button - it's just a forest, a hut and a disused prison - and a lot of darkness. Most surprising to me was the fact that even though this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the makeup effects really worked out as it was! It is also obvious that this is a movie made by someone with great love for filmmaking. The sound design and music have really used my surround system as many Hollywood movies never did. I noticed on-line that this movie won the LA Shriekfest - a really great achievement, and I assume that the festival had seen the clear talents of the filmmakers - and quite a lot more of this movie than I did. <br /> <br /> Turn up the sound, turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
