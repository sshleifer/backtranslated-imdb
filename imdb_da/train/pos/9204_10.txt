The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he was visiting for the protests against his former Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in spirits because his films were against, and some had burned Prem Pujari's posters. But the lives of the hippies found a story in Dev's mind to be made into a movie. <br /> <br /> This was perhaps Dev's best instructional effort. The movie was a great super hit at the ticket office and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister made a huge impact. <br /> <br /> This movie was Dev Anand's call to the nation to stop their moral values. <br /> <br /> It's about a Montereal-based Indian family, and the brother's role is a very loving one for his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate to leave Prashant (Dev) with mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother have died, and she believes she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is ill-treated by her mother-in-law and she runs away from home. Dev grows up to be a pilot, and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with some hippies. To reunite his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz) who would later marry him and also Janice, who is actually Jasbir with a new name and a new identity. She also forgot her childhood and Dev. <br /> <br /> Dev will get his sister back from all the other events that include being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu, and the people are after his life. <br /> <br /> This was a story that was really straightened and acted - both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da did not want Dev to make the movie. He was very close to Dev and his former film Prem Pujari, but was good but had been against in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject when he thought hippie cult film could regain people's anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the movie Soothing Burman Da, and the movie was actually a success. <br /> <br /> R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good figure. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie.
