This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (the movie by Tim Burton). But it is a less glamorous and more in your face story. And of course it's not dad, but his grandfather telling the stories. <br /> <br /> The movie's story also moves back and forth (so the story here on IMDb can tell you more than you'd like to read before watching the movie). It's fun and engaging enough, even if you come from one story to another and also have some dramatic moments. It also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn't expect. A nice little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : O)
