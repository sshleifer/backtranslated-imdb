If she escapes the life of being hit by her father (.. and speakeasy waitress) who dies in an explosion, Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who simply ravishing) enters the branches of a Big City Gotham business. When a possessive lover who was to be his next father-in-law (and Lily's new lover) is the heaven border of Lily, as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety, it is known that the papers will receive it if certain wages do not come in the hands. Newly appointed president of the bank, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of rejecting lots of dough, but soon finds herself in love with various meetings with her in the city of love. This makes Lily's mouth water, which now she has achieved the success of seducing a man of wealth and prestige, giving wealth to his way. Although circumstances arise that will make her make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving these rains. Trenholm, now her husband, is accused of imprisonment and has lost the bank. He needs money that Lily now has in his possession, or he has absolutely nothing. Stanwyck is the whole movie despite the usual Warner Brothers polish. Being set in the precoded era gives the filmmakers the chance to delve into taboo issues like a woman who uses sex to achieve success and how it can lead to tragedy. Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtle tips in various ways and figures through good action by Stanwyck's seductive performance how to distinguish something without showing the explicit action. Of course, the film shows that money is not everything and everything that jazz as love enters into the heart of Lily's dead heart. What ends up having lily achieves the miraculous metamorphosis in a loving person who did not call true to me. She has been using all the time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him.
