While the main story is to take place in Morocco, this film was shot in the fog of Romania for 18 days on a very tight budget. But their broken cards can be, the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and dedication, so I eventually found the result both touching and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gives a formidable performance as the bad guy. The script and direction give some pearls. Whether you like the movie or not, it will probably depend on you taking the Alexandra City in the title role. Other reviewers have pointed out the City's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I found her interpretation lovely and very appropriate. Modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline, innate talent and courage. The city seems to do the same here.
