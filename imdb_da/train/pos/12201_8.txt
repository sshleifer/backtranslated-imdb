Produced in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai were one of the great films made by Welles after returning from the relative exile to make Citizen Kane. Dark, brooding and expressing some early Cold War paranoia, this movie is high as a film-Noir crime film. The cinematography of this film is filled with Welles' distinctive quirks of odd angles, rapid cuts, long pans and grim lighting. The use of surrounding street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening image of the Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and sequences of Chinatown can only be considered the inspiration in many ways to Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it is Welles' occupation with technical cinema that hurts this movie in its entirety. The reason for this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible mess of movie techniques. But despite this criticism, the story combined with wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) makes this movie a joy to watch. Orson Welles not only pulls out the Irish brogue, but the worn-out identities as the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at that time, breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and plays a role with true depth and contradictions. Finally, Glenn Anders' strange and bizarre depiction or Elsa's married partner is nothing short of classic!
