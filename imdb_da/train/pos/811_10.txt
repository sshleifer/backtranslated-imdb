When I think of the return of the Jedi, I seem to be epic. Yes Ewoks was in there so what? They are an interesting addition to the movie (not to mention they resemble Vietcong, who could also shut down a technologically advanced army with primitive actions). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the movie. Palpatine is so evil and evil, Father resembles Mr. Rogers compared to him. Talking about Darth Vader, what a great end to such an iconic character. Vader is really a modern Greek tragedy, and I think people can now understand and appreciate this especially after Sith Revenge came out. His redemption at the end was in motion and really brings a happy but bittersweet feeling to you. The best part was of course the special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties can still be the time trial with its graphics. The scenes at the Jabbas palace (Leia looks great in the metal bikini) and of course the epic three-way battle at the end is still great to watch. In all of Jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and incredible special effects are an appropriate end to one of the most beloved movie history franchises.
