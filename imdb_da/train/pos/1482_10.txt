The best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection on the couples coming to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the lives of our children. The actual burglary or help from 'friends' - or fines if we leave -. The real role of the family: they can help or they can destroy us. The evil priest, who may not be very angry, tells what could happen according to the statistics and reality. A couple who think in a 'special' marriage lives a painful story in their future own history. <br /> <br /> Who likes contract marriage? No, after the priest tells their own story ?? If they leave the future in other hands, if they do not know what is the marriage. That the problems are true that life requires a genuine commitment, guarantees, from each one. That the true victims of the divorce are children, with real name ?? Andrea in film or names. That abortion is only an easy departure: Sadness, regret and misfortune will be there after abortion. That the state and the social security each time recall a real problem with the families. Gossip of friends, adultery because of weakness and desperation of Steffania, because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. Maybe someone can think that this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in their deep hearts, do they like a beautiful marriage and a family, if not why do they like marriage? A genuine and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: of each of their decisions, of each action in their life. The family could be a place where each one feels loved because it is his or her, only by existence. The play is wonderful. The performances are good: Steffania and Tomasso, the second-sighted priest! An excellent direction and script. The colors and the control of the cameras, excellent.
