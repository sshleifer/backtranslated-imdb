If you've ever wondered why they're not doing porn with a plot, then see Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give the Armstrong credit both to make an effort to exploit this idea and to use such a strong adult cast to put some power behind it. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes clear why most pornography never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue linking sex scenes together. These people simply cannot act (and sadly, the story is paralyzed). <br /> <br /> Still I gave it 7 because it was a good try and there didn't seem to be much of an attempt to cut corners. I would also like to see more experiments like this one. Maybe one day I will see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
