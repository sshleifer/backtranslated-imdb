For fans of the Troma or Cyberpunk genre mixed with a little bloodshed, watch this movie for you! There is a good amount of bloodshed within the framework of this movie, also the effects can be impressionable and awesome. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not to be chained to what we as the audience expect of movies these days. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy are the little foreigners I found sweet. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Also recommended are films such as Tetsuo: Iron Man and Versus for the weird Japanese film approach, filled with wonderful blur and bloodshed. Of course, you should watch this movie you already know about the two.
