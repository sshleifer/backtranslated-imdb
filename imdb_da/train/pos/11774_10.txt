Is it a good idea to use live animals for the department store's displays? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why .... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned", sales that Bugs are helping promote are over and the store manager (Nelson) transfers him to a new department: taxidermy. Of course Bugs objects and fun begins. <br /> <br /> Use almost every department store (children's wear, sports, shoes, costumes, women's nightgown - don't ask.) Bugs come out on top at every turn, even refer to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE ". Even when it is trapped within the framework of a lift, Bugs make the best of the situation. <br /> <br /> Director Jones is on top of his picture play as always, like Blanc (like Bugs, natch) and Nelson (the leader - who looks like the radio support Gildersleeves - go ask your grandparents). <br /> <br /> And an anointing advice: When faced with a fuzzy woman who wants to try bathrobes, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument yet for animal work legislation.
