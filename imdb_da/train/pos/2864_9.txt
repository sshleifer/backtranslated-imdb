It must be an ongoing joke about Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all, Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son at each marriage. And any woman involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe should end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the widow's formula and the three sons who started this classic television western. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Bonanza was made today, the authors would have had revolving women coming in and out of Cartwight's life. People have relationships, some go well, some are not so good, it's just life. And we are less demanding of our heroes today, so if a relationship with one of them goes south, we don't have to kill the character to keep survivors' nobility intact. But that was if Bonanza was done today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while to tackle and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was the ideal television dad in any genre you want to name. His entire life was used in the hard work of building the huge Ponderosa scattered for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but everyone got together in a squeeze. Cartwrights still became an American institution. I am more people about this family than Kennedys. Only the popularity Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as eldest son Adam was written off the show. Rumor has it, he did not care about the noble Cartwright characters he felt bound to be sanctified. Maybe if it was done now, he would have been better off in the way I describe. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning of Michael Landon, where many people get three hit television shows for their credit. Landon also has a highway to heaven and a small house on Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. the show continued with the two younger sons, but when great Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added then, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But great, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the Cartwrights most lovable. His sudden death after the surgery left too big a hole in that family. <br /> <br /> So Cartwrights of Ponderosa has gone into history. I got a really good taste of how America took Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, right where you see Ponderosa on the map at the opening circles, Cartwright is home, the set is maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street to Sherlock Holmes fans, ranchhouse and Cartwrights are genuine. <br /> <br /> And if they weren't right, they should have been.
