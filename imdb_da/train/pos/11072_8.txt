It is simply. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with con and chess masters. they are merciful about his story of loss and failure, and complete misery, which he lives because of his belief in his masters of small tricks and control of the rules of the offender. They decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: from his inner fear, from what he thinks to be himself. for they take him on a journey, where he may release all fear, all pride, all hope of being born again as true lord in his will. <br /> <br /> It's a smart movie about the journey of light, the infinite gambles and games we do with and in ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
