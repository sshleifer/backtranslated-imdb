I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007). This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie. Adrienne was a wonderful talented writer director, an original and outstanding artist. She managed to show everyday miseries with absurd humor and a really warm optimistic and humanistic trend. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a fantastic performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. Male manager Reg Rodgers, similar to Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic law: <br /> <br /> "It is a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In a sea ​​of ​​pain <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You're pummeled by the rain ... Don't let the heartless come down, <br /> <br /> Do not greet the heartless at your door, <br /> <br /> Do not live among the heartless "
