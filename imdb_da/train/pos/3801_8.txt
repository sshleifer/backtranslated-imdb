This is a CGI animated movie based on a French 2D animated series. The series ran short on Cartoon Network, but its run was so short that its recording as one of the potential Oscar nominees for Best Animated Movies this year left most, I know, "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chu, the friendly heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the surgery, who, along with Hector, take their firefight, he's more like a dog. Travel the world, offering their services as dragon hunters, but never getting paid. In their lives, Zoe, the fairy tale loving niece comes from a blind blind man. It appears that the world is being consumed by a great monster and all the knights the king has sent out have never returned, or if they return, they come back ash. In desperation, the king uses the dragon hunters to stop the world singer. Zoe obviously marks along ... <br /> <br /> What else can I say, why is this movie hidden under a rock? This is a really good little movie that is completely out of the radar, except as an unlikely Oscar competitor. Its a beautifully designed, great looking movie (The world it takes has floating countries and crazy creatures) that constantly made me go "Wow" on it. The English voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is first rate. Just as big is the script that doesn't talk down to the audience using some real terms that are usually not heard in animated movies (not Disney or Pixar). It's all really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some of the pieces go too long, but at the same time it is wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, see this. Its one of the better animated films from 2008, and takes place on my lovely surprise list for 2009.
