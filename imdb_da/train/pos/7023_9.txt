I loved that this movie recognizes the viewer's intelligence, so the layers can peel off the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has affected each one. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is a beautiful and inspired reflection of the vision that I believe is a highly talented new filmmaker with maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience has failed to achieve. I see a bright future for this author / producer / director who had the ability to focus on a goal and achieve it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
