Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. Sir. Sheen, Mr Margolin and Mr Morrow are all initially performing in their respective roles Ms. Phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a television movie (25 years ago) by delivering "sex interest" in an otherwise sexless movie. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; a 1934 Ford Coupe, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, is placed in front of a camera and is given a workout that causes the viewer to breathe, grab and hold the edge of the seat with breathless expectation. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are spectacular (though some of the dialogues are a bit paralyzed) make a nice evening diversion. How to make all "car films". <br /> <br /> Try capturing this on the latest movie channel; It is worth missing out on sleep.
