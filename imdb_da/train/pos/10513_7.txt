If you have any idea about Jane Austen's production, repeat the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all movies from her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters because they all have a certain personality and typical proverb that they would like to repeat as in Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her leading role. Also, the fact that each of the characters in the movie does not seem to be able to think other than to get a good partner and soon married, makes the movie fun.
