The Titanic is a long but well-made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the unhappy journey on the invisible ship. Writer / Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this film about a fictitious love story between two very different people and combining it with the real event of the Titanic, which immersed after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 and claimed Thousands of lives perished in the ice-cold waters of the North Atlantic. The two film leaders are amazing in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They create a good pair on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry that created the romance, which eventually flourishes between those who are much more credible. They both showed real talent when this one came out, and both have continued to show it in their latest movie. The rest of the supporting game, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role, is as impressive as their characters, helping to bring them to life in this movie. The love story, the action, the excitement and the special effects are magnificent done especially at that time. The fear of the situation in which the characters were, felt so real because it really happened that you wanted most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacings were a little slow at times, and it was a bit long, but the rest of the movie made up for it's few errors. Titanic makes a great date movie that is sure to get some girls crying almost every time they see it. The fact that this happened randomly added to the movie, making you sad that all lives were lost when Titanic sank into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. All in all, the Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love, while the vicious ships are brought to life by the extraordinary cast cast, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, which definitely make this movie worth watching.
