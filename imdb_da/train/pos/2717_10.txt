I can't remember many details about the show, but I remember how passionate I was about it and how I was determined not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately we had no video at that time, so I never saw the series again. But I can strongly remember how I felt while watching it and how excited I was each time it came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he is still one of my favorite actors of the day, mainly because of his appearance in the series. I would like to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go in great lengths to see it again and go through a childhood that has gone long ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a site dedicated to the series or has episodes of tape from their first vent?
