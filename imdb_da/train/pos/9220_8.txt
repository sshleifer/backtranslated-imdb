A lovely unpretentious send up by Romeo and Juliet. Steps without expectations other than having a good time, and you will enjoy it. A talented group of comic actors let go and have a rebellion in this easy-going artist. Bad reviews were due to a snob of shakespeare treatments. Some people feel that all movies should be "important" --- if you share those views, don't bother. Credits read "introduces" Angelina Jolie, who is not even close to being true, but is amazingly beautiful as a Christmas sign, and as always, her plays are wonderful --- and given her age at the time her dialect is pretty good . Recreating this classic tale with feasting Italian families in the New York catering business results in fun. Look it in the right mindset and you will laugh aloud.
