This is not the best Bigfoot ever made, but with the latest nature standards, wrong movies have been made, mainly showing on the Sci-Fi channel, it's quality issues. It has some action, a little humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but it is also some practical F / X that I like. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of B horror / sci-fi and need a solution. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not a successor to it, so don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> The action is better than you might expect to find in a movie like this, and the director is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a cock that the characters are "developed" but know that things will pick up. If you see a DVD, you can skip a chapter or two.
