The master of film glasses Cecil B. De Mille goes west. By using three legends from the Old West as main characters (they've probably never met), Gary Cooper Wild reproduces Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill, and Jean Arthur makes a lovely Calamity Jane. The story only serves for De Mille to hang some amazing action sequences, like the great Indian attack. Kind as it is extremely well done. If you don't mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast, this is a very entertaining western.Look out for a very young Anthony Quinn essaying role as an Indian brave who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn. him at least noticed in Hollywood.
