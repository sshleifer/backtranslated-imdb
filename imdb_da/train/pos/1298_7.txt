A real anomaly in the French cinema has this desperate work nothing similar in contemporary production. You would rather look at the page of Louis Malles' "le feu follet" (1963) (the fire inside) to find something that is not quite unlike Harel's efforts. By and cynical, has lost all his illusions, the hero, a computer scientist , have no more reason to live. Absolutely no. Radiating from humanity, he seems to live his life as a kind of entomologist, studying his colleagues. One of them catches his attention: Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia plays the most likely part of the decade. Then Tisserand becomes a kind of prey: all his pessimism will rub on this poor man. The scene is the night club climaxes the strange relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he .... Now the movie has a more conventional tour, so to speak (maybe Clouzot's misanthropy perhaps), but just a piece time. <br /> <br /> The form is weird beyond comment There is t wo voice-over, one for the narrator who always refers to the protagonist as "our hero", one for the aforementioned hero. The story takes place, now in Paris, now in Rouen, Guy de Maupassant's town.In a scene with his shrink, the hero says the author's madness was merely the expression of his disgust for man, and he draws a parallel between his despair and the Maupassant's one . <br /> <br /> This depressing movie is only suitable for a well-informed audience. for the very short excerpts of X-rated movies, but because you may feel dumped after seeing it.
