Now I had the pleasure of seeing the contaminated man as it premiered on television back in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infectious disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters its home and kills them. Now a few years later he is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure how exactly the only thing I know is that it takes place somewhere in this area. However, due to budget cuts in an infectious disease laboratory, they have to dismiss most of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller (played Peter Weller, best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop), enters and demands that they give him his job back. He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support. Then he goes in, a fight breaks out, and some things are beaten, dangerous things. It is soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a fatal pathogen. In fact, it is so deadly, a drop of his blood will kill a person in seconds. Soon words come out and the disease expert (Hurt) is called to investigate and he later joined an American reporter. Now, Muller is determined to come home to see his wife and son and will stop by nothing, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said before, this movie is much like Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who will stop by nothing to reach the goal, even if they have to kill a few people in the process. Next, we have a full type person (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. Polluted man is actually a really good movie with a good story line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
