This is a good example of a fairly simple movie Noir story that is handled exceptionally well - thanks to Otto Preming's excellent direction and some great recordings. Dana Andrew's stars as a hot-headed detective, who too often uses his fists instead of his brains. Soon after the movie Andrews begins to be reprimanded for this and warned that if this continues, he will be out of power. A little later, while investigating a crime, he is attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does NOT use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrew's panic and assumes they will not believe in him, so he tries to cover death - but instead an innocent man is finally blamed for the crime. There is much more to the movie than this - including a plot with a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the better examples of the genre - with great gritty dialogue, great lighting and a simple but very effective story. That was how Noir was supposed to be.
