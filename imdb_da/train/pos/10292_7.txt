Let me start by saying that I am a great Carrey fan. Although I admit I haven't seen all his movies * cough * the magable * cough *. Bruce Almighty was fun. None of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets at the end, I don't know what the authors thought. Somehow I couldn't help but feel that this movie was a bad attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> In a positive way, The Daily Show's Steve Correl is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast. See Bruce Almighty if you're a big Jim Carrey fan or if you just want to see a light heart (que soft piano music) some fun comedy.
