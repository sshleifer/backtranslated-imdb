In northeastern Brazil, the father of the 12-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her daughter to a man in a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), who is employed as a housewife and has a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto), who blows her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenage son to get her first sexual experience. Then she sent to a brothel on a gold field in the Amazon and explored her owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro and expects a better life, she is explored by the Vera Vera (Darlene Glória). "Anjos do Sol" reveals the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever", which tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in third country countries. Director and author Rudi Lagemann presents a fantastic film that exposes reality but never shows nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an outstanding performance in the role of a scared child struggling to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória as diverse as she is after many plastic operations. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Sun Angels")
