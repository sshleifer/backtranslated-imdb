Here's another movie that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. It's a classic comedy, very fun and entertaining and of course ultimately inspired a successful television series that many would say was even better (I enjoy both, personally). <br /> <br /> For some it is difficult to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison as they were rejected on the TV show by Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe vice versa). But what we have in both cases are four good actors who, in fact, seemed so much like their movie models that they managed to make these characterizations their own. It is Neil Simon's humorous material that is the key and where the laughs really originated. <br /> <br /> For those who have somehow never heard of ODD PAUPLE, it is the story of a neurotic and pushy nice freak (Lemmon) who is cast out of a 12-year marriage of his long-suffering wife and resident in the Manhattan apartment by his sloppy and completely irresponsible friend (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls gives some very fun predictions.
