I was pretty surprised at this flick. Although their budgets apparently were missing, be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still proved to be good. The action was pretty impressive, and the story really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the end really was a little too abrupt for my taste. But hi, if your audience is back, want more, then this movie has succeeded. <br /> <br /> I really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look up Antonella Ríos, an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting). Antonella Ríos is really a star on the rise.
