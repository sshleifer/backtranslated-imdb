I thought Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it can be confusing for some of you (especially if you didn't look at Sepet and / or Gubra in 76 times). <br /> <br /> I realize you've noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? It's really ironic how the characters relate. Just like the bushy neighbor is the prostitute from Gubra. And the chicken on the snooker cushion turns out to be the pious man's religious and wife in the future. <br /> <br /> And I love absolute voice-overs. Its raw yet waking up fresh. Just as they took a shot of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin sign, there was suddenly Mukhinn's voice saying "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (the scene when he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> The captured Malaysian attitude (and in some way mildly, sneaking at how pathetic it is) depicted in the character. For example, the kids can be really sharp tongued (complete with the sharp annoying voice) and simply poor mouth ppl the whole movie long. And how can you be so busy and talk about ppl when you are not self-excluded. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this movie came to my expectation, if not exceeded. <br /> <br /> It kept me glued to the screen, I couldn't even catch my eyes. Not even going to the cinema. Ha ha.
