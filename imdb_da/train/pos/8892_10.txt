Great, great, great! That's all I can say about that movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text so I will elaborate. The shock was great (Jerry O'Connel is sooo cute!), The music was great (the 60s had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, and so was the way they did on the 90's actors. The guys seem to be in the 60s. And most of all - the stories of the protagonists brought tears to their eyes, and that is the greatness of every drama. BUT IN A WORD: GREAT!
