After seeing you, you got mail and felt disappointed, I decided to see the original movie that inspired this, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed at this movie. It is a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite films of all time. The action is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you haven't seen it, I want to encourage you to see it today. I am not against re-makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original, but this time you have to admit that you got Mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
