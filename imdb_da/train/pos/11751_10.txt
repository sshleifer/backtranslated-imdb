Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives on his former honor, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance like Jack Dundee. He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> You'll see some of the most quoted scenes ever put into a movie when Jack lifts on a rat, Reno poses, and the call of caribou goes out. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this classic, who is not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be played.
