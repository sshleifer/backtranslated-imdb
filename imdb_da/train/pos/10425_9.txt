THE BIG CARUSO was the world's largest hit in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall for a year, with most "movergoers" at home with their new 7 "Motorola television. The numbers are fake --- because they Of course, today's $ 10 films will dominate, and in 1951, it cost 90c to $ 1.60 on Radio City, 44c to 75c first round at Loew's Palace in Washington DC or 35c to 50c in quarterly runs. people who respond to the picture, not unadjusted box office "media spin." GENIUS OF THE BIG CARUSO was that filmmakers took most of the actual life Enrico Caruso (really not a big story anyway) and threw it into the trash, but instead 90% of the film focused on the music, so MGM gave us the best live opera singer MARIO LANZA makes music from the best ever historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO, the result was a wonderful movie, for late LANZA would throw his life and career away at overeating. Too fat to play the STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with Lanza's voice called in, with the formerly beautiful and non-fat Lanza depicted in the advertisement. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Don't be discouraged by the low price as it only reflects the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
