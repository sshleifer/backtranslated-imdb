Let the world go away. Take it off my shoulder. Take the things you used to say and make the world go away. <br /> <br /> Now, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a pickle, one for contemplation, and the other for kissing a child. Neither was guilty but faced with charges and their house being torn down, they ended up in, no. The whole world except their house went away. <br /> <br /> It's a little weird but fun too. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends just enjoy each other's business and do what they want. But it gets old quickly, it works. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their lives by hating away memories. The sound effects below this were great. Things were really weird at the end. This film was a product of a great imagination, written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of the two stars. It should only be seen.
