Finally, a good Modesty Blaise movie was released that not only tells a story but actually tells the "real" story. I admit it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that this is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell how Modesty became the magnificent person she is. It's not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real story. Some things might have been better, but when you can't forget the horrible movie from '66 then it's a great movie. Then you are a fan, so relax and just enjoy the real story with a cover story just to get Modesty to tell his story.
