Don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one, this is a gem! Young Kingdom Joan and her brother find themselves motionless after their father dies - and now they have to work to live! She will of course become a journalist and he is just as natural a driver for the mob! At wild gatherings, their career meets upside down thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. Meanwhile, there is the chance of a moonlight underwear swimming for a bunch of beautiful young things and for Joan to make a few risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam bucket). <br /> <br /> But none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's all great fun from the wonderful pre-days when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks good and shows much of the emotional range that would give her career such a long life (thank God, she stopped the dance!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero. Great to see him play something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother. And there are some amazing montage and tracking images with director Harry Beaumont moving the piece at a blast pace - and an occasional glance at the audience! Fun!
