A famous conductor decides to return to the village after a heart attack, where he was born to live a quiet life. There he comes in Dutch with the local church choir who wants to change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I watched this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to watch foreign films that are not English and I have already seen a few Swedish films in my life, but this was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this movie is a jewel thanks to many things, one of which is the excellent actor. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as the thought-provoking, almost shy and devoted conductor Daniel Dar√©us. Beautiful Frida Hallgren is enchanting with her beautiful smile and her subtle play. The cross members are all well-developed, interesting characters with their own story each. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who devoted his life to music, and trying to create a quiet existence in that village where he was born while trying to make peace with the past and with what his life has been until then. Kay Pollack shows us that Swedish are excellent filmmakers. Go see So, as I heaven, it's a movie that makes you think of life and love, and it's also comforting in some way.
