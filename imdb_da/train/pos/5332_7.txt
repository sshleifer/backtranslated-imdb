In the face of bad reviews - or car accidents - I feel like getting in gear and making a transfer to make a profit if it is because of it and do a favor. I'm not sure people are licensed to say it was so bad, almost automatic. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE. This movie maintained excitement, it's the whole length, for me, despite any errors that might be. How many movies can say? Not even many big ones. Because of the simple premise, you do not know if the people come out of the life-threatening situation that lasts the entire movie. The suspension was tight and over some shocks the shocks did their job. It's not just a TV movie but an all-action movie; There is no point where it stops or deviates or becomes talky. It would be difficult to make a movie like this, always on the road. Only Duel, or Speed, is what I remember. The best in them was also the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING IS NOT BAD: The judge is as good as ever and the others are. <br /> <br /> The SCRIPT is good. But the jury is wondering if it can sometimes be - or seems to be - a little off the record. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily that. Your first judgments are not always true, but I think the main actor was right to be in this movie. STUNTS is mostly fantastic, especially for a TV movie. Their only failure may be the noticeable, and again, seemingly slow speed. But we all know how fraudulently slow Grand Prix cars can see. <br /> <br /> I liked that the BEGIN said "inspired by a true story". So you won't go how much is true? You just know that the foundation is. The usual "based on a true story" makes me believe that it should mostly be true. But maybe it's my fault. <br /> <br /> Saving them: Good idea of ​​the proofreader to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels. Just a few inches would do. A stunt driver could do it at 100 mph. Strange that they did not call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there is a way. I hope this review has put in the reverse that this movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help it become an ongoing success. <br /> <br /> The pick quality is a bit soft for a DVD. SPOILER: They would have been shrouded after the baby, but strangely, the life-saving idea was wisely addressed in some fun conversation to fade it out. I guess we know why. End of movie. Suspension of disbelief went into the top window with the child.
