For fans of the 1970s Hammer-type horror movie, this movie should be a treat. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode. In general, however, this is a solid, eerie little movie. If this is not Amicus best movie, it is definitely one of them. The best episode, justly saved in the end, is the one featuring Jon Pertwee as a horror movie actor - it's really great. Almost Pertwee was in this role, it is hard to believe he did not do any of these types of movies. All in all, this is an entertaining movie that scared the heel out of me as a child and still gives me creeps to this day.
