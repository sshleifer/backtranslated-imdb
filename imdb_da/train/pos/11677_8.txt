I loved the Long Way Round and wasn't even aware of the Dakar Race until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little 'hmm it will be so good' first episode, I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great as were the other members of the crew. Great to see him with Ewan again. There was a good deal of swearing in it, but it didn't bother me. As for not mentioning it on the package. It's more to do with the silly excuse from the BBFC Classification Certificate. They should have given it a 15 only for the language alone. Recommended series, I want more !!
