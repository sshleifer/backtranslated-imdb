This is one of the few movies I saw twice in the theater. I really love this movie for its atmosphere and its tale of the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but gets a chance to redeem. Isn't it a comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I saw it for the first time, I thought the movie after the chosen election would be over - I didn't know the book. So boy was I wrong when the dramatic climax still had to come! I was literally swept away by the powerful force of the film's last half hour. Many people here do not like this movie completely. I can't understand the one bit. Perhaps those who read the book first, are - as often with screen adaptations of novels - simply disappointed that so many things have remained unclear, unseen, inexplicable. But as a film telling a touching story - the story of a family, a man's rise and fall, a woman's deep compassion, the strength of love, and the insanity of hatred and conservatism - this movie is simply amazing! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good, and the casting is also wonderful - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. So definitely one of the movies that the cinema was invented for!
