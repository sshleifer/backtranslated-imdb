Can't imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all go "Chick Flick" on me. I am a very big and masculine, Macho Man, who happens to think this was one of the better movies in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The storyline was amazing and the story was amazing. This is wonderful medicine for the heart and the soul. The action could not have been better, nor the movie better cast. <br /> <br /> For a while, I've known that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Lady Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench are among the greatest actresses ever to be seen on film. And of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this movie) can in fact surpass all of them in the quirky magnum of her talent and varied roles she has performed over the years. At least it was a fantastic cast. This movie was like a book you can't put down and once you've reached the last page, want more ... even more. I can't understand for my life why this movie here at IMDb only bets a 3.9. <br /> <br /> This rating here is absolutely fantastic for me. Or maybe not. Maybe I actually understand it ever so well, and that's what makes me very sad. It makes me ever so sad that movies like "American Beauty" "Leaving Las Vegas" "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" ratings skyrocket out of the cards in popularity when, in fact, at least in this viewer's opinion they should have received a "R" rating ... R it is too "bad". Hi ok, I realize there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but this is a sad comment when this lovely, powerful ... extraordinary, Directed, Acted and written movie seems to be overlooked. Of course, it was also at the Academy Awards .... How sad. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a strong, happy, sweet, beautiful story? see ...... preferably own this movie ...
