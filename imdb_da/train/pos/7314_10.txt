The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what was first and foremost my attention. I was expecting a gore party, but instead got to see a very intelligent killer whistle with my head to a chilling soundtrack (that's actually my ringtone at the moment: P). That I couldn't predict when he would kill and when he had disappeared was a big plus in my book. Predictable horror movies drill me. Now I know the story had some inconsistencies, but if you are like me, you won't even notice them long before the movie's over, and you lie down to bed laughing at the fact that you've just seen a masterpiece in motion . Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all-time favorite theatrical scores, so I was very happy to hear Rob Zombie leave it untouched in his remake. When I talk about remake, I read a very comprehensive article about it, and now that I know Mr. Zombie honors John Carpenter, I have great hopes that he will take on this classic. This movie is great at any time, you have a desire for a spine, but it's the perfect addition, open, final, you name it to an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
