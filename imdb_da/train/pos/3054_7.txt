"Panic" is a criminal comedy drama with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the leading roles. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people to live. But at the moment he is facing a depression, and therefore he sees a therapist. This is where he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and he falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to finish the family business (killings), but he does not now do how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a guy during his midlife crisis facing the common problems: falling in love with a beautiful young girl and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Exactly good acting performances by the player. Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this and it was a good movie, but he didn't deliver completely. The story was pretty flat and clich√© .. <br /> <br /> 7/10
