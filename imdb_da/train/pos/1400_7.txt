Bogmeister and others have largely won this. Shore Leave is really TOS 'first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic problems with Tribbles). It gave both the herd of Enterprise and its television viewers a necessary respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, The Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place to relax for a while, Enterprise is happening across a seemingly idyllic M Class planet and sending an exploratory team down to look at. Soon enough, all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly dangerous - but it all seems to be a sense of human emotional extremities played out in a weird mix of amazing mystery (McCoy has gone through the looking glass), psychologically thriller (Kirk is stalked by an unimaginable bully from his past) and romantic comedy (no comment). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of the entire series in the Trek franchise, so it's easy to forget how many episodes in The first season focused on heavily handed, potentially calamitous drama. Unlike the later series franchise writers, the TOS production team was not afraid to literally go where no TV series had gone before. And Shore Leave, despite occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner - ironically given his legendary sense of humor) did not seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on ST's themes. The last scene may be one of the worst scenes I can remember from all over TOS races - both compositionally and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendation - see it while you see the entire first season it was supposed to be seen - that order.
