I missed the whole season of the show and started watching it on ABC's website in the summer of 2007. I'm absolutely crazy about the show. I think the whole casting is excellent. It's one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC program lineup for this fall and didn't see it on the schedule. It's really sad. I hope they'll bring it back ... maybe they're waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it just my wish set? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments about the show and see so many glowing remarks that look like mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision, or hopefully another station will pick it up.
