Costumes and makeup were great, there were some exceptionally fun lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as well a job as could be done considering the rather disappointing script writing. Sure this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you want to spend so much money making a movie, at least give the story enough body to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth seeing, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a great classic, by any measure.
