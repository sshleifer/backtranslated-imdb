I first saw this movie 25 years ago on UK TV and just got it again last week on a DVD copy purchased by eBay. I had remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful fashion plate make up and clothes, but the plot is weaker than the previous Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding movie Spring in Park Lane and Maytime is not that good for this year's review. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the movie, charming, fun, debonair, seems to have fun and on top of his form. Worth seeing for him alone. Anna Neagle seems a bit matronly beside him, and a little too old for the part she plays, but in the late 1940s their movie partnership was well established with the cinema that became public. Spring in Park Lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote in the long term his great respect for Herbert Wilcox as director and instigator of this London series of films.
