This movie has scenes coming back to me in the weirdest times - the intense scene with Mr Muckerji told Mrs Melandez that someone he spoke to witnesses, the girl was pushed out of the window by a woman who fits her description --- is one who rolls around - the way she is referring to him by name --- in a Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and then when Boyer discovers she has just married and gives her a last slap on the page off the head before she dies --- it's a pleasure! "Fools - Fools - all my life" ... etc etc - you get points .. I have to buy this one. I love Dan Seymour's play - he usually plays a nice foreign sultan or police chief and performed in Casablanca and many great pictures.
