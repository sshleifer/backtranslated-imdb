I saw that movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you've always dreamed of it - you can get it. This shows a great desire to come into reality the clothes of happiness and sadness, hopeless and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can do things differently and be happy.
