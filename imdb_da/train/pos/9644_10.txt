I'll give it to you just ... this movie is great. Foreign gay films are so rapidly surpassing American gay films in production quality acting and history. while so many American indie gay films are grainy, bad sound, amateur, trite stories and a surprising lack of nudity or eroticism, top quality foreign gay films have blown like this from France. The kinematics are beautiful, well thought out, meaningful. The story is adult and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow), the play is intense and professional. Both leaders are amazing, as well as the whole cast. the boys are more than just lovely and there is plenty of full frontal nudity. You follow the whole boys of these boys, from their encounter to the end. All the small nuances of a relationship are the details of falling in and out of love, it is beautifully done. It left me as more. check it out!
