This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - blunt editing, little to no continuity, insane dialogue, bad (you can even say non-existent) plays, meaningless stories, shots that go too long for a long time ... and it's perfect for MST3K-style riffing, not to mention "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Scratch on forms ... take a shot - Write your name ... take a shot - Catch a bad Foley edit. .. take many, many shots. The only reason I did not rate it higher than 8 is because there is not enough free nudity and because despite its crazy badness it is only an hour long - hell, a movie like this must have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!
