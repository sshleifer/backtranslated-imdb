Excellent movie showing the pathetic life of two nutty old ladies. They could not live together or separately. Babbling constantly, sometimes at the same time, they have harvested and re-healed the past; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda. I found myself laughing, but for the most part I was taken with the utter sadness and abandonment of these two women. See this.
