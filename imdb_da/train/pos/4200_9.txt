Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is irregular: a "Red Scare" movie without hysteria, where the Communist threat is no more than McGuffin's ignition. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; Unknown to any of them, it has secrets crucial to the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was overseen by FBI agents who are so charged with theft as the man who runs her fat comsymp Richard Kiley. In attempting to download the precious movie, both sides help Thelma Ritter, a streetwise old jane who is always up and running and willing to sell what she hears. Fuller draws from a sumptuous mansion of tempos and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, his midsummer Manhattan takes a sweaty shine that is almost sharp. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix of tumors and bids, and they are scored to "Again", a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, and also starred Widmark. The pace escapes Ritters beautifully written and played death scene - among the most reverent vignettes in any noir, and a kind of mirage oasis in a movie featuring sentimentality. This is the author / instructor Fuller's only work within the strictest limits of noir cycle; His later exploration of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld USA) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfactory as Pickup on South Street.
