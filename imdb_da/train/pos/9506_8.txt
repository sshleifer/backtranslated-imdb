A sober, reflective piece, a small miniature that blooms into a magnificent human imagery that goes beyond pure dramatization to the screen. This quiet little story will keep you excited - if you don't have too many problems with the various Spanish accents ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, and Marisa Paredes' more authentic Iberian peninsular use! Garcíadiego has achieved a perfect fit from the novel: even the great maestro García Márquez should be proud of her amazing work. And hats off to Arturo Ripstein, who has so much coordinated the whole effort in a gem, a ruby ​​and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so soothing ..... El Coronel - Fernando Luján - Waiting to Get His Pension, while continuing to live in his shovels lumber deep inside the Colombian jungle (though filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his camper and his wife (in that order?). And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh so much more .... This movie is a rhapsody. I have to see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible. Well worth the high side of 8 out of 10 which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> These are not bright commercial Hollywood stuff.
