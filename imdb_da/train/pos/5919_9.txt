Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just look for fun. It's not a pleasant experience, even though it has some laughing moments. This is a movie you see when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> To reject this movie, it's just racist to miss the point altogether. This is not just a satire of song in the south, it is also a biting commentary on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group portrayed in the movie appears as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how absurd these solid attitudes really are. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who is willing to acknowledge the cruelty of the prevailing prejudices, American culture still holds, and if you are not afraid to see your own prejudices in the eye, this can movie to you.
