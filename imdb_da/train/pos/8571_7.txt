It's probably a very good "sequel", better than the first live action movie 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and really slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has had some rather larger therapy, is now a dog's dog and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. Others like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe she's changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick with his girlfriend has born three sweet Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another villain, the name should give a clue), this is a good family movie with excitement and much more !! A downfall of this movie is that it has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last movie. This is also more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
