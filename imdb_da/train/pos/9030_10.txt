This movie surprised me. My friend told me that this movie was a "chick flick". Boy, was he wrong! This movie has a great family appeal, with no sex scenes like _other_ movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is doing an excellent job in Homer Hickam's shoes. The support molding is also great. <br /> <br /> Science, Upcoming Age, Family Wreaths, A Great Train Scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite choppily. The 50s music kicks the film over the edge of greatness. The DVD is definitely worth weighing in coal. The replay value is fantastic - I've seen it quite a few times already.
