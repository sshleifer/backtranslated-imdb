There is no connection whatsoever between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are police crimes on violent crimes. Profiles look crisp, Fortier looks classic. Profiles plots are pretty simple. Fortier's plot is far more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect if we are to look at similarities ... The protagonist is weak and weirdo, but has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. What about just enjoying? Funny too, people who write Fortier look American, but on the other hand they argue to prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The action is not superficial at all ...
