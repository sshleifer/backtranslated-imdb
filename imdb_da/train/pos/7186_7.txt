There have been many Zorro films made over the decades, but it is a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion is slightly different from other Zorro movies. First, it is a republic's series of 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but instead of workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast such a strong presence during the affair as the others, he does an appropriate job, helped by not being the only one here; As the title suggests, he has a huge legion to call on. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the setting is not California. The story here takes place in central Mexico in 1824, where a man who constitutes a living god encourages the Indian Indian people and a ban on helping him in his plan to overthrow the newly created Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro and a handful of supporters plan to do everything they can to stop. Don't miss me, there is at least an incredible cheesy moment per. Episode, from corny "twang" bow sound effects to ridiculous plays. But overall, this represents one of the best republic's series at all times, and probably the best Zorro. The plot is stronger than most series and never becomes incomprehensible or chronic. And there are lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movie will notice many bits borrowed from this series.
