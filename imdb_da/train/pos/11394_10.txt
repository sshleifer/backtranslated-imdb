While the story is sweet, and dancing and singing in the bulk of the movie is a joy, the film's unique character (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It has the combination of the highest form of real American music (Gershwin), the fascinating beauty of French impressionist art, Kelly's enchanting choreography (including his rapturous "pas de deux d'amour", truly a separate genre) with the most fantastic color ever imagined for the set. It was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist who matched the exciting music and the visual explosion with these dances.
