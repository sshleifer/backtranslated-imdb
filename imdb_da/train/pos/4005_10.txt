While at one point I thought this was going to be Graduate, I have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an elderly woman. I'm so glad this is a British movie, because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they had, they would have destroyed it by not taking the time to develop the characters. The story is slowly and realistically revealed. The action is amazing, the characters are credibly flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen and I was always wrong so I was very fascinated by the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I have to admit I will forever look at my mother in another light!
