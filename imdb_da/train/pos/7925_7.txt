Stupid movies are really, really fun. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a little too obvious, it falls a little in the second half, and the story is an incoherent mess, but it's laughing fun all the way. And it is worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right wing cook. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly fun, underappreciated movie.
