Reed Hadley makes a better sharp Don Diego than he does a dashing and bold Zorro, but it's almost next to the point because this series has the bar - no best theme song of any serial, ever - and the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous scene coach stunt. There are other great stunts, lots of action and lots of high-end rocker chapters chapter endings, but if for no other reason you should watch this movie to see the stagecoach stunt and then watch it again in slow motion. It's amazing, and despite the lower budget for this chapter game, Yak is better off stunting here than he did in the much more famous movie "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones, Eat Your Heart Out: This is the Right Deal!
