**** SPOILER ALERT **** Throughout Australia, summer was transformed into rain and hail, the size of baseballs that caused chaos in coastal towns like Sydney. It is under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, became involved in a defense lawyer case involving a local aboriginal death found dead outside a Sydney bar. <br /> <br /> Having died five other aborigines arrested for Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, determined by the police chief that Billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. Nevertheless, the court decided to prosecute the five for his death, which charged them with violence rather than murder. <br /> <br /> David, who defends the five, gets no help from them in their defense, with the accused attackers choosing to stay completely and keep what happened to Billy to himself and take what comes to them from the court . One of the accused, Chris, David Gulpili, somehow begins to invade David's dreams as if to tell him what was really behind Billy's death. <br /> <br /> Initially, David doesn't take his dreams of Chris seriously beginning to sense their real when he meets him at the court. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange looking black stone that David saw Chris have in his dreams. Later, Chris and what turns out to be an aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula) who came to his house that night, David is told that he, as Charlie, has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather. These forces will show him the future, which has to do with the strange weather conditions that flood the Australian continent. Earth, Chris tells David, goes through a giant cleansing cycle with the old world being washed away and the new world ready to take its place. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what both Chris and Charlie tell him, but as the rain continues to rise and the ocean waves rise, he feels something terrible will happen. David wants to know if it is all vain folklore or there are some scientific facts or logic behind their end to world-like revelations. Now it is obvious that both Chris and Charlie are members of an aboriginal tribe right in the heart of modern Sydney. It alone can get Chris out, as well as his four friends, for Billy's murder. Since the Australian Government will not prosecute tribal ancestors, leave any justice to be performed by the tribes themselves. Chris still refuses to admit that he is a member of a tribe, and he and his four friends have been convicted of Billy's death by the sentences to be delivered by the judge within days. David is now determined to find out what was the cause of Chris's silence and why Billy had to die, Chris is taken to the scene of crime. It is there that David finds out that Billy betrayed Chris' tribal members by going there with Billy not being a member of Chris's aboriginal tribe. It is also obvious to David that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the Eastern Aryan, as both Charlie and his father-in-law, Rev. Burton, David Parslow, told him. <br /> <br /> The scene is now set for the big and final cleaning cycle that David has seen in both his nightdream and daytime vision. It comes in the form of a massive tidal wave that rolls out of the Pacific Ocean into the Australian coastal city of Sydney and then the entire continent.
