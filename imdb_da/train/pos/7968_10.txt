I first saw this movie when I was about 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything special. As time went by, I watched it sometimes, and it started to grow on me as I began to understand the film's morality, which I come to later. For a while I left this movie alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (now 15 years), I dug out of VHS of homeward bottom. Having seen this, I was left on a natural high that I could not explain. The movie gives an overwhelming feeling of joy that you never really expect. The film's character of three completely different animals that work together to find their way home, really sends a message at home, no matter how different you are, you can always find common ground, something that you all need. The way the character of the personalities is chosen is truly amazing. Thus, you have an old scientific wise golden retriever, looking for or leading 'chance' the fun-loving, if somewhat clumsy, young American bulldog, with sassy the clever, vulnerable but trusting cat. The movie follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible that it creates magic because you start believing that this journey can happen. <br /> <br /> I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies, I assure you, I'm quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this movie is undoubtedly shadows back when shadow trying desperately to escape and the chance and sassy, ​​being painfully told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners, there is a silence until the shadow lips over the horizon to everyone's awe. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny waste, but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This movie may not be the Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to produce such a fantastic movie using animals and to lift me in. The way it does even at this age deserves it 10/10.
