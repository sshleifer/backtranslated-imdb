I recently watched the '54 version of this movie with Judy, and while I appreciated the story and the music, I found that the movie couldn't keep my attention. I expected the '76 remake to be the same story, except with a Barbra twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price of it all. This version is so much more real than the '54, with possibly better music, better acting, a more gripping plot line, and of course a deeper love. I don't understand why the previous movie is on the American Film Institute's top 100 list, while this gripping remake fails to notice any critics list.
