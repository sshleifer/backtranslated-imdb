I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. It is beautifully busy and the story holds a nineteen all the time. It's hard to believe this was made in 1946, as the story is still fresh today and really makes one think. I'm not very knowledgeable about film technology but the special effects in this movie are great when you consider this. In addition, the actor is fantastic and the use of English and American actors is quite amazing. I recently bought the DVD, so now I can see when I want it. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British movies to watch this.
