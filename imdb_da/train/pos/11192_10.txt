I've screened this movie several times here in college, and every time I show it grows the number of people with me exponentially ... besides the virgins, I've already shown it to see it again! It takes a little while to get into it, but in the end the room screams, shouts, shouts, reels repeatedly, repeats the dialogue, and is completely immersed in the movie-based experience that is Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady"! Scene after scene after scene with the most eerie busy, poorly written, terribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all-out attack that ranks as the most camping thing I own (no small statement, friends). For me nothing compares to U, Pia ... and I don't suppose I'm the only one who ever felt this way!
