Seeing David & Bathsheba is a much better way to get your Bible lesson going to Sunday School. Despite a script that is sometimes unintentionally fun, the movie is very entertaining. The studio system had its faults, but it did not save any expense as it was called for a lavish production. Peck portrays King David as a lusty but troubled poet who commits to murdering in bed a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the Prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturn and fierce performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for Old Testament and Hollywood.
