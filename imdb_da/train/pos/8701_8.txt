For anyone expecting a traditional superhero movie, it may be an unpleasant surprise. It is certainly more of a drama than an action movie. It focuses primarily on emotions, and it is a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the protagonist, it always goes wrong in some way. It is because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law in his own hands and society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes a crime. Along the way, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so that it becomes even more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the movie is lacking in dynamics. It reminds me a little about the story in the latest films by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. But when there is an action scene, it becomes so extremely dynamic that before you know what is happening, it is all. But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and flashy action. The more important thing here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very limited, which also makes it harder to concentrate on the movie. So basically you have to be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? It is a very difficult question to answer. I don't think this experience enriched me so much, but somehow I continue to think about this movie and want to see it again. Mostly because of the atmosphere, which is very close but not stifling, because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all, they are young people who all have their lives to live. So no matter how hard it is, there is always a light-hearted tune when they are together.
