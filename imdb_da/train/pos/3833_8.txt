I can't believe others took such a serious picture of all this. God, it was very fun to root for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the western series many years ago. It wasn't supposed to be a great cinema experience unless it was. So what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza. It was a fun, heavy in the cheek, looking at old western. Man, relax and enjoy.
