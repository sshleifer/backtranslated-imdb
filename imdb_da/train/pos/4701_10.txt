"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment on the movie. What's more to say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A hard gangster with the inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be hard and yet could not express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will fall into the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons. There is, of course, a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. And so is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I like Moronie holding the movie from an "R" rating because he couldn't pronounce profanity.
