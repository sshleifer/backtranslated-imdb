Fire And Ice is an animated film in a fantasy world. The film is about a village destroyed by a giant glacier that is the home of the evil icecream named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who sets out to avenge those killed by the glacier. The ice pack moves through the fireplace and the princess of the country called Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill Nekron. Fire and Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He has brought us such animated masterpieces as the movie version of Fritz The Cat and some movies he has written himself as the great movie Heavy Traffic. I didn't like Fire and Ice almost as much as I have Ralph Bakshi's second job, but I still found the movie was enjoyable. It had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough. The only basic complaint I have is that I wish there was more of a story for the movie because the story it uses is very thin and there isn't much to it. I also want the movie to be a little longer because it is under 80 minutes in duration. Still, it is an entertaining action adventure movie that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, is suitable for children 8 and older. I only wished there was a more developed story, and it took a little longer than it did.
