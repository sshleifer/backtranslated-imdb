The legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story of a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-list cast led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has not only captured elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories as f. .g. Ordinary people. Many viewers can be confused and feel underwhelmed by the construction of the plot Lumet has gone here. Instead of showing it linearly, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery that has gone wrong from various points of view, all out of order. I found it personal to me to be very satisfying and let me constantly guess what would happen next time. The scripture is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are absolutely thrilling to see, and of course, Lumet has fun managing a style that he usually doesn't dive in. Lots of action and excitement to keep the audience in two hours of running time, it's a rare movie that doesn't ' Don't disappoint for a moment.
