Starlift is a comfortable and interesting throwback to the all-star musical images that each studio was about to launch during World War II. When you have stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott etc. In the film and with people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn who deliver the music, it is easy to take movies. And the plot is not even in the way. <br /> <br /> Which plot involves two air force-induced men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using as a gimmick that both come from Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthys Dad was Regel's dentist and half of the city's. The scheme seems too good as Louella Parsons soon puts them as a subject in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She must have wished Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to pay more attention to her than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publish her Hollywood Hotel radio program again today. But the rest of the plot also touched on Ruth Roman's real life effort also plays to get her studio and others to make shows in air force bases for soldiers and women going to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at Travis Air Force Base, where much of this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> A special song was shot for Phil Harris talents singing / telling a ballad Look Out Stranger, I'm a Texas Ranger helped and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup, Cooper looked like he had a good old time fooling his picture. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest of clich√©s when you say they don't do this more, but they really don't do it because you don't have a studio system that has all that talent under contract. It is one thing about the abandonment of the old studio system we can provide.
