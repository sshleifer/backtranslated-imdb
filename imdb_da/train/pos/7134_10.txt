John Thaw is an outstanding actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his reach in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agreed to take an evacuation from London's streets (World War II). That being said, the movie is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfactory ending. Some of the characters are slightly underdeveloped (especially the school teacher), but none of them are crucial to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old and the boy, and the film needs a little bit more.
