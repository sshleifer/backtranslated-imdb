This movie is an excellent military film. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but it doesn't matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing precision for good entertainment, but this is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste, but ?? as a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the pace the filmmaker deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes assigned. The story itself has been told and told several times, but it is still for a professional soldier ?? and an African American knows it ?? to report on the story presented by the film crew and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a Navy Diver and his life as Navy Diver beyond his graduation is not the only story presented. There, I also tell the story of how the Master Leader Sunday proclaimed the illegal order of its official officer, that the second-class Brashear official was not passed in his test dive, no matter how good he did, and paid the price for a loss of a strip and a change of task. . It also told the true story how Brashear found the third hydrogen bomb lost in the Atlantic off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was in the queue of the spoken line that would have snatched him in two if Brashear had not pushed him out of the way and took the shot himself. It was a complex story that was worth telling and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive way, and to see the fleet's traditions and honor preserved in such a natural and full way.
