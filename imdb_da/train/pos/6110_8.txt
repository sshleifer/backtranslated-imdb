Like "My Sassy Girl", this movie is based on a true story posted from the Internet, but this is where the similarities end. The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school whose parents hire a teacher named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a bad background, but happen to be the same age as he. Add some obstacles, martial arts (gays are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a spoiled, thuggish love-sick girl who is after him, his proclivity for diving lessons, and you can generally guess the whole story. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fighting scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spunk thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo that brings a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of that reason. And I have to say I want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than the girl from "My Sassy Girl" (personality). She has some spunk, but it's more in the sweet, sweet, kindhearted way. Signs are already most liked (so one can say that it had less of a hill than to climb than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked for the movie to its credit), and the movie is pretty smart and interesting most of the way . However, the story of sags is approx. 2/3 of the way (where it is kind of treads on known, standard fare, where there is nothing really interesting), but close to the end when it again. All in all, a fun, sweet movie. 8.10
