I got into this excellent program in around season 4 and since then I have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and get better and better with the 9 and 10 season. Ben Browder and Claudie Black have still given the show more strength and original even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, the sci-fi channel has been deleted from this amazing show without the hope of an 11 season that makes two direct to DVD movies and hopefully more. Atlantis is still strong at its 4th seasons. And there is a third spin off in the works, the stargate franchise is not near death. This TV show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has so many different things to appeal to all ages and all types of people Watch IT !!!!! 10.10
