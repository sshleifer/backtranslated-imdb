Japanese animators have a unique freedom of animation, and so they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that ultimately end up with anime fans hard drives and college students' floors, but are completely ignored by virtually anyone outside country of origin. Cat Soup is one of the films that from Western eyes should be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really it is just a beautifully detailed surreal journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue that makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties who are not interested in things like subtitles. A cat and his half-dead (brain death?) Sister travels through different landscapes of fantasy and union. There is a general theme for water or lack of it (possibly because of the cat that is drowning at first? Possibly due to the title?). There is an interesting kind of Genesis take. There is a pig that gets to eat itself. An elephant made of water. And it's beautiful, convincing, exciting and fun - provided you don't see it around druggies that can't experience something visually unique without comparing it to an acid ride. Eventually the film turns off and adds another compelling self-reflective level to the case. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
