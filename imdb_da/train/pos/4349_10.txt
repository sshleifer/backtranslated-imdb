Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son's place unexpectedly. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), has left her father. Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father go and see a farmhouse for sale. But it's not the end of their journey. Their road trip turns into a long therapy between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My People (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the manuscript, and he has done a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing. And he worked with the manuscript for twenty years, so it's no wonder it's so good. Who would be the better man to play the father than Peter Falk? No one can I tell you. And I really love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk for that matter. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter made me laugh in this movie. It's just fun when they go fishing. And how the old guy beats the youngest in the pool game and then hits him with the stick. The movie is often very fun, and I want to laugh several times. But it can also touch from time to time. You couldn't tell a story better than this has been told.
