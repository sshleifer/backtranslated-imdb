A super, unusual movie from Audiard, Read My Lips is a pulpy, lonely heart thriller. It's perfect for Vincent Cassel's beautifully grizzled charisma and has a wonderfully contained performance from Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard pops up to Jean-Pierre Jeunet: Unconventionally beautiful (she is referred to by everyone as disjointed in this movie), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. <br /> <br> This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, a depressed dog child, pursued by colleagues who exploit her deafness. Yet she finds an ami d'exploitation if you like in Cassel's ex-con Paul. Each utilizes each other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to fight through their respective situations and form an unconventional romantic approach. Devos / Audiard handles Carla's deafness and its accompanying, combed inner world with discreet and stylish style. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001), Audiard already has clear control over his handling of the excitement, action and investment of his frame with a truly visceral experience that becomes the big hit - a prophet - nine years later. 10.7
