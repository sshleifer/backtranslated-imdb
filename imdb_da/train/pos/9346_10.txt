If you don't enjoy this movie, either your dead or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, everyone who gave good performances. This movie showed that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a highly respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, when he made a couple of bad movies, then broke through with great performance in 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard and then Click, and now ruled me. <br/> <br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing to the family he has is mother-in-law and father-in-law. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) ran into him, he seemed to turn his life around. I don't want to say more because I don't want to spoil the movie, but I highly recommend this movie. One of the best films from 2007.
