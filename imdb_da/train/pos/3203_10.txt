I think this movie was one of Kurt Russell's good films. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he is a good actor in every role he plays. But this movie had a lot of effort in it, and I know it should have more than 5.6 out of 10 on the meter, but many people didn't like this movie. Oh yes I thought it was good so I think everyone should watch this movie. If you see this movie and like it, I think you should also watch Back Draft with Kurt Russel. I give soldier *** 1/2 out of *****
