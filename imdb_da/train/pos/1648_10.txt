This is one of the best movies ever made. It is a realistic depiction of rural areas that was a major part of American history. The setting is 1906 Wyoming, where life had not changed much since the last century. The movie holds your interest without the added Hollywood myths. The whole family can watch this movie and be fascinated by how life was like in America, as it was mostly a rural area. With this movie you will escape the present and witness the daily life 100 years ago. In a beautiful and scenic environment you will see the hard physical work needed to survive, as well as the constant concerns and concerns of the elements and the market pressure that will make a difference between success or failure. Watch this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth your time to watch. My only question is - why aren't there more movies like this?
