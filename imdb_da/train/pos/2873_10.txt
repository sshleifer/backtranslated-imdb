This is one of Disney's top five animated features, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length animation movie (as opposed to the 40's compilation films), and expensive depth via the multiplanar camera returns to the movie in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of ​​the era through dress and set stylizations --- a clear time period the story takes place. Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the letters are something well-developed, except the prince - left the most flat - we know he has a sense of humor and a good smile, but it is about everyone. Like Snow White, Disney has some permanent influence on the history of popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, the stepists are attractive, not as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character goes away from their otherwise beautiful appearance. <Br /> <br /> Favorite Disney additions: the mice! Also appreciated the continuity - Cinderella always loses his shoes through the film. The addition of the homemade dress as well as the following attack from the place lists was always horrible as a child - I remember the View Master showing this with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slipper shows that evil Lady Tremaine is reluctant to give up his team over Cinderella and admit defeat --- Audley would continue to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains, satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
