Boris and Bela are doing well together in this movie, whether they are against each other or paddling the same boat. I saw this one in 1972 and bought it right from Borders this year. This time it looked with my kids, I noticed 2 things: It was aware of a 3, 4, and 5 year old; And I caught a few things I didn't have when I first looked at it. Very fast story with an unpredictable end. A must for movie buffs !!!
