I saw this movie successfully just because I went through a stage where I had a new admired admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all his latest movies and thank God I did! This movie has been stuck with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story is about two girls who go on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene just tried to spend a holiday together before going to college but their trip ended with a much more complicated story. The fight they go through when they are arrested in Thailand and captured, is very moving and intense. The action is great, the pictures extraordinary, the soundtrack is great and so straight to the movie and the message is transmitted absolutely powerful. In fact, I can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I see it. I know that some people have not appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has, but I swear, this one you must see !!! I promise it will stick to you!
