I just got back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and I'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie. The reason is that the blame is about Coccio, who makes an easy and over-prioritized social message ... Well, Mr I am a reviewer, it is an easy and over-prioritized critic of film with a social charge. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go. Reject and ignore the menu. Things are ... I understand how young children can be driven to do such horror. Colleges have become battlefields for compliance. It's a really ugly sight. You have to fight your way to be like the others. It is difficult to explain, a lot of people do not understand that colleges become cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, the parents close their eyes and smile at how their lives in their comfortable suburbs are perfect. The real motif in the movie is not about what drives them. It's about this death-like quiet suburb, and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create this atmosphere in a perfect city. Cal put it well. It's a wake up call. Drama is everywhere and it can take any form. In that case, small dramas (like Andre called a bassoon to wear a J.C Penny shirt) become the worse nightmare of a whole city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme way of expressing their pain. Lack of disagreement at a time when you more than ever need to be like the others to be accepted. I especially like the last scenes where some guys burn the crosses in Andre & Cal, as if With the pain they communicated, Cal & Andre has conveyed their blind anger to their community, their refusal to think about the reasons for some actions. <br /> <br /> It might seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio meditates more than stupid or explain. What Andre & Cal live is a reality ... and a scary one that can come to other kids. <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies ... Home use and strong feelings made Ben Coccio make a very disturbing movie.
