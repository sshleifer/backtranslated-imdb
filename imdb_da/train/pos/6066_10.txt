When I watched this movie first, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was fun and exciting. Some years ago I saw another movie called: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * In this movie, parts of the * Wizards of the lost kingdom * were used in. They called this movie "KOR the conquerer". I started searching for the "KOR" file for many years because I wanted to watch the full movie, not just the parts used in * Andy Colby * -Movie. No store had this Kor-Movie for rent, and no store knew this movie. For many years I watched my old VHS tapes I had at home and what weird ... I had this movie for many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had a lot more time watching * KOR the Conquerer again. The music is amazing under the hollow film, but the best part of the film recording in combination with the music is this moment when KOR wanders drunk through the green forest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy who played Simon in the movie. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
