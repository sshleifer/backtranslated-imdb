Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspirational film. The end when the whole crowd at the stadium rises and the people raise their hands gives me a chill when I see it. It's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad child who has so far been disappointed with someone and something in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is fun and exciting. A very nice family movie with - I admit - a pretty corny happy end. But hey, it is not really the film retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.
