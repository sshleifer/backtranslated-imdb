It started slowly after an excellent animated intro, as the instructor had a bunch of characters and school settings to evolve. However, when the bet is on, the movie records the pace as it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten at. 19:00. We had a good opportunity on our way home to discuss some things with our son: mobster, help others, think about the matter when you don't want to do anything. <br /> <br /> Of particular note is the girl played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director sneaks her unexpectedly, and when she is on the screen, she is captivating. She is one of those "Hey, she sees familiar" faces, and then I remembered that she was the little girl Pepsi exclaimed about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie", the movie about parrots trying to find their way home. <br /> <br /> Wife. Eisenberg made many TV and film appearances in '99 -00, but then it was not seen so much in the coming years. She is now 14 and growing up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile really warms the screen. If she can get some more good roles, she may have a good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another three named child actor, but hopefully without some of the problems Osment has been lately. <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 yo son who has just finished reading the story, did not seem to follow the book as well, but was entertaining anyway. The end of the movie seemed like a great set-up for some successors (how to eat boiled swallows? The Escargot Kid's Style?), Which may not be so bad. It was great to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the movie was the respect / fear created by the chief president Mr. Burdock (Standard text). Film today tends to show adult authority figures as buffoons. Although he has a certain foggy scene, he steered the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin get some work done.
