In the tradition of G-Men, The House On Street, The Street With No Name, the FBI Story now comes to one of the carefully watched films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best light. While it was 48-year-old director J. Edgar Hoover who lived, it would appear in no other light. <br /> <br /> The book by Don Whitehead that this movie is based on is a straightforward story of the agency from that founder in 1907 until about the time the movie The FBI Story came out. It's important sometimes to remember there was an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover suffered it. Some of the time is also covered in the movie. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers did not make a documentary, so to give the FBI meat and blood, John 'Chip' Hardesty's fictional character was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who took the law school and instead of practicing took a job with the agency at the beginning of the twenties. <br /> <br /> In fact, the bureau was led by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. In fact, it was a gross political operation as it appears from the movie. Burns was in the periphery of the scandals from the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence, he did just that. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family, who is Stewart and wife Vera Miles, we see the FBI's story unfold. In addition, we see much of their personal family history, which is completely integrated into the FBI's history itself. Stewart and Miles are most sure to be an American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases in which Stewart is involved, arresting Ku Klux Klan members, a plot to kill oil-rich Indians, and abusing the infamous criminals in their thirties, their commitment to regard Nazi sympathizers in World War II and courage. Communist espionage in the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of prologue where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before joining the agency's history as it interferes with its own. It involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who bought a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you crawling as the offender and the story is unfortunately relevant today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if The FBI Story was written and produced today, it would reflect something different and not everything American. Nevertheless, the FBI has a story to tell and it is by no means a negative. The FBI story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies, but it's the first I've ever seen with my favorite actor in it, so it has a special love for me. If the whole FBI was set up Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better about it. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and co-owner, killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles did not just marry Stewart, she actually married the FBI as a movie demonstrates. It is dated the most, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
