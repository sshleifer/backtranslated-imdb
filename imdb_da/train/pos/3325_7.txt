OK, I wouldn't normally see a Farrelly brothers movie. I can't remember ever seeing one. I also can't remember watching a Jimmy Fallon movie. Okay, I looked at the taxi, but I said punishment and was forgiven for that mistake. But this movie had Drew Barrymore, and I just think she's the sweetest thing. I don't know what it is about her, but I just smile all the time I look at her. She just catches me that way. I think I saw Adam Sandler myself just to see her in 50 first dates. How sad is that? This was not the biggest baseball movie - it shouldn't be. It was a love story about a sad puppy hanging on the only thing that never let go of him until he found something worth giving up on. It had a predictable ending, but there was so much going on that made it worthwhile.
