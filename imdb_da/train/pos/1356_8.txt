I started to see the apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format, which, however, is very entertaining, although it looks like a lot of other reality shows. Donald Trump is wonderful as a host and chief judge for the show as well. The casting cup with intelligent people with good looks is picked as participants is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have made a lot of nap in his time, but his handling of cinematography is excellent as he makes NYC look like a character for himself. The jazz tunes combined with a great camera work make New York look spectacular. <br /> <br /> The apprentice will easily make my top 3 reality shows all the time (The Amazing Race is # 1, though). But like the amazing race, this show is always best seen in moderation. If you watch it for a while, the originality of the original will be worn quickly (in the same case as with TAR). Star World, the broadcasters of this country, made a quarrel with presenting the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, and then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you'll love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. But if you continue to watch the show continuously, then its charm will wear and FAST.
