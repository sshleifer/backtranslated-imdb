I had never heard of this movie a few weeks ago, but the concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on her last night in Europe, and they spend the night talking. It gave my interest, but I never expected to be that big. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, it is also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked cynicism in the 1990s. It is impossible to really talk too much about it, as there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are lots of thoroughly interesting things you can talk about, it's like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that matters but just let me see it. SEE IT!
