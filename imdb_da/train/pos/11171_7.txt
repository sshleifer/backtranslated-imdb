Overall, this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book, most of it is accurate. The film runs far ahead and misses some important parts. I found the book and ready and immediately wanted to make a movie (because I hadn't figured out the movie yet), but later I found the movie in a trading box at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was I expected. Overall I give these movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and common sense) and for its bad parts (great time jumping and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
