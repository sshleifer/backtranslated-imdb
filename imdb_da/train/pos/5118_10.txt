******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have seen it countless times - and usually find something new about it with every view. I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy is about the working class people, not rich people living in either LA or New York. Now it's true apart from Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small Texas city boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is where Travolta actually played in good dramatic films like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical boys in good budget movies. This is a great movie - the mechanical turf competition and the two-step dance can be silly, but you have to enjoy it for what it is. Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance) - and soon they are married and live in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real life beat of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times, men's roles are not so clear. Where can Bud prove he is a real man? He can work his dangerous job during the day and run the mechanical bull at night - he can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy will drive her pickup truck and she will also ride the mechanical bull. So where does it leave Bud? As Sissy claims her independence, she is about to ride the bull and flirt with ex-con and the prison rodeo star - a true bullfighter - Wes (the game wonderfully oily by Scott Glenn). Bids are threatened, and Bud and Sissy break up. <br /> <br /> Sissy throws up with Wes, who abuses her. Emasculating further, becomes Bud to Pam's toy, a rich girl whose father is in oil and all that involves. Sissy comes with the trailer to clean it up - Pam doesn't do that sort of thing. She writes a note to Bud, but the evil Pam pulls it up and takes credit for Sissy's housework. Bud's uncle Bob dies tragically at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance of reconciliation but are too stubborn. Later, the mechanical turf competition at Gilley, and you know Bud must win. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes tries to shout Gilleys, but you won't know that urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and wins back the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course, ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs." Maybe it contributed to their bad marriage. Or why not Bud at Pam - she wasn't so bad and had money. Or why should they kill by Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie who always tried to break them up: Marshall says to Bid: "She (Sissy) rides the bull better than you do!" But part of Urban Cowboy's fun makes it fun - and that doesn't say Bonnie Raitt is on the scene!
