Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg chose not to make the traditional linen suit. I hope nobody throws him like Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies, but Estrella Warren hardly shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have sexy this simian saga and given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the caste Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her costume that looks like a large curtain. She is cute, but all the loving things are limited to anxious appearance and a little bitty kiss at the end. Like in artificial intelligence that discusses the interspecies gender between robots and humans, but never delivers - Apes Planet suggests inter-species romance between humans and the monkeys, but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This movie features three amazing actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing on stage as a trio of monkeys and they are fun to watch. Superlative make up (some Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this hit summer movie in 2001.
