Paul Verhoeven (genius and master film maker) returns with less than perfect, yet fun in a "dirty old man type of way" Hollow Man. The first two actions are so good that the slaughterhouse's final action is disappointing. Still, I give a recommendation for this movie, because it is MIND BLOWING special effects (perhaps the best so far) and two dandy performances by the leaders. Verhoeven's moral issues are, of course, thought-provoking, and even though the film extinguished many, this film is pretty soft-nosed to old Verhoeven. Two big mistakes: Josh Brolin (aka walking ape-man) and the whole deal with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why did they get caught in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
