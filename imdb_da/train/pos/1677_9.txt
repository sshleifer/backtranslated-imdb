La Coda Dello Scorpione (a.c. case of Scorpion's Tail) was director Sergio Martino's follow-up to the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the hallmark giallo that contains all the aspects that fans of the genre have come to know and love. Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp knives and a little gore all come to make a damn of a piece of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argento gialli around. There is the aforementioned Martino, who adds his hand as director, giallo great Ernesto Gastaldi as the author, Bruno Nicolai creates the music and a number of giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and retrieves Anita Strindberg. <br /> With all this talent behind it, does Scorpione deliver? You can believe that. The film works on many different levels. It's an exciting murder mystery, an exciting and violent horror movie, and an exciting thriller. All in all, one of the best gialli around. Martino certainly knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some points in the film he almost seems to channel Argento in his approach. For example, there is a direct rip-off of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage, where the killer tries to break through the door that actually breaks out Argento's flick. Are there problems with the girl? ? Hmmm ... only minor. First, all scenes that do not follow the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will come out of nothing and you will immediately return to the bend of things. <br /> <br /> At the end, the turns are a bit too bizarre. I mean, what purpose did the scorpion poets really earn? If you do not notice the dialogue, you can easily be lost with the twisting, weaving story. <br /> <br /> However, these small quibbles aside are La Coda Dello Scorpione an exciting, exciting, classic and all-encompassing movie for giallo fans. Look it out!
