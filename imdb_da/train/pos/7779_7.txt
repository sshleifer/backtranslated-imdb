It is ironic that during the 1950s, when Douglas Sirk was most successful in audience appeal, he was almost ignored by the critics ?? He is now seen as a director of formidable intellect who has achieved his best work in melodrama ??????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????? alcoholism and nymphomania ?? It's all about the twisted, deadly connections between sex, power and money ... Stack draws a compelling portrait of a troubled drunk ruined by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, insanity, and some deep uncertainties? ? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetite, degrading to Hudson and to other friends in the city ?? Her best line: "I'm dirty." In a shady scene we see her shaking, shaking and sweating to a provocative mambo ?? In another crying alone over a model oil derrick on her father's desk ?? Symbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyranny ??? The frenetic atmosphere is both tasteful and intensified by Sir's magnificent use of colors, lights, and careful use of mirrors ??
