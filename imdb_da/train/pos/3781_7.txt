I wouldn't dare say this movie is better than the original, but it's very good in itself. The comedy in this movie is as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that make me laugh, just thinking about them. The story of this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but it does so well. Peter Hewitt does a good job of managing this movie with a great cast. The core of the original film returns to their characters in this movie, and everyone does a great job with their roles. I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films, as I did Alex Winters Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin back to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hall London Jr., who plays part of Ted Logan's father, does a really good job. The scene where Ted holds his father's body and Hal London Jr. begins to act as Ted is a great scene, and he impresses well. I can't forget to mention William Sadler as dead, he completely made the movie for me. The rest of the casting is also quite good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, I would hope you also liked this movie. But don't expect to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
