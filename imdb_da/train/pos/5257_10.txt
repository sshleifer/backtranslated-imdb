I must say this movie has given me a double personality. I have been told again and again to open up and start talking like a normal person. But it's very difficult ... no not wang. Did you find it disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get in the mood for much more. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show your grandparents, but you should show it to a teenager or an immature guy in your workplace. Anyway, back to the voice way. Fortunately, this site has some Ladies Man (did anyone in the studio note that there should be an apostrophe (?) Between e and s?), So you can always have a good little thing to say to your boss or police. I have a sheet in my wallet.
