Kudos to the authors of this movie to create an extremely engaging drama. The curious character development is a sign of a nuanced and well-schooled writing team. The audience can do nothing but help but to feel that he / she has to make frightening emotional decisions pitting the brain against the libido. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character itself, even though her predictions are rarely validated. <br /> <br /> Credit is also due to the filmmakers who breathe into the setting. The wooden shop has been transformed into a unique persona, as the film unfolds with its own features, errors, a number of highly charged relationships, and of course a destiny that is inadvertently bound to the other principles. <br /> <br /> Be sure to catch this at your local art house.
