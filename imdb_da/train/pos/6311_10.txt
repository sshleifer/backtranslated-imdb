This movie is very hilarious, and it has an amazing collection of actors like William H. Macy, who have always performed such roles, perhaps his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney who is a very good actor showing his comedian work in Cohen's brothers film "Oh brother, where are you?" resulting in being one of my favorite movies ever! But it has been difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood", here in Mexico. My city lacks good places where you can buy some good movies. I tried to buy it at Blockbuster, but they don't know it by the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find out if I have the name they gave it in Mexico, does anyone know? Because I can't remember! Bowl. ONE.
