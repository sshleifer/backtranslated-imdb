That was what I expected when star trek DS9 rewards. Not too small DS9. It was a wonderful show in itself, but it never gave the fans more of what they wanted. The company is the show. While having a resemblance to the original trek it differs enough to be original in its own ways. This makes the idea of ​​exploration exciting for us again. And it was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient of success was the conditions that developed between the crew members. Viewers were very worried about the crew. The company also has a big promise in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. While sexual excitement in a show can often become a crutch, I feel that the tensions on the business can lead to much more and say much more than is typical. I think that when we deal with such large scales of different races or species ourselves, we get some very interesting ideas and television. We should also note the performance, Blalock is very convincing, as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have an influence and strength in character that delivers good performance. The rest of the molding also provided good performances. My only gripes are as follows. Theme. It's good it's different, but a little to brighten the heart to my liking. We need something a little more grand. Don't have to be an orchestra. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. And my another complaint. They sell too many additions. They could solve this by selling fewer ads or all showing two parties. Otherwise, we will end up seeing the show's last action being packed too quickly, as it was one of my complaints about Voyager.
