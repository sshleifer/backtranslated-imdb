This Chinese movie made me feel so many similarities to members of a culture I don't belong to and far from. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps to relate to each character and to the joy of doing the simple routine things. All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and average. Is Mine, the delayed brother, showing us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate people in this universe. Another China, this is far from Chinese realism, but it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
