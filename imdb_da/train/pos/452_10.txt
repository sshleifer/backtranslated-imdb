"My child, my sister, the dream <br /> <br /> How sweet all things seem. <br /> <br /> We were in that kind of country to live together, <br /> <br /> And there love slowly and slowly <br /> <br /> Love and die among <br /> <br /> The scenes that pictured you, the lavish weather. "<br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br / > <br /> Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be described in a sentence? It takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It's the right description, but it won't prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - an ultimate "feel good" movie is the perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, friendly and magical. It's like a sunbeam on your face in the spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of peaceful happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that has actually affected my life. I saw it during the difficult times when I was lost, miserable and very lonely when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to express myself with a bit of unflattering truth about myself. It helped me regain my optimism and hope something can change and everything is possible. I had promised myself that whatever I wanted to pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did, and I was not alone. <br /> <br /> Charming, enchanting and heartwarming, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little movie is a diamond of the highest quality.
