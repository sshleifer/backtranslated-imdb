A magical journey with Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two Titans from the British cinema have mixed some amazing ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of the most brilliant early Technicolor, a weird and shiny Miklos Rozsa musical score along with the youthful exhaustion of Sabu, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and vicious villain and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well. Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, Basra Sultan, also wrote the perfect manuscript that is the appropriate grandiose. DON'T MISS THIS! Since I submitted the above comments, I have received the recently released DVD and can honestly say that I had never seen the picture right before I have seen this DVD version - the clarity and resolution are so accurate and the colors are so vibrant that I was stunned by the fantastic classic can be seen time again and never fail to charm and delight the viewer. Again, look!
