This movie is an absolute classic for camp. Therefore, it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend alive in a lasagne pan in his basement while crossing the city and trying to find her a body by checking out the local chickens. Finally, he finds a real hourglass body with an honored face of the chicken's head on top. The cut head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the cone head comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant's remaining "good" arm (the other is not really from a scientist's previous failure) and the whole place is burning down. <br /> <br /> The movie scared us so much as children that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it. As kids, we ranked the scariest movies all the time, and one was number four. Only one of these scary movies was really good (Original "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie a seven rating for the huge amount of entertainment value it offers. Its scary effect due to the poor production and the weird sexual angle when the researcher looks for the bodies (complete with porn soundtracks) scares hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it the best material to see and talk and laugh . I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I would rather go to the dentist than see "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven are the most I can give because its entertainment value is only good luck. The movie, as a cinema, is a disaster.
