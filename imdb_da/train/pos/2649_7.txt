Going with Cavemen, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a glance back at all the hominids (it's us!) Species from the last 5 million years: who they were, how they were, and how they died. Along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have about these species, Walking with Cavemen also examines what makes us human. I waited several weeks to see this and I was not disappointed.
