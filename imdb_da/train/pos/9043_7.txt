I accidentally stumbled upon this movie on TV one day. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel that was not quite famous for giving good movies. However, this one was nothing short of good. October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket researcher. He and his friends start to build rockets. His father is not fond of his sons, new found hobby and would rather see him become coal mines like himself or go to college on a football scholarship as his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. A little too predictable maybe, but it's OK because it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It is an important part, but where this is obvious the inner action is the action between the characters focused on. The story is good. It has some clichés, but it's okay. It's based on the actual event, so you can't just get out of those clichés. The signs are really good. Where the story is on a hill, the characters are brought out and manage to keep the film's action and quality high. You get to know these signs and you get sympathy for them. They are well-written and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. The sets and 50's style are thorough and the pictures are well-composed and well-lit. All this puts the mood of the film very well. <br /> <br /> The action is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are also good. All this shows a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm happy to catch this movie. It was only after seeing what I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known it, it would probably be even more interesting when I saw it. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I think everyone can enjoy. It's a bit of a good movie. Not bad at all!
