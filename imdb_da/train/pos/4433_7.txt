The story: On the island of Texel, the photographer Bob, who makes a photograph for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and desire for life intrigues Bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob gets involved in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win her trust? Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural, and the story unfolds nicely, although it gets a little on the surface, and it would have been nice if the sign is 'psychology' would have been prepared a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choice? This is what gives a film depth and something to think about in my opinion. The story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify it. So you don't learn the signs at the deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and credible way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naivety does not work completely for an adult woman. Camera work is nice and there are some amazing pictures of nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.
