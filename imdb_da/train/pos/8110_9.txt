Amazing effects for a movie of this time. A primer of the uselessness of the war and how the war becomes a care for itself. <br /> <br /> A wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now public domain and available on archive.org. No fee, no registration required. See it in a meeting and you will be driven. <br /> <br /> I'm planning to share this flick with as many people as possible, as I had never heard of it before, and I'm a hard core sci fi fan. <<br /> <br /> I want to see how others react to this movie. <br /> <br /> See it. <br /> <br /> Rate it. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
