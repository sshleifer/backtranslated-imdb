I used to see this show when I was a little girl. Although I can't remember much about it, I have to say that it was a pretty good show. I also don't think I've seen every episode. But if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the theme song. Everyone was ideally thrown, the costume design was great. The performances were also top class. I just hope some networks bring this series back one day so I can see all the episodes. Before I unpack it, I want to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, though I don't think I've seen every episode. In conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back to the air, I hope you catch it one day before it goes well out of the air.
