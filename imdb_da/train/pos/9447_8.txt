Exciting drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), unpleasant Bobby (Ned Beatty) and the cozy guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are good - there is the incredible dueling banjo sequence, interesting interplay between the characters and just the amazing widescreen cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence takes place. To be truthful, Beatty's rape has never bothered me - I am very aware that it will be false despite the good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change - Ed has tested his pacifism, Lewis gets weak, Bobby is offended by one of the people he previously mocked, and Drew tries to stay healthy. The management of John Boorman is also very safe, and the sounds of the forest and river help the mood immensely. <br /> <br /> The action is mostly good. Voight is just okay - he has been better. Beatty is also just OK - but it's his debut movie, and he has the courage to take such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is just amazing - one of his best-performing jobs! How this was not even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are all too credible as the hills. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for children. Try to see an unknown version - the TV version has been slaughtered. It is also important to see boxing box view to capture the amazing images.
