This is an excellent movie for female body-builder & female action fans! I think Sue Price did a good job in this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and turned out to be a great fighter. She has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although not a great value movie, and Sue Price's acting skills not the best I have met in my life, the movie itself was amazing, an invaluable gem for fans of female bodybuilding! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi movies, such as Terminator or Predator, but it's not the intention. The point is that A.Puyn threw in that movie a very talented body user who put her whole energy and body number to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed the movie and then with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a shame it hasn't shown yet on the DVD :-(
