"The Color Purple" is truly amazing. There is no one like that and I don't think that will ever be. It is a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer assumes. The actors are flawless and the steering is great. I absolutely loved it. A movie has never made me so happy. It's beautiful, it's the best way to explain it.
