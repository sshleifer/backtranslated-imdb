"Bend it as Beckham" reminds me of the best of the 80s teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-colored world where everyone is attractive. There are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the most happy processes, and large amounts of plot are summed up by montages set to bouncing pop songs. Nothing wrong with this. "Bend it as Beckham" is an absolute treat from the beginning to the end. My wife and I completely won over by cornball cheesiness even though we were fun of it, and finally, as embarrassing as it is to admit, we applauded (and we saw it in our living room, not in a theater) . Watch this movie and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
