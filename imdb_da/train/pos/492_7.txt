Let me first say that while I have seen every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie. It is people who live in their parents' basement and participate in conventions that carry costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this movie a seven casting aside fiction historical error. The action was better than average, but the plot kept no surprises. They tried very hard to transform the technique, but the special effects were still too much a temptation. As for the historical flaws, if you call them that, the first Capitan to pilot Enterprise Enterprise Commander April was Capt. Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement by both Riker and Kirk, we dived Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that is why a primary directive was created), but as I said, there is no reason to discredit this fine series. I hope the plots get deeper, and then special effects can take a back seat.
