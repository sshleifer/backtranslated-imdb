I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! That's the hell good! I'm not much of a fan of movies, but I have to tell you that one opened my eyes. Terrible color and fast energy. I was lucky to catch this on a screening under Zoinks! The Boston Film Festival and the story really embraced me from the start. It had many adult themes and character, and when it ended I wanted more. I hope they make a successor. It would be fun. My only problem with that is Melissa Connor's performance as Anya. UGH! She SUCKS! I've seen a block of wood pulling out a better performance. I don't know what the director was thinking when he threw her. But if you ignore her, you can't help but give this movie a big ten !!!
