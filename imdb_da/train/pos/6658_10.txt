Mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie. Don't make me wrong, I don't condemn the movie; It's such a wonderful movie and went out of the cinema with a lump in the throat. We must understand Mahatma's spiritual standing, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could possibly free himself from his loved ones. A man of such caliber leads his family and followers by example. According to the film, he spoke to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> Had there been other parents, they would have compromised their values ​​to help the son come on foot. Mahatma did not, he is true leader, who is looking for example.
