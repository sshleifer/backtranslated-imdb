With such actors as Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, how can you go wrong. Very unusual scenes, especially the modern ones. The realization of modern machinery is very effective. Here you have jet-gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area so new structures can be made. Although she is much younger in this movie, it is not very difficult to find out who the future Mrs Pumphrey of the BBC series, All Creatures Great and Small, will be! Really effective "again" by both Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The musical score is the famous Swiss composer, Artur Honegger, and it is also unusual. At present (1936), it looks like the really used big sets or effects make it work like that. Finally, it's a really good story.
