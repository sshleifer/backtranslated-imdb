I could not hold back the tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspiring all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that makes them think about what they do with their own lives. Or just something that makes you think. You see when John lives through the last few months of his life. You see, as he goes through his days with a positive attitude. At some point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggle will make you cry, laugh and find that life is much easier to live if you just take it one day at a time.
