If you "get it", it is magnificent. <br /> <br /> If you don't, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean that you have gone through a school recording. There is so much more to this film that the school shoot sometimes becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a film of acceptance, both superficially, of a traumatic event, but also of people who are different for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie of infinite pain and how different people endure it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's rage and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that half-way through the film we wonder how the director might pull a happy end out of his hat. Fortunately, the audience gets credit for being human; our intelligence is not offended by a juicy, incredibly moralistic end. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I'm trying to keep a clear head on movies that are fiction and all that. But I have to admit I was crying like a lost little baby under this movie. There were some things about it that hit * very * close to home and opened some old wounds that never cured completely. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
