Since I saw it for the first time, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few images I could actually see again and again. The great manuscript portrays the life of a bunch of women (all in some way connected) with deep understanding and sensibility. Ramón Salazar obtained a compelling film in his director's debut, proving himself as an effective player director. <br /> <br /> Not that all performances are good, though. Of all leading ladies they range from the average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation must be directed to beginner Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan's retarded daughter. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl's male nurse, and there are fine little twists from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed when I saw I was so moved that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
