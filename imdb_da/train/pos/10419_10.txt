I agree with MR. Caruso Jr. Lanza's was the finest voice God had to offer, if only he could have found the courage to go for bread brothers leave Hollywood and the head of the opera he could have been the American Caruso everyone says he could have been, but At least he is a great introduction to the art form, no bones about it, and if so, it will. see the movie, you can see why Mr Lanza still comes up in the discussion, even in my house. Someone says Pavarotti, I say MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself, if it wants to be on DVD, they must have been restored, and VHS is not good enough, but it should also be the only Lanza movie set to DVD, the others are bad and boring.
