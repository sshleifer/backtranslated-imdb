This is the first movie I've seen by John Singleton and he's a great director. The movie starts with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and has difficulty keeping up with his work. He is friends with ice cube and creatures dating Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped and befriends Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and is not sure which way to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who falls into a group of neo-Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters, and Laurence Fishburne is a political professor trying to help them. It's a great movie, and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make more cuts to the movie.
