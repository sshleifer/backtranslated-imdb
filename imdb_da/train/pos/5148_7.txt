I don't know what these movies are. But film about history or religion is always criticized by their accuracy. Of course, this is not 100% correct. It is difficult to make 100% accurate movies today, even when the "experts" disagree with each other. Therefore, I would like to judge a movie with what it is trying to say, but choose all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years went too fast. The series should have been a three-part, his childhood is the first part. But if they didn't have more money to shoot more history, who should I criticize it ??? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem I have with this movie and that is the fact that it is told in a story book way. Especially the second part, which is just a sum of events that happened. I'd rather have seen Hitler more humane (more scenes where he doubts himself, etc.). Noah Taylor did more in the movie 'Max', which seems to work better, I think. Nevertheless, I am glad that this was made and owns it on DVD. Just to remember more alive what happened and see Carlyle give her best. 7.5 / 10
