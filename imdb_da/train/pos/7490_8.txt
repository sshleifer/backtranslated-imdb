Until today I had never seen this movie. It was filmed on the sentences of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and relates to a small Bavarian village, where apparently giant bats suck the villagers' blood. Frankly, it's an amazingly good movie that has the atmosphere to save and a cast that doesn't end, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play a character called Brettschnieder, which is interesting to me as it was my best grandmother's maiden name. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modulated movie that has excitement and witty lines slowly building up for its short running time, only gone wild, as about ten minutes before the end, they realized they had limited time to pack everything. From the point to the end, it is right to the end with very little of the fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb show a maturity of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case, I think they are since a source I trust more, saying the full operating time is 67 minutes. (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). Quibbling about this I know is crazy, but since most prints are available tend to run about 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is significantly smaller if it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I don't think it will mean so much since it's a maximum of five minutes, and I doubt it will make or break the movie. What ever maturity, if you like creaking old movies, does, really do it, watch this movie, it's a big dark and stormy night movie.
