This 1947 movie star was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the beautiful Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair. So I've been hanging out with Orson before in touch with evil and citizen Kane and the third man, etc. But this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well, she does a great job of playing the scared / cagey Elsa, married to a curly millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her, she doesn't know if she can live without the money the money can buy. Elsa, her husband and his partner bicker and bites like sharks Mike describes to attack each other, and his prediction turns out to be true. Several turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax of the fun house. (Think of the final shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun who borrowed heavily from this scene). I wasn't sure who the killer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is like garlic and lemon shrimp. The bowl is centered on the sea, it is subtle, sour and crisp, too much effect. These may not be the best fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The tasteful sauce enhances the nature of the pink shrimp when you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more common, common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
