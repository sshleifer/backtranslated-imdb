Could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to show a most disturbing accent, the number through tied teeth and from the back of the neck. In fact, it was spoiled for me by the movie and distracted from what was probably a good performance by him (very annoying). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a widespread accent, and although I have always judged Jeremy Irons as a fine actor, I would not classify this movie as one of his best. The film has, however, made my appetite, just as some of the other comments have made this film, which I have found very interesting, and now intends to read the book.
