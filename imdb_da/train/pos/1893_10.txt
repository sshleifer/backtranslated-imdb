Though it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, there is a charm to Dudley Moore's depiction of lovable lush, Arthur Bach you can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. How can you not be entertained by the contagious grin and giggle and complete sadness. Although I'm not really a Liza Minnelli fan, she was really excellent as Linda Marolla, and I couldn't see anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the movie and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the casting is also excellent and the amazing melody "Arthur's theme", wow. This was really one of the best comedies in the 1980s. Big movies get better with each view, and that is the case with "Arthur."
