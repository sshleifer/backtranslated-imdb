There may be a special reason why The Fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. I just said goodbye to my new fiance - someday - for an unknown period I was a little overwhelmed by varying emotions and suffered the fallacy of putting on the brave face she had to see. /> <br /> I saw some movie and television shows, but my interest darted from what I left behind for what's out there and what I didn't see. For that I have to thank this movie. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and hearing about the movie in advance, I was sure I would like it anyway. But I didn't like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical masters are amazing. How did they do that? How did they catch the animals they did ?? It's just wonderful. The morality of history is a good one, and while the end is oh so French and ambiguous, it is a happy / sad one. Again it got me a little foreclosure. As a man who usually keeps his feelings to himself, the end was tough while he was on a plane filled with people I would see for the next 15 hours! Maybe it's because the ending made me think back to what I left. <br /> <br /> But for the few hours on the plane I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Sure, there are the things you love and feel comfortable about ... but the great outdoors has many mysteries. So next time I see something out of the ordinary while it's out in the open; I have to explore it, observe it, and embrace it. This is exactly what happens in this movie, and that is exactly what you should do with this darn movie / nature movie. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months on the plane. We still do not know when we will be seen again, but we do.
