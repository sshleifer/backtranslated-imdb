New York, I Love You is a collective work with eleven short films, each segment running about 10 minutes long. The shorts do not relate precisely, but they all have something in common, love. Every single card is about finding love, whether it be a couple or just two strangers who chitchat. The film stars an ensemble cast, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin . With such a star play and such an interesting premise, I expected a huge movie; The problem is New York, I love you, don't add. It's still the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are so pointless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) that it is appalling. The film is completely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Historically, a couple of film students seem to be able to put together. That said, the movie also has some good moments. One of the best is the segment of an old couple played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who goes to Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And these are moments like this that made me viewers, wish the movie was more consistent because there is a lot of potential here. But as unsatisfactory as the overall story ends up being, for me, movies and soundtracks saved it all. The editing was perfect, the way the movie was shot was very impressive, and the ethereal soundtrack couldn't be more appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental movie, and in most experiences there are heights and lows. That's how you look at the movie as a whole that will determine whether or not he enjoys it. It may be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
