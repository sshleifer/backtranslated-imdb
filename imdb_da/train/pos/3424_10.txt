The information in this movie is well known to many who have been aware of the news lately. The Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we do not do a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows further is a truth that is common to all wars. The psychological trauma suffered by soldiers during war and difficulty when returning to civilian life. They are not just changed or influenced, they are different people, and most do not know how to handle it, as they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film shows what the military does for our young men in women to get them ready for war and the policies and practices they have to follow to prosecute war leading to all the psychological trauma . <br /> <br /> We have over 3,000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer lifelong physical and mental trauma because of this war. It doesn't matter which side you are on, it requires you to know the cost of the war to determine if we should be in that business. This movie illustrates the cost to men and women perfectly.
