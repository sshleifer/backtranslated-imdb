Stargate SG-1 is a spin off kind from the 1994 movie "Stargate." I'm so glad they decided to expand the topic. The show rolls from the very first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill must again through the gate to meet his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Throughout the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who lets no one cross her, and there is Teal'c, a quiet compassionate warrior who endures his false god and enters the team. The main villains are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be inserted into one's brain and thus control them and do evil deeds. Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often considered a "system master". The warriors behind Gouald are called Jaffa, who houses the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until Gouald can be inserted into a person's brain. Throughout the episodes, we most often see SG-1, the exploratory team consisting of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, going through the wormhole that immediately transports them to other planets (this unit is called Stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are on-world, meaning they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with urgent problems on Earth. Over the years, you begin to see a decrease in SG -1 hold so tightly knit, and several character-building history lines. This in turn means more episodes worldwide, which is quite understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, some cases of story lines are not always wrapped up and less emphasis on street travel these past few years. But still, top notch science fiction!
