I loved this movie. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie. I was highlighted as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. You can remember me more clearly in the classroom scene as werewolf exposed to movies. I was the woman in the front row with my hands planted on my face in response to what we saw on the film projector. In fact, the double took me a couple of times so it's hard to miss the mistake. Up to Full Moon High. Would like to get to cable soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Leesville, Louisiana I loved this movie. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie.
