This game is great. You really should get it if you don't. Although it is old now it was great when it came out. I think this game will always be a classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I wanted to play this game for hours and try to beat what we did last. It's almost as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're another Mario fan, it's important. It is fun entertaining and challenging. Everything you could want out of a fantasy game except good graphics (well it came out in 1996) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
