Other commentators have also spoken the plot and the social parables and comments (or better) I could, but I would like to be part of my admiration for this little jewel in a movie. It's going very well 50 years later in every category - manuscript, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really a classic of its kind. This was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and it is evident from the first frames that made him so special that he eventually received a knight's domination. <br /> <br /> I only consider it as an "8" because it is essentially a rather light parable that examines human nature, but does not really skew and because the plot takes the easy path into the end rather than actually solving conflict between the inventor and the mill's workers and industrialists who are hunting him all over the city. Also, a few minutes of thought reveals the basic mistake of the play's logic - wear is hardly the deciding factor in buying new clothes (especially clothing for clothing); Children grow up, people change sizes, get and lose and go with the latest fashion all the time, and as long as the tissues have woven cloth. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune that provides indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> It's still a good movie. If you get the chance to watch it on a classic movie channel, you need to.
