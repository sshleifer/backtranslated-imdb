It's time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his latest passers-by, but this movie is not the one. His other films from a previous generation were BEN HOW, the ten commanders, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works. <br /> <br /> This film, made in 1973, attempts to prophesy a future land, in 2022, It is so overcrowded that humanity has been manipulated by the authorities to eat a universally produced food product called "Soylent Green "made with human meat. This bizarre and incredible movie was so ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now, assuming India's population, which would be about $ 2 billion, would be carnivores without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character this super secret international conspiracy that world powers have spoken to meet nutritional demands for overpopulation using cannibalism. Unfortunately, for the producers of this movie, the green message they deliver is not the green party of today's ethos of praise. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until only 40 years before this film was made, but has long been abandoned by human civilization. Another silly prediction in the movie is that women are quasi-sex slaves returning to the radical feminism's tides, which were on their way in 1972 when this film was made. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid and so silly now, but contains a very lasting movie of late and great Edward G. Robinson, but still no valid reason to revisit the movie, except Academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a dud of a movie and I won't even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this movie I have read all the same, referring to a dystopian society in the future, where the central theme only seems to involve the United States where an ecological disaster has emerged. <br /> <br /> Only profit in the movie is that the earth is facing overpopulation.
