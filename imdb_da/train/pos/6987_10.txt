Put the UFO "thing" aside. This was the best documentary I've seen. Actually reporting Neil and Buzz ... one should see. Interviews and reporting are a revelation, as most of the information was stamped confidentially in 1969 and released only in 2006. No documentary to date has details or accuracy for as short as 47 minutes ... FACTS will blow you away and you will be abandoned by the risks taken to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Ever see a man save his own life? Don't bet Neil saves his life, as only a few seconds separate him from death. Great to see. It's a travesty people have not known all the details associated with landing on the moon and the courage the men had when confronting a particular death, from a mistaken computer ... 10 stars!
