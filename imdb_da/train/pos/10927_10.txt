This is one of my favorite Kung Fu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers of the late 70s. The plot is interesting and twisted, the characters are cool each with their own style - toad, snake, lizards, etc. The action is limited in comparison with other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but what is interesting with different kung-fu styles on Display from the different characters. I recommend this movie to those who believe that all Shaw Brothers especially Chang Cheh's movies are alike, most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and Shaolin vs Manchu conflicts. This film is fresh in comparison.
