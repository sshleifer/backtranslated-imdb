It's a colorful slasher movie. It's about it. <br /> <br /> It has the mysterious element that SCREAM made so popular in slasher movies, but I never like such things. Finding who is the bad guy is not that interesting considering the tracks, all are misleading anyway. <br /> <br /> The death scenes were inventive and gorey, bringing memories back to the 80's horror movie as of Friday 13th. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to determine the surviving girl, unlike in SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was clear. <br /> <br /> People who don't like slasher movies don't like this movie. As simple as that. I really enjoyed it and I plan to see it again while waiting for more of the same. <br /> <br /> --MB
