Sidney Stratton has difficulty maintaining jobs at various textile factories, primarily because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with a formula for a new substance that would create the ultimate substance that never gets dirty, never wrinkles or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money when a moth has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The movie is ideal, and only Ealing could have done that. Guinness performance (and a great support cast like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the movie a pleasure, but the real hero is the story itself, a good satire on business and with more elements of drama, romance, and excitement. Rating 8.
