This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults wherever they are in their relationship. As a husband married for 26 years, I empathize with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows it. I also enjoy its monotonous delivery; will never be too tight or too low. A good ensemble of characters. This will be a nice addition to Monday night. <br /> <br /> I don't know how David Spade will be in his role. He enjoys it best in small doses. He also seems a little old to be trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and look forward to seeing how the series evolves.
