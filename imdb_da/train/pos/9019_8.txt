I do not want to give * anything * away here, I just want to say that this technically excellent, flawless and uplifting little tab will reward the viewer with an excellent one and a half hour of entertainment: It will entertain, surprise, possibly embarrassing occasionally and almost certainly drag on heart strokes from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ends without becoming clich√© or predictable in any way. Most recommended. <br /> <br /> A previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 to the movie and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances - I totally agree ...
