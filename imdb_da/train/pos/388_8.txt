...and I love it. Lots of special effects, and for a movie that is not made on the mega budget, this movie really does a great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of those guys who didn't understand the story at all, but it was still a good flick to see. It is clearly up to the standards that exceed Bored of the Rings and, like movies like Harry Potter. As it says a lot to a movie again, made in a fraction of the budget for these international hits. One thing I really love about this movie is that it extends the envelope with adventure movies coming out of Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. Production quality is in contrast to what is seen by HK for fantasy action movies, and the play is amazing. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies coming out of Hong Kong, this is The Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong fantasy film, and I hope they will continue to work in this area until they surpass Hollywood Adventure Movies . <br /> <br /> Just amazing.
