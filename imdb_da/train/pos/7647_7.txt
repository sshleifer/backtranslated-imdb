Okay, so it borrows a bit from "It's a wonderful life," but it was 44 years before this movie, so why not a new trial. Belushi has a 35 year old birthday. He didn't get his Wheaties, his coffee and lost his job. Capper is when his self-described "big blue piece of sh **" car breaks down at the end of the day. He leads into an empty rod to demand a tow. While waiting, he is recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the child who lost the city's championship basketball game 20 years earlier. This makes him think about how life would have been if he had won the game. He finds out when Caine serves a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion, the prom queen (Russo) as his wife and makes him president of the sports company he has been preserved from. Caine later reveals himself as the one responsible for this change, but Belushi is not quite on board. He never adapts completely, and in a plot development that does not kill the movie but still strange, he tries to court his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, now married to someone else. The good thing is that they don't spend too much time on it, as they in principle rip off "Ghost," with Belushi, who constantly tells Hamilton things she could only know. It also brings into a hokey dramatic element that two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows, the new wife Russo and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the movie are the little long start and the funniest end. Also good work from the large and recognizable cast, which Belushi is very comfortable, very attractive ladies selected, and Caine is quite easy to go as a title guy. Strangely, this was Belushi's second movie from 1990, which was about getting an alternative lifestyle of wealth found in "Business Care". Although similar, both films are at the same level of grin. So check this out for a fun exploration of "what if?"
