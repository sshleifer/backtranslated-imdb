from a NASCAR galaxy like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many racing cars from 1983. Even hard is the racing scenes not so realistic. But I have to admit that I haven't seen any race before 1995, because before that time they didn't show any NASCAR races in Germany) from a Burt Reynolds tab's point of view as I am, the movie is pretty much what we are used to seeing from Reynolds in the 80s: Off the wheel of a fast car, like in his Bandit Movies. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must-see. If you only love one of these 2 things, I also recommend seeing it. If you don't like either NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, still give it a try, but remember, this movie was far from winning an Oscar Academy Award. That is the typical humor of the 80s. If you like movies like Cannonball Film and Police Academy, you will also like it.
