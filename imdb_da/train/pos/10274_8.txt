SPOILERS This is a poignant film about the greats. But who is conning who here? When will the hunter be swapped? This gritty, dark film is slowly moving and seductive. It pulls you in and pulls you down into the magnificent garden road, just to weigh you as you think you are safe. It has a fast-paced script with good acting (at least from the leaders). I didn't notice the background music, but it never became devastating, so it must have been done right. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I don't usually go for this genre, but this one sucked me in and kept him connected to the end.
