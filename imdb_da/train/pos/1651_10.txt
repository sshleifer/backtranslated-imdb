I saw this presentation at PBS in the United States when it was originally shipped in 1988 (?). Provided the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought the first edition of all three books last year. Since then I have searched for the series on internet movie sites. Today I found this site. I will give up the search. <br /> <br /> I also want to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After purchasing the DVDs, I would read each book, then see the episodes for that book. That's what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> Anyone have any suggestions for good books or book series that became very good TV miniseries - or movie series - now available on DVD?
