Hard to believe perhaps, but this film was condemned as immoral from more pulpits than any other movie produced before the introduction of the bluenose Hayes code. Yes, in fact, the priests said their flocks that everyone who went to watch this movie committed a deadly sin. <br /> <br /> I'm not making up. They had several reasons as follows: <br /> <br /> Element: Jane likes sex. She and Tarzan wake up one morning in their wooden deck. She stretches sensuously, and with a cap-like look she says "Tarzan, you've been a bad boy!" So they have not only had sex, they have had kinky sex! A few years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) were not supposed to be depicted as sex. <br /> <br /> Point: Jane prefers a guiltless, clever and resourceful, wild (Tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine-to-five man (Holt). When Holt first wakes her up with a beautiful dress from London, she wavers a little; When Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both believe he is dead, she wavers a lot. But when she realizes that her husband is very alive, the attraction of civilization disappears for her. And why not? Tarzan's and Jane's relationships are uniform: he lacks the "civilized" uncertainty that forces him to assert himself as "his wife's head". To start, he lacks many more "civilized" hangups, such as jealousy. When Holt and his companion arrive, Tarzan warmly welcomes them and knows that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt gets her up in a London dress and slowly dances with her into a portable phonograph, Tarzan falls out of a tree and pulls her knife. Jealous? Nix. He's only careful with the strange music machine, since he has never seen one before. When explained, he is cool. <br /> <br /> Item: Civilized Holt is dirty mind. Savage Tarzan is innocent sexy. When Jane slides into Holt's lamplit tent, Holt goes out and looks at the silhouette when she changes into fancy dress. In contrast, when Tarzan suddenly pulls off the dress, kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her follows the most tastefully erotic naked scene in all cinemas: the couple spends five minutes in a lovely water ball. filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the film's release, but the nude version is restored in the now available video.) And when Jane comes up and the cheetah steals the chimpanzee's dress just for a teasing, Jane makes clear that her irritation is only due to the presence of "civilized" men and their hangups. Where is the "universal rebellion" so dear to the hearts of the seminars? Nothing is where. Another reason why it hung up considered this film as sinful. <br /> <br /> Element: The notion that man is the crown of creation and animals here only for men and comfort, takes a serious blow. Holt and his friend want to be guided to "elephant cemetery" so they can scoop up ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to lead them to the cemetery. You read, think "Fed chance!" And you're right. He's shocked. He exclaims "Elephants sleep!" which for him explains everything. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings, which the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Point: Jane, the former civilized woman, is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and friend blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. It is Jane who keeps her cool. While the boys panic, she takes responsibility, books orders on them and passes the rifles. <br /> <br /> Element: Jane's costume is a kind of poncho with nothing underneath. (The original idea was that she should be topless, with leaf artistic blocking of her nipples, which is actually the case in a short scene.) Finally, several men complained on the cloth because the film was called "Tarzan and his friend" rather than "Tarzan and his wife". No comment! Of course, Tarzan, who has been healed by his monkey friends, rescued, routed the white hunters and induced the elephants and the African carriers to turn ivory they stole to the sacred place from which it came. The end. <br /> <br /> So there you have it. A completely subversive movie. Like any other movie about complex and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which constituted such a floating genre in the early 30s and brought to such an abrupt end by adoption of the Hays code. <br /> <br /> Joie de vivre of this movie is best expressed by Jane's soprano version of the famous Tarzan Scream. A nice touch, which unfortunately was left in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
