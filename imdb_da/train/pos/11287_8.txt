As noted by other reviewers, this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the movie as it feels like a fairly accurate portrayal of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exhibition is needed so we know why Harry will go back in the jungle. In addition, the film's beginning contains one of the most exciting and frightening chase sequences ever made. This happens when Harry's safari group fights a strain of cannibals. The precursor production values ​​provide a lot of realism that really shows the dreadful dangers that awaited Europeans entering the jungle. The film also offers, perhaps, of course, an accurate account of how terribly the native Africans treated by their white employers. In addition, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some beautiful sets and two chetas! Not to miss an adventure classic.
