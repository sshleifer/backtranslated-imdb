Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie is after Batman: Dead End, which just helps stimulate our taste buds and let us have more! This is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even more difficult this is a fan film of some sort. Attention to detail, character and action is unthinkable real. Although this is a limited resource production, it is ashamed of large budgeted, star cast, hyped productions "other" superhero-related films. Here the most important and supportive characters work and look like they are real people. Finally a Superman who actually looks "super" and looks like the right thing! Batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubbery, ripped body arms to hide scary physics for overpaid non-delivering actors. I just want some sensible Warner Bros. exec gives OK to produce a full length fit of this jewel. I don't care if it goes to theaters or just to DVD, I will never get tired of seeing it. Just the plot itself is worth my hard-earned dough for this. Hope the "bigwigs" in Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a really well-produced superhero film should look like. No more Batman & Robin fiasco or Hulk, Daredevil etc. Learn from these little time directors and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero of the movie just to make it "bomb" in theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
