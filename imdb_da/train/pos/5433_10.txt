This movie is one of my favorites all the time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy rolled up in one. The final battle scene, which continues to this day, gives me chills and the end always leaves me in tears. If you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend it.
