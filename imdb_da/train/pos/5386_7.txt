This film is one that played really well back in 1932 and would probably not work so well today because it styles it a bit old-fashioned and constructed. But if you are the kind of person like me who loves older Hollywood movies, you cut the movie a bit limp and can enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is put in a section for problem pregnancies. In this great room, about half a dozen beds are where women are waiting to give birth - but doctors are concerned about possible complications (yikes - such a room would really traumatize mothers!). And as an episode of "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", each mother has her own special story. With so many rather extreme and crazy stories, you should suspend disbelief. I could and enjoyed the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Here are a few of the stories: One involves a father. You cannot see the mother, but he is a very, very nervous father, and it is included in comic relief. But he was wonderful here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is sent to the hospital from prison - she apparently killed an awful guy. You don't know exactly what happened, but you assume he was trying to force her on! Yet she got a 20 year sentence - and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a horrible person. She has the mother's instincts from a hamster - a real, really bad and alcoholic hamster! She is pretty funny and worth watching through most of the movie. I loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin and getting sad when she learned she can't make money selling her twins !! Most recently in the film, she has a typical Hollywood change of heart that should touch. I found it constructed. There is a woman who has given birth to a stillborn baby. Amazingly afterwards, they put the lady back in the same department as the women waiting to give birth! A crazy woman whom you assumed lost a baby some time ago wanders down from the psychiatric unit. She insists she has a baby. Later she flies again and actually takes one of the kids! <br /> <br /> There are most stories than this, but the ones I mentioned are the most important. That said, it's a kind of soap opera and is very entertaining - and quite sad in the case of several of the stories. The end is especially heartbreaking and exceptionally well done. There were a couple of particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as chief caregivers. All in all, a very good movie - and I have no idea why they felt they should reuse the film just a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
