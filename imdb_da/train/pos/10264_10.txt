Just watched the movie for the third time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest threw as much as before. It just gets better and better. Just wonder at the carefully measured way of speaking, the slow conscious action, everything is exactly in place. Really one of the great and certainly my all-time favorite !!!
