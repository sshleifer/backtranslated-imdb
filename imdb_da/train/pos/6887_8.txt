This is a unique and bold movie. It is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performance. <br /> <br /> I love executives who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions and dig beneath the surface. Of the nature of the film, it almost requires that the viewer also looks inward. It can take something to do this. I can see how some nearby people might find this rather disturbing. But I found it thoughtful, much more than just entertainment. Bret Carr is really an original movie maker with vision. I'm curious to see what he wants to do next. <br /> <br /> See him.
