"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked the first time I saw it. I really liked the second time. I loved it the third time. Now it is one of my favorites all the time. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but really good. The film offers very warm humor. the story goes on in an Italian neighborhood in old school in nyc Cher looking for love is fun to see. This film is by far the best work Nicholas Cage has done on film. The old man's character is amazing. He turns on the screen without saying a word. The scene with their dogs howling in the moon was amazing. But perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is a scene where the protagonists have it in addition to a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Extraordinary direction and wrapping.
