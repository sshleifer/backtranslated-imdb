I was very happy to go see a "Milanese" movie shoot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood correctly and fortunately printed in a film the Filipino philosophy. <br /> <br /> Film tells the story of a standard career-melanic couple starting from "birth" to death. The birth wedding is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is difficult in the "bones" of Milan, and after the sweets became old and harder, and finally the product: a child who, instead of strengthening the mating relationship, weakens it, because "the selfish effect" typical of a present "metropolis" personality. The advertising environment with all the "creative" under stress atmosphere helps get well involved in the plot. We lose our life values, and it is well and deeply reflected in this fine and sharp film by senza pelle's director. <br /> <br /> The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca is good and well-characterized and a positive surprise, an unexpectedly good Fabio Volo, well-known by the "trash" television series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
