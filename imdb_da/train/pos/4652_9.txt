I think this movie is well done and realistic. I'm used to watching Hollywood action movies, and using it as a standard to judge this movie, you have to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what lifts it over the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish military at all, and therefore cannot point out any errors in their way. But as I have seen "making of" extra, I am convinced that much has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie I would recommend to others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie.
