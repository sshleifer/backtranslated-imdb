I think many people just wrote it as another of Tom Cruise's strange movie (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many said it was strange; It wasn't. It was different and confusing but not strange. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it makes sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That is the point. This is where the so-called "weirdness" who turned critics away came in. If they had bothered to "open their eyes" as the original Spanish film from 1997, they would have seen it. And if there is not enough reason to see it, watch it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; He uses it to put "feel" - the infamous element that many movies lack. With songs like The Beach Boys 'Good Vibrations' playing on the film's dramatic and emotional climax, he creates a creepy but astonishing "real" feeling. A wonderful movie, in its script, music, acting and pictures, Vanilla Sky is unfortunately a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide to become intelligent. Excellent: A +
