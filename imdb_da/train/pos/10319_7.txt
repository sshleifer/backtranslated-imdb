Having read many of the other reviews for this movie on IMDb, there seems to be a consensus among purists that this film is nothing like the books it builds on. At this point I cannot comment that I have never read any of the protagonist's adventures before. But what I can say with certainty is that it finds me that many of the reviewers mentioned must have undergone a humorous bypass; Let's be honest here - this movie is just so fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. so I have to admit the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character / s, but let's put this into a clear perspective ?? .. do the same individuals who stumble upon this movie also the fact that the classic 1960s Batman series does not remain true to the original DC cartoon character? Or maybe there are still concerns in the same people that the 1980 movie version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series? The point is, yes, this movie is an incredible camp, but it's just its charm! Formerly Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and carries more than one passerby resemblance to Gary Busey to start!) And is backed by a great supporting spirit, who all seem to have a ball with their respective roles. Also look for a very short but very welcoming look of the horror movie favorite Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Too many to choose from, but check out the cozy facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas to ordering coke, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the movie, where Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilizing various martial arts disciplines marked on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> It's simply said that the movie doesn't take itself seriously and is even more fun. Fun from start to finish! (and you will sing John Phillip Sousa custom theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)
