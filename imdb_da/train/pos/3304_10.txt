This film is one of the very few Indian films that would never fade away with the passage of time, nor will its spelling appeal reduce, although the Indian cinema turns into the abyss of artificially stoked pop culture while drilling-oriented extras are improving PT style movie songs. <br /> <br /> The camera tells Josef Werching's outstanding skills, highlighting the film's monumental and biographical reach in its entirety. Gone are the days of a big cinema, as each scene had to be cut many times and readings were taken before the completion of it, while careful attention was paid to the design and editing of the scenes. Some of his exciting scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity, as the example when Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an approval for Nikah (Marriage Bond) and climbs down the hill while running amok in traumatized frenzy. Currently, Raj Kumar follows her, and a strong storm wind blew Kumari's veil and on Kumar's legs ....... Kamal Amrohi must always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema's story to try to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years. He had to cope with movie footage of some of the vital songs without Meena's close ups, because the lead star Meena Kumari was terminally ill and fought for her life in early 1971.
