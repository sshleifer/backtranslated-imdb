A quiet, sweet and beutifully nostalgic film about how to confront old friends and surroundings from your youth with all the memories and present-day problems and sorrows with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Mischief, nightly refrigerator and all the other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience it again, as the old campmaster now retires and wants to meet the children from the camps' golden years. Everyone is now in their thirties and mid-career.
