This movie has great stars in their previous years: Ingor Stevens never looked more beautiful; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte who was in conflict with his piracy and wanted to keep neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a good job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stupid. It is really a good flick for students to learn that part of our story, and it shows that every happy ending does NOT include those lovers who come together - sometimes it is happier that they sail away and find partners with similar background that will understand them better in the long run. I have seen it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and even though it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
