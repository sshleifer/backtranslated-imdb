I'm looking at most movies that Nick Mancuso is in because I honestly love the guy even though he is age, he is typically thrown as baddie (long-term fans should note that for some reason he is blonde in this flick). It's a fairly well-known movie in terms of plot (but then most movies are not very original these days), but Rick Roberts appeals as the imperfect man, Martha MacIsaac is as appealing as her daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does a great deal work if it was her goal, to be angry and sometimes rather difficult to like. Nick still has it to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot is going on off-screen-like motivation, past behavior, good times and bad times - and things that seem apparent to the characters never make it to the audience (ie me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the category "but what about ..." and generally I cannot say that I cared much about any of the characters. That said, it was what it was - a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
