I agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content "everyday madness", but would like to specify that: "Dog days" is about how women are treated in (a male) society. The episodes we see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner see and act as his previous wife had, treating her as a doll that should seem "worth wearing" the former dress on. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he is a (violent) master. In addition, we find a slightly younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and instead of being really envious of her affairs even makes friendship with her competitor (s). A young adult man makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really worried about being beautiful enough for him - that she should be the jewelry at his side and follow his narrow set of labels. Finally, there is a man at the end of the fifties who calculates his own benefit, delivers a simple-minded woman to a furious client who - as her guilty of scratching her car - naturally strikes her up. To complete the examples, we find the man's friend in the "master-slave" fight - after abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former "for her sake" because she must get rid of her partner and take her as her new "master ". Underneath this, the inhabitants of the newly built neighborhood, where the action takes place, rests under the burning summer sun - completely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic depiction of the archaic structures still prevailing in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool to teach even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization.
