First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, meaning you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have seen most other movies. Secondly, do this. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrible but always powerful images. Cats ride in and drink out of a water elephant, a circus with a bird that has eaten the sky, and pigs eat their own fried meat - that's just the beginning. The scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that requires resumption. In addition, the DVD contains a fantastic director's comment which, in view of the extremely idle dialogue, only amplifies the view. The commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also gives invaluable quotes on the design of cat soup, as follows: "Well, the artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself so it's hard to say why it turned out like it did "(it's a bad rewrite by the way). The sound throughout the film is also very high quality, very precise and very humorous. All in all, the absolute minimum experience must be experienced as follows: <br /> <br /> First view: Watch the DVD without comment. Other view: View the DVD with the comment. Third View: Rewatch without comment. <br /> <br /> However, once you have seen it three times, you will not stop there ...
