Be lucky enough to be an extra in this amazing movie and loved every minute of the movie. Went to prizes in London and had a good conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon who made my wife. Great after party too. So a couple of weeks later had a trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant movie it deserves to be up there with all the great biker movies. Now we have DVD Sue my wife can't get enough of it nor the kids. Get a little stick from the club, which seems to me to be a movie star now, oh well, you can only dream. I think they're just jealous. The only downside to the first part of the movie was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow-up so keep me updated Jon. Danny Beck
