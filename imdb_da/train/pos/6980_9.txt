I have to admit that I was one of those skeptics who prematurely condemned this show before there was relatively little information about it. I stated that it would be a cheap spin-off run by Ronald D. Moore who used the retcon wing. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent impression of the viewers. Availability is great! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the basics, which are focused on the development of the Cylons before the first war. (58 years before BSG pilot's events). The pilot also offers the opportunity for beginners who clearly present their plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not understand: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with an in-depth, cerebral drama characterized by provocative, bold and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting maintains BSG's standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply amazing. Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos's depiction of William, gives a wonderful glimpse of Wilhelm's heroic father. Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If the pilot's quality is an indication of what has yet to come, RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG's legacy of the former -Edit television programming with another masterfully crafted television masterpiece.
