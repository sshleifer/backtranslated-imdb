While I suppose this movie could make the rap be Anti-Vietnam while I watched it, I didn't feel that was the case, as much as the movie was simply an honest look at the perspective of the young guys. educated for a war that the public did not support .... it showed their fears, their desperation, their drive ... all out in the open, naked. As a soldier, many of the themes rang right for me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp. All in all, even though it was shot on a very small budget, this film looks good, is very well-composed and has excellent acting and management. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell movie. 10.10
