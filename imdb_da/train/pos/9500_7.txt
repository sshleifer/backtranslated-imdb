I watched this movie on TV and fascinated by Jennifer McComb's beauty. It was a nice movie and you can see it for Africa's beauty and of course Mccomb. At that time, I was thrilled to watch this movie and from then on I am trying for the VCD of this movie, but I can't find it. Big African lions make appearance int his movie and we will be spelled just by the size of these animals and the grace of them. All parts of the audience can watch this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving McComb strengthen the parents' guidance for this movie. It's an enjoyable holiday movie for everyone.
