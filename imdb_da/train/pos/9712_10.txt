Another review looked like this troupe for a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also appropriate. Another review of the differences between comedy, we enjoy non-critical and black comedy, also worth considering. <br /> <br /> See it all, all three series. At the end, all characters are tied up, and the puzzles fall into place as well as a Douglas Adams novel. Detail and intricacies are staggering. Thoroughly postmodern. Terrible fun and outrageous tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skins or lacking in objectivity. Thought-provoking. At once literal, figurative and surreal in disturbing ways. The hardest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And very possibly the most wonderful thing I will ever see.
