Clint Eastwood has certainly produced better movies than this, but it doesn't scare him. Dirty Harry catches everyone's attention, and unless you want to see romance, there's no reason you don't like him. He is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thought, is perfect because he gets the ball straight through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care. From what I've seen in movies where Eastwood works, the character of the lead always captures the audience. In White Hunter Black Heart he is the crazy instructor, in "In the Fire Line" he is "Old" un ", while here is" almost "jobless with his job, that is, he does work for himself, does not care with a curse on his superiors, practically sending him out for a holiday. <br /> <br /> Based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all "non-sensible" movie watchers. Away from his central plot, however, what makes it a little worse than Eastwood's better movies is that, although the character of the lead role is captivating, the plot isn't because it's too obvious from the start. makes you sit in a place without moving, too many people are far dirtier than Dirty Harry.
