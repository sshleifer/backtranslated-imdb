My rating: 8/10 <br /> I like a lot of this movie. Comparing today's brainless movie (just action and special effet and no news about ideas), "Soylent Green" is asking for something that does not exist today: Thinking. It would not be a big surprise one day a human eating "cookies" created with the human body. With all that happens on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to everyone, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Sure this movie is getting a little age, but the idea behind the movie is actually again. Rich in Paradise, others in hell. Good luck today are the tv and idiocy as "Reality Show". TV is a good wash brain. It is a pity to see that human intelligence has no progress as technologies. Since you write everything stop. <br /> <br /> If you like reality shows, this movie is not for you. If you think all politicians are the same too. If you don't like asking yourself, the question of now and the future, never take this movie out.
