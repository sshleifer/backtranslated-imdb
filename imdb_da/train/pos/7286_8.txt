I had a good time watching this picture and was surprised by its more erudite features. First, the film is undoubtedly cheaply produced with cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific props. The play ranges from very poor (the two strippers), hardly professionals (Herb Evers as the leading man), Gothic overstatement (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) to the first movement with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim living her will for the benefit of science and her fianc√© lustful passions. However, the script is very good, and the dialogue is great for a movie of this ilk. Problems abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thought film in many ways. But don't be fooled by its real intention. It is an insidious story of a man obsessed with his medical science ability who wants to merge his dead boyfriend with the perfect body, creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is the scissors music, which resonates strongly every time the doctor scores the city for female beauties.
