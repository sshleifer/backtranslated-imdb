Anyone who finds this movie boring is a hopeless bone head that has to stick to billiards and romantic comedies. This movie is nit and has no dull moment. Why? Because it consists largely of an intelligent dialogue between real people in times of crisis and details of their efforts to survive that crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! That's what characterizes almost all Rohmer's movies, and that's why many people don't like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to search movies like this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky". Well, he's, but for me it's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also talky. Is there a talkie game than "Hamlet?" When the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values, there must necessarily be a discussion of these ideas and values, which is largely about this film. Aristocracy and noble births vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends who are set to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who holds that life is not so nice or even despicable. (Someone ever hears about Dostoyevsky or "Crime and Punishment?") This is about this movie. <br /> <br /> The two leaders in this movie are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as his second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this ripping movie. It may be the last movie of this screen saver.
