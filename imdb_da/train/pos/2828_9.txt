After tracking it for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing because I am one of those who die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so-called hot movie of Goro. But I couldn't believe that Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he is in crisis that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they found the perfect person to look embarrassed, dissatisfied and half depressed most. Man, I still can't believe he made this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many parts didn't think he really made such a movie .... hahahaha .... But I'm glad to have seen it. Thank God he grew up ...
