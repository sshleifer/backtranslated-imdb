I first saw this movie on some movie channels (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, promo for it caught my eye and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well straight out of the bat, I knew it was good (WARNING!) And I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth seeing over and over again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You have to love the satire of rap groups (of course NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and humor from the three members of the NWH. Who can forget about Tone Deaf scratching his ass? It's too bad that this movie didn't get the credit it deserved when it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion it's a much better movie. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll watch and laugh with this movie for a long time. If you are not in or do not like 'rap', you will enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
