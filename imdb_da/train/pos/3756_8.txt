Made only ten years after the actual events, and put in the bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's films are quite poignant. The series of sulfur-containing deaths awaiting the perpetrators of World War II. Have not seen this for over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The signs seem to be waiting to be walled up in their hole. Searing bit of dialogue between two generals: "does God exist?" "If he did, we wouldn't." Shame this is no longer available for show or purchase because it would be interesting to watch and compare this movie with the documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (also "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz .
