Perfectly cast for a couple of people's drama. Simon is dead but somehow stays from outside. What he had seen in the form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of death he had seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive, but fails to decide to follow him after his final death. Very nourishing and moving, deeply psychological, but a little slow and somewhere boring.
