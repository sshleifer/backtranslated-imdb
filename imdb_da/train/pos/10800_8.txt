This movie is far better than the original The Jerk. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes quirky humor. We have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from Monty Python. Card game with hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The stage at the dining table and his taste for turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographed and staged. While I like Steve Martin, he thought he was trying hard. The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone. The Jerk Too is family-friendly as opposed to the original The Jerk.
