Magicians are a wonderful journey from start to finish, thanks in large part to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles for decades. As a really good movie, it is a journey where the theme is redemption and the result of dreaming. I can't believe this movie is so hard to find - I wanted to buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but haven't yet found an outlet.
