I caught this on the dish last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adoption of our 2 children). I can't put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie, except to see "bad" trip "good" and "good" trip "half bad". I liked the look Ben Chaplin has throughout the movie. Like "I can't believe it happens to me" whether it's good or bad, the same look (and it works). Great ending. 10.7. Rent it or take it on the dish as I did.
