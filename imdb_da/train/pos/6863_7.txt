A great thrill movie with fantastic slow camera work that adds to the drama makes it a great experience to see and enjoy. CEO Brian de Palma makes a super Hitchcock imitation (many called it a "ripoff") with this movie, and the 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera work (and more scenes with people hiding on each page lost on formatted TV tapes). The back of the movie, at least to anyone who has a kind of moral standard, is the general gossip of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking with a rather long shower scene by Angie Dickinson, quite explicit, even 25 years after the release. The movie has several erotic scenes in it like Dickinson (if it really is her close up) and Nancy Allen is not shy about showing their bodies. There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and No bad language before Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting, and although it's clear who the killer is, it's still very good excitement and fun to look all the way, especially for men and the naked women.
