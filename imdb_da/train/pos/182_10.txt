If you are uninitiated to the Gundam world, this is a great place to start. If you're burned out on Star Wars or Star Trek, here's a compelling, realistic sci-fi series that you can be immersed in. Not the simplistic boy-saving world-fighting robot story you might have expected, but rather a complex, emotionally convincing space war drama where the line between the "good" and "bad" guys is definitely less than clear. Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends. During this series, Al befriends an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al teaches some hard lessons about the reality of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifices. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series with its cool mecha designs that involved history and similar characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF anime, or to those who think anime is just stupid or sexy entertainment.
