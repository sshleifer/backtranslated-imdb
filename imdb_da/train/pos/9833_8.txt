A terrorist attempt to steal a top secret biological weapon, and trying to escape, he is infected when the case containing the lethal agent is compromised. Soldiers are able to retrieve the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he tries to hide. They eventually make it where he hides and "cleans" the hotel and its residents. Unfortunately they discard their body by cremation, and if you have seen the Return of the Living Dead, you know what happens next time. Zombi 3 has been widely searched by both critics and zombie fans as a complete mess on a movie. Although it is a fair assessment, it is not without the highest. First, it has lots of bloody deaths to keep gorehounds happy. There is an abundance of zombies that seem to come from all sorts of places. They are in the water, the house beams, hiding in trees, and for some reason they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush, only to get out to attack as the hero tries to escape. There is even a flying zombie head hiding inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it, as the scene alone makes Zombi 3 required IMO viewing. It may have some horrible edits and some very dubious actions, especially from the doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it's great to sit back and watch a movie that requires nothing more than your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 fits the bill and then some. It's even more enjoyable if you open a few beers and see it with some like-minded friends. I give it an 8/10, just because of sheer pleasure.
