Marvelous James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. What makes this historic movie dealing with the FBI so good is the family element involved in a 35-year career depicted by Stewart in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film shows a story of the great investigative body. It deals with airplane bomb plots, kills of Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gains, combat organized crime, Nazis and Communists in that order. The human element is never far behind when Stewart is at Vera Miles. They travel 3 children while Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart goes on the job. <br /> <br /> Look for a short but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967's "The Graduate." The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly brought the FBI to each other. True, this could be seen as right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's real Republican views, but it is well done, historically informative, and the view of the family as well depicted.
