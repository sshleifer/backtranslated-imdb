"Hat of a Minute" is a ghostly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller who takes you on a journey through the nightmare, which is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and outstanding filmmaking make this movie a "must see" for any movie room or horror fan. The reality of the story and the human side of Eric distinguishes this film from other psychic killers. Some shout outs to the film's producer, Bruce Campbell, and to the movie "The Evil Dead" adds a little humor to anyone who knows the genre.
