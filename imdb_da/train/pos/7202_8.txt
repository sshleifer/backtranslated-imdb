Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years before), "Deathtrap" was the first time I ever saw two men passionately kissing on the screen and, frankly, I was shocked. I understood it about the plot, and it didn't really disturb my feelings (not much), but it was the first time I ever saw it in a "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a gutsy movement for his time and took the courage to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen may have taken its step with "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this much earlier incarnation.
