I did not live in the 60s, so I cannot guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period, but it is certainly a moving and satisfying experience. There are some excellent performances, especially by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who plays brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has many times ignored many, gives a heartfelt performance as their strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values ​​when one of his sons prides himself on going to Vietnam, but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all, this is a strong and hearty movie, which I hope everyone gets a chance to experience.
