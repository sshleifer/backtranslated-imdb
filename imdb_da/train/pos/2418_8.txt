One of John's finest, Eugene Levy is also great in this, just wish the studio would find out that this should be on DVD, I have it on videotape but feel this movie deserves DVD (and extras would be great) Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) shit is so much fun as the whole movie, including the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are amazing, this movie never looks on TV, but it loses most of it is hilarious when it is edited to broadcast tv, if you can find the video, i suggest you buy it (ebay is a great place to find a copy). I will keep my VHS until one day, we'll see it on DVD. There are so many good movies out there that have still not been released to DVD and this is one of them.
