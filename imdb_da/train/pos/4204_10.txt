And anyone who sees this movie will agree. This movie was directed in the days when plot, character credibility and theme actually matter. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in the top form as informant "Moe" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, which acts as a stool pigeon to the NYC police. The only other movie I've seen Peters is "Niagara" and she certainly shows her ability here, complete with the Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately threatening as an anti-hero who must distinguish what the right thing is, despite his need for cash. The photography is brilliant. Neon, the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the right thing!) Harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transitory. Excellent use is made of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; the many flavors and eating places in the city are addressed here; The political climate in time is a ghost base. 10/10.
