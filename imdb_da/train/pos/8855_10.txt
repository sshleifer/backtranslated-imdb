Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still played! Some years ago, he shot "Find Me Guilty", a proof of all that Vin Diesel can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired from this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But he still goes strong, his next movie is already announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is amazing, their performance top notch. The small nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or situations that develop throughout the film are just amazing. The film's (time) structure, which keeps your toes constantly, blends timelines so smoothly that editing works natural / flawless. The story is elevated with it, but even in a "normal" time structure, it would have been at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! : O)
