If you want thoughtless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, then this show is for you! <br /> <br /> The term Dark Angel is nothing new (in fact, there is controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book), but I spend the whole hour watching it every Tuesday from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba's smoking and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. The battle scenes are getting better, but the dialogue between Original Cindy and Max must be a bit better (the snake sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan can ask for, but if you're looking for hard-hit award-winning drama, see "The West Wing" or something.
