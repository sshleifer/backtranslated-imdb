Woody Allen's second movie seen in London. Tha Tarot Card killer kills prostitutes in London. The hopeful journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he can be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to romanticize him, but quickly falls in love. She is helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like this better than last year's overrated "Match Point". It was shorter and moved much faster. The reason is old but I was entertained and it kept me guessing at the end. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with a couple of very good comic lines (everything from Allen of course). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's far better than its worst. <br /> <br /> The action is mostly very good. Allen is bad, but he has played this character a million times before, and it has become tedious. But Johansson and Jackman are just fantastic - they look fantastic and give two very appealing credible performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) is working on their sex appeal - there is an order where they are both in their swimsuits to show their fine body. The only real debit is that Allen still seems to be unsure of how to shoot London. He is not as free as he was at "Match Point" himself - maybe he just gets better while he goes together. Worth seeing. I give it a 8.
