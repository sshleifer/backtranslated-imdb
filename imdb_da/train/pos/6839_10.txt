In what must be one of the most blood-free films ever, a transvestite man in New York murder and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. You can see how Brian DePalma has some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and things. Michael Caine plays a most thought-provoking character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a boring rich woman with a poor hairdresser. Keith Gordon (who later stood in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you can't really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you can never know who you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
