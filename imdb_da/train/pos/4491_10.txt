I love this movie 'Spring and Port Wine'. I was born in Leigh, a town about 7 miles away from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My workplace was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bike, but by car when I had advice it. The movie brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who almost always broke, but who would always help you if they could. The Fred Dibnah was around the corner from Bromwich St., where my bed was. If you could not see the movie when it was first released, you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap like Coronation St and I agree that it is a soap, but then it was called 'Kitchen Laundry Drama! ' Watch this movie for the talented cast, which soon became house names from frequent roles on television, I mainly look at the shots at the site and the felt good factor that people are poor but happy!
