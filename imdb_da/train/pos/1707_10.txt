This movie is not for everyone. You are either bright enough to get "it" or you are not. Fans of sci-fi movies that do not take themselves seriously for sure will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie to those who appreciate spoofs and parodies. All I have recommended this movie to have had it. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks movie, you will probably enjoy it. Voice characterizations are performed in a heavy-in-kind fashion, and the liner fly fast and furious.
