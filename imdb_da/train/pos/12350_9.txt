I'm not sure how I missed this when it first came out, but I'm happy to have finally seen it. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of Japan's samurai code. <br /> <br /> It's unique Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before being able to lead this film, his adaptation of the manuscript is shown. His views on the Japanese world and the caste system are known and shed light on how these systems interact with each other. The characters can rotate around each other, but the tossing system remains intact when each character returns to the world they belong to. On a different road with a man who is part of her throwing system ... least of the lows. Many are rewarding the samurai's world over everyone else, but it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint. Samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak, while the classless lovers turn out to be honorable. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves a higher rating. It is a tale of women's survival in feudal Japan. During this time frame, men were considered to be the survivors. They were strong, while women were considered just mindless and weak. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they needed to survive and how their strength allowed the Japanese culture to continue as it has. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The Sea is Watching" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not fan. It's a nice, stylish and soul-bearing movie, and one to be worthy of any movie collection.
