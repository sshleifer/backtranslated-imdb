in a not so conventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a toddler and I remembered it recently and thought to look it up. While many of the details are no longer clear in my mind, the overall feeling has been that the film stuck to me over the years. If the parents feel that their children can cope with mature and sometimes violent themes, then I strongly recommend this movie. It taught me a lot about life and death and brought me a lot of emotions. To this day, it's one of my favorite movies.
