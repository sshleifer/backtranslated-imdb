I just saw The St Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was George Sander's first appearance as Saint, replacing Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this one, Saint sends to San Francisco to investigate a shooting in a nightclub. With the help of his acquaintance Inspector Fernack, who has come down from New York, they help a daughter to a crime chief. <br /> <br /> Joining Sanders in the cast is Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> Not a bad Saint movie. Worth to see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
