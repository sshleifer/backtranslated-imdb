Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday night drama shown for a long time. I ask the author to write a long series and air it at lifetime, every time. Each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the reason true. However, the film must continue for a long time. I would love to see Bianca and Jake's children grow up and play a major role in the movie with the new grandparents planning for their educational future. Also bring kathy back to see her niece and help promote her life. It was great to see grandparents preparing their problems, but the family business had to be restored to work status and let us see how Jake and Bianca survive through the marriage several years.
