I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The film is diamond among bullets in this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without errors. This movie should have made them stars. Shame on the studio not to put everything they had behind this movie. It could easily have been a franchise. Publishing on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this movie. Look for it in your TV guide, and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Make yourself another service - read the book (same title). It will blow you away. Times have changed dramatically since these days, or at least we think they have.
