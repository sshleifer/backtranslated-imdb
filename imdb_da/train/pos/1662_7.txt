The film of Artemisia can be considered treason or as a genuine artistic license. <br /> <br /> In a documented story, Artemisia Gentileschi was exposed to the thumb and still confirmed that she was ruthless as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have blessed confirmed. <br /> <br /> In the film, under another torture, she refused to condemn her lover / violator. How can a movie differ so much from the history received, but still inform the human heart? The answer is not that hard to find. In the film, the director and cast had filled a gap in historical record, with the power of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This led to a conclusion that differs from the post. <br /> <br /> So be it. I find _both_ the record and the movie to be convincing. <br /> <br /> In both the film and (it seems) in history, Artemisia was a painter before anything else. <br /> <br /> For the vision framed in a sic film composition, I'm really grateful. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a movie that forced my eyes. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
