I have to give how she moves an almost perfect rating because the content is really amazing. As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie has found itself in IMDB's bottom 100 list! It's totally ridiculous! Other movies - especially those who share the dance theme - can't keep that light on the combination of top-notch, credible actors, and great dance routines. <br /> <br /> From the beginning Ending the underlying story (it's not just about winning a competition) is very easy to dive into and surprisingly realistic. None of the protagonists of this is two-dimensional in any way, and at the end of the movie it is very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And even if you're not the crying type, you might get a little grinning eyes before the credits.) I definitely recommend this movie to dance lovers and even more to those who appreciate an exciting and well-behaved story. How she moves is not perfect of course (which movie is?), But it certainly is a cut of films that use beautiful faces to hide a half-baked plot and / or missing material. The actors and the settings of this movie provide a very realistic ride that is as exciting as the dancers' amazing talent!
