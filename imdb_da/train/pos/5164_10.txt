I attended Camp Chesapeake. It was the head of the Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar type of summer camp with cabins. It was created by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and later became Junior, Senior Advisor and later Waterfront Director. If the camp had continued, I would have done something within my power to become a camp. Alas decided YMCA's power to close the camp and sell it to the state MD. I visited the former camp a few years later by boat and was appalled by the neglect of the state MD and natural destruction of mother nature. The 350 acre site earned so many with all the benefits of contact with nature's offerings. A black man named Curtis Ford, and his family were residents and residents of the property. Sir. Curtis was my friend and mentor I idolized his every being. Even when he couldn't swim, he was a jellyfish. If I asked him where the fish contributed, he would point out the place and I wanted a ball. Ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me for eternity.
