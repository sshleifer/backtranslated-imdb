Gandhi, the Great: Greatness of the world is associated with people like Alexanader the Great, Ashoka the Great, for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans. Gandhi is great for actually not being a big, but being more human, because I always think to bring mankind into us, where greatness is to be human lies. Gandhi was a human being with mankind, and one who sought after mankind ready to sacrifice in the struggle for humanity, but not his enemies. Now let me move to the movie list. About Gandhi My Father: <br /> Gandhi My father is a movie, not about Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi. By telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest people to walk this earth, the director manages to portray the story. The film succeeds in telling the story of a deceptive son of a father who leads a nation to greatness. The film is described as a criticism of Gandhi's failure as a father to his son, I'd rather say it is a victim Gandhi had made as a son's father to do justice as a national father. <br /> <br /> I want the essence of this movie to prevail not only in India, Gandhian country but through the hearts of all the world's peoples. <br /> <br /> Gandhi the true Human. Jaihind.
