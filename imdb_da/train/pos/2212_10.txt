E! TV is a good channel and Talk Soup is so fun, in a moment you can see the episodes change. We want more fun writings by best writer ever Stan Evans. The actor Saint of the mindless masses ... He is a truly talented, talented writer, actor, cartoon, producer, director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole loved him, but he was not a million billionaires, so he left him a billionaire. Many superstars wanted to make films with actor Stan Evans, who has a "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable} play. He was going to make many more films. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe many other talented producers. We wish him a moment with FAME with a great fortune to win. Has he produced any mock-U dramas? or maybe someone docudrama ??? A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great television movie written by STAN EVANS. How many screens have he written ?? Is he under $$$$$$$$$$$$$ billion trillion contract with Disney ?? He was going to earn more than $ 50 million ... He could also write a TV movie about the late KING OF POP .. Michael Jackson. We will see much more of and by Stan Evans in movies and on TV. Thank you. Elvis has left the building !!!!!
