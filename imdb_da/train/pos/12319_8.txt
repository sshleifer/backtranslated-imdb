First thing first is the women's management too beautiful to be missed. Now actor Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the movie, is 42 years old and well-aged. It is always good to go through these glorious times when you see old-school HongKong productions like this one. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the most influential titles made in the 1980s. Art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all fascinating. More amazingly, the film had a totally black humorous undertone in it. It feels like a horror movie, but in the end it's not scary but just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story" and I thought the script was a decent writing. But when I saw the movie, I was first disappointed to see the film differently than the script, which on a smaller scale and involved several comic roles. But it turned out to be better done in terms of being entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarities in this movie to LOTR. The Climax is like a mirror by Miranda Otto who is fighting with the ring witch. It's certainly a laugh. Bravo!
