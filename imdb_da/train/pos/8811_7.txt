Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world gather in this movie to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best bets you want to see in any movie. Movies like this are rarely made and appreciated. This movie is trying to touch every possible core of the WTC. Here are some of the most important stories from the movie that make this movie so unique. <br /> <br /> There is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for the attacks from America. There is a teacher trying to educate his students by informing them of innocent people who are killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where a movie maker comes face to face with a dead soldier in the WTC attack and a Dead Hard Core Terrorist involved in WTC attacks. Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where a group of five innocent children see Osama Bin Laden and are planning to kidnap him and win rewards money from America. Then we see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico), where you see a black screen, and slowly you see the real recording of WTC buildings coming down. And the people stuck in the building jump out of it to save their lives. The second most important story is from Mira Nair (India), where a mother struggles to respect his dead son whose name is mistakenly captured in the WTC massacre! After September 11, our palpitations will automatically attack pumps if we hear two names all over the world. First, the World Trade Center and the other is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and makes a strong point of claiming something more to it. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves having such kind of Home DVD Collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not wait any more except for movies on this DVD. There are, of course, films of filmmakers, but no extra features.
