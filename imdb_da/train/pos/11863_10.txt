Perhaps it could be the best movie ever made, and if not, it's definitely one of those burned to your students like what Brian De Palma delivers here, a great piece of filmography. First there is the director's touch of Brian De Palma, who again turns out to be one of the best instructors ever. There is the amazing achievement of Al Pacino that delivers an immortal on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with chainsaw, the one in which Tony sits in a bath that is as large as most living rooms), there are many fantastic one-liners many times the word "f * ck" used), there are the amazing little details (Pan American globe that scream "the world is yours") or the great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing to mention, it's no wonder here, and it's easy with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever made!
