If you came into the movie with expectations, you should throw them away now because no hype will do this movie justice. <br /> <br /> To categorize this movie into a single genre would be criminal. It is a spy thriller, features elements of noir, pieces and actions, science fiction and cyberpunk all linked with a brilliant tale, bend of plot twists and a beautiful filmography. <br /> <br /> A lot of the comments here have centered on being distracted, in both good and bad ways, by other movies. But as they say, every story cribs from Shakespeare, so when you can get past it, you're in for a hell of a trip. You have to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never gets incredible, there are servings (read: the elevator) that suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. Don't get it wrong to mean that it is at the same level as the cheesy Sci-Fi channel film because it is at a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for action, turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you are willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel movie experience, then do it now! Watch this movie now before it gets cold to have seen it!
