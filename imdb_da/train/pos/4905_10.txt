"An album with songs so old everyone believes they are new." This movie has the uncomfortable combination of tempo and mood that sets some movies apart from the opening moments. And why not? Think talent from Dame Judith Dench as a widow playing saxophone with a street musician to help him get the songs to the right, to Olympia Dukakis as the joyful widow living in a Scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages. Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all members of another world war all girls (more or less) swing band. But wait, there's more. Add in Leslie Caron on bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine in the lead, and finally Blonde Bombshells is the hottest band in England since the Beatles. Well, okay, not really, but this movie is a winner. Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole movie trying to reunite Blonde Bombshells to play on her grandson's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how hard and brave it would be for a bunch of sex-genetic women to step on stage in front of the Britney Spears generation after an action called "Open Wound." At age when the actors in career are over when they are 30, most bands' second album is the biggest hit collection, and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay, it's great to see real talent, real music And a really good movie comes from where else, the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I know I will see it many more times and enjoy it every time.
