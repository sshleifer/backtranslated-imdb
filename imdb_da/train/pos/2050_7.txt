Everyone has bills to pay and that includes Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war is over and go home when they see a lot of POWs, including Christopher Walken. After a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guys split a dollar bill promising something or something. <br /> <br /> Cut for the present (1991) and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He succeeds first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to surrender and is shot in the head of live TV. This is shown in full detail as a newsflash on American telly, which leads Walken to gather the old troop (although he was not part of this squad to begin with) to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumental silly movie, but for all that, it's also a good laugh and also packaged. This is one of the films where the logic gets a wide berth - how can Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking a window? It also seems that these guys can poke down scores of drug dealers in New York without bothering the police. <br /> <br /> There are lots of b-movie madness chewing here from Michael Ironside's devilish play in Vietnam sequence to the heroic but utterly meaningless death of one of the heroes, to the split confrontation between Walken and El President, and let's not forget the eerie speech of the sister of the rebel leader who was seen on television in America (almost a brown tear to my eye, that bit). <br /> <br /> It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can also see the camera's crew.
