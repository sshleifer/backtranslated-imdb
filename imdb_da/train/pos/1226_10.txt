They filmed this movie on the long island where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is a party scene where they all drink beer (as they told me it was colored water, tasted scary and were very hard to keep on sinking again and again, especially in the scenery). Yet none of us have ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came to the theaters (of course), and as far as I knew it was never released on video, and I'm sure it wasn't released on DVD. Still, it seems that it was seen by some people, though probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love to buy this for my brother, but there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how this movie could be purchased? And what format would be?
