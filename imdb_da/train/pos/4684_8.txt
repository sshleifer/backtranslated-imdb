Petter Mattei's "Love in the Time of Money" is a visually stunning movie to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a living portrait of human relations. This is a movie that seems to tell us what money, power and success do for people in the different situations we face. <br /> <br /> This is a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's game on the same theme, the director transmits the action to today's New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is somehow connected to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous contact point. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. The only thing you get out of all these souls in the picture are the different stages of loneliness that each individual resides. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relations find sincere fulfillment, as a distinction is the case with most people we encounter. <br /> <br /> The act is good under Mr. Matt's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters alive. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and eagerly awaits his next job.
