Some thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published an interview with books by the Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This movie tackles Sadoul today as he recalls the interview as we listen to the cassettes (Herge died in 1983) and saw some old pictures and pictures of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Herge, and we now know that they treated his separation from his wife after having an affair with one of his partners (who would later become his second wife) . An interesting thing that the film does not fit well with has changed in the Tintin books from the early right-wing and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in the Soviet Land) to rather anti-imperialist books just a few years later (The Blue Lotus). All in all, I come out of this movie and know some more things about Herge and see him as a little more unlikely than when I enter the theater.
