I was fortunate enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have seen it for the second time. The first time was on Sennat TV in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and gloomy movie. Not many people like this movie because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is almost no dialogue in this respect - we just hear the character of the character - is only an unconventional aspect of it. Searching for a copy of this movie I found out that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, it was not stored in any British television or movie files, it was never released on video or DVD, TV networks around The world destroyed it after their copyright expired in the 80s. When it first appeared on television in Australia, there were no recordable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> Recently, I could see why it was unforgettable. At times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, like a Harold Pinter stage game. <br /> <br /> Again, if anyone wants a DVD copy of this, please contact me and I am sure we can work out a Greeting Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
