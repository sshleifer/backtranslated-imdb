This movie started slowly and then gained momentum in the middle. But the fact that the film ran over two nights, broke the momentum at the top. The second part was really interesting, but then gave way to a simple pathetic ending. Playing football in the yard? Really, could it get more sappy and maudlin? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I will not make much effort to tune into one if it is something like "The 60s."
