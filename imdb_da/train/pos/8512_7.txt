I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I haven't seen it yet, but I crawl on the idea that someone is actually paying to see me full. Especially considering what we did that year. The thing is, they probably over edited it. Especially the scene where my roommate was talking cola of a Mexican prostitute's breasts (they should probably have followed him around). We made a couple of come and go looks, but apart from that I really can't remember anything. I was a MC in a few scenes (from what I'm talking about. What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew as who will be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her breasts to the world (or the girl the loser lost her virginity to.) All in all, the trip was crazy, but people act differently when the camera is on them.
