This was the second post in the regular Columbo series, and it is doing well today. As I look at it now on DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the fine MACHO CALLAHAN as well as countless television episodes) - see how the Murder's post-murder acts are shown on a split-screen effect on his two glasses, see how the murder itself is shown in montage mode, see the point of view from the perspective of the body. Also the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score from the noted jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere. And Brett Halsey's golf pro performance was wonderful - such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional cut. The "formula" had not yet been set when this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the highest actors, and it is a pleasure to see them work - all men are familiar with many other roles, but lose themselves in their characters here. All in all, this post in the Columbo series - and many of the others - is as suitable as a very good feature film.
