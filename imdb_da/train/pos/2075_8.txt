Saying a movie is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to see a depressing movie if there is a point to make and this has determined one. It is the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family, as they experience many years with both hardships and masses. BUT I have to warn you that this may only be about the most depressing movie that comes out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because the peasant life in China was LITTLE to say the least. Be prepared to see segments of famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> About the only negative, except the persistent tone of misery, is that the lead is played by Paul Muni. While he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a shame that Hollywood is always throwing people of European descent to play Asian leaders this time. If you are aware at all, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong for that part.
