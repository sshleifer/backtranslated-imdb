Citizen X tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer called "The Rostov Ripper" This amazing movie shows the long journey it took to try to perceive a killer. The film shows how politics can gardens helped the murderer to continue his violence for over 12 years. (Possibly over 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as leading detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall study leader were excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of movie that will fascinate you and immediately you have on the internet to investigate the real case. This is a movie that must not be missed. It debuted I believe in HBO and never got a theatrical release for my understanding. Great film
