This movie is amazing. Now I have a tendency for my movies to be heavy on the story and the dialogue, but now and then something like Moonwalker comes in and it can be seen despite many mistakes. <Br /> <br /> This movie is no more than a very entertaining Michael Jackson advertisement. Starting with sickly video set to 'Man in the Mirror' a montage showing his performance and bits and bobs from his career, it goes through all heights in his life and then goes down into a truly entertaining segment that works like a fun music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', after MJ's adventure as he runs from manic stop-motion fans and finally dances against a rabbit suit. The stop movement is not as bad as some would have you believe. That is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the amazing video for 'Let me be alone' and right into the main function. Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous. We see Michael going out of a building, so being shot by thousands of troops. So we hit the flashback showing MJ and three kids stumbling on an underground lair. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is the disgraceful villain who plans to have any child in the world affiliated with "drugs" (no specifications mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl he is with are caught, so chased ... yada yada yada. The reason is not really the important part. We get two very cool sequences, where MJ turns into a car, so a robot spacecraft thing, and of course the amazing 'Smooth Criminal' sequence. <br /> <br /> It's such a movie, but it's great for anyone who likes MJ. It has most of his biggest hits and some nice little bits and some very good special effects (the Robot / spaceship sequence in particular) Worth it, especially as if you can pick it up for a quid on ebay. It will keep the kids calm for a few hours, as well as most 20 somethings who were children when they were first released.
