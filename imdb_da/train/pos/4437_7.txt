This police procedural is no worse than many others in its era and better than a few. Of course, it follows the steps "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but appears as an enjoyable programmer. The best thing about it is the unclear look it gives to a world that has long gone ... the lower class New York in the late 40s / early 50s. Here it is in all its seedy honor, from the old school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons. These old police films are like travel documents for a bygone era and very bittersweet to someone who does not like the sanitized, rare cityscape today. <br /> <br /> Also exciting is the emphasis on nuts and bolts of scientific aspect by solving the crime ... in this case found the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our most important heroes, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the footwork, but without the "boring boys" boring and careful efforts, they would not come anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the police here use the dog site persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to track their husband. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers have written about this movie, you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and dealt with extras from his movie. What is it! I enjoyed John Miles when the regular ex-Marine beat police Tobin ... he had a happy and fortunate approach to the role, which is a welcome change from the usual rock-like histrionics of most moviecops from the period. Patricia Barry is cute and lovely as her perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is slut and droll as the older detective Corrigan. I liked these two chemistry and it did something for something other than that kind of robot dragon approach. <br /> <br /> The mystique itself is not too deep, and the ultimate hunting and shooting is certainly not going to be among the classics of crime, but during the short run, "The Tattooed Stranger" has more than kept my interest.
