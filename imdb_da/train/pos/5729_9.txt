This is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of artistic Lynch audiences. They tend to try to write this out as a kind of pointless, crude, side project by Lynch's. Like this, Lynch is passing gas between his real pieces of cinema. Well, it can be a freak, but it is one of the exciting farts you get and is embarrassed to admit you enjoy. Dumbland distilled over this is art. What can you do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you took it seriously, you would go nuts. You hook into it, smell it, taste it, feel its agonies, its unreasonable stupidity, and express it on any medium you choose. It's called art, and art is not stupid. But it's Dumbland.
