Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hitman or professional killer, decides to leave the company and his former employers do not agree. As for content, this extremely comfortable action movie doesn't have one; in the form of pure amusement it is fun, it is very melodramatic, violent, rather brutal, the cargo is remarkable. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious, yet very sympathetic movie much better than the current Hollywoodian bin that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's rather short flirt with the Italian B cinema in the 70's. It carefully uses Delon's hard guy persona who belongs to the gallery of bad robbers he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Delon making this movie that he had a role in a good Eurocrime flip. The result is very good, with a good introduction song ??????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????? In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out the very appealing Erika Blanc (31 in '73) appears as a named hooker. However, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a starlet who almost left the movie after '75). "Arzenta" is interesting filmed ?? an ambitious visual performance, some expressionist distinctive angles. The film was directed by the productive Duccio Tessari, who also made the Zorro (Delon Comedy). Without mentioning that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very odd. The first is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie - the other is a lightning-fast comedy, more subject to a spoof, but remarkably coherent and skillfully made. Duccio Tessari directed movies like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Satan's Sons, The Bloodline Butterfly, Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
