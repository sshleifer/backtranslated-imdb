"Victor doesn't have much, but it doesn't stop him from trying to go out with Judy, the most beautiful girl in the block. All he has is hope and a one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family. His grandmother doesn't trust him, his brother worships him, and his half-sister just declared war, but Victor believes that love can really conquer everything in this warm, genuine and touching romantic comedy about life in that part of the city that most people never see " according to the DVD's synopsis. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett's "Raising Victor Vargas" evokes engaging "debut" performances by lead actor Victor Rasuk (like Victor Vargas) and cast. Mr. Rasuk and juicy Judy Marte (like Judy Gonzalez) are sexy and endearing as "Lower East Side Kids" who discover the joy of sexual attraction. Considering how attractive they look at this image, it is not hard to predict that they associate - and although you may wonder how "innocent" they really are, their characterization looks. Victor's brother "Nino" is played by Victor's brother Silvestre Rasuk, who sees the part his elder brother plays. Sometimes it is nice to watch movie brothers who actually look the same; and hopefully they will work together again. "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs" sister Krystal Rodriguez (like Vicki) and the old world Altagracia Guzman (as grandmother) round out the sex-hungry Dominican immigrant family. So are handheld cameras that come in live movies in fashion or what? <br /> <br /> ******* Raising Victor Vargas (5/16/02) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, July Marte, Silvestre Rasuk
