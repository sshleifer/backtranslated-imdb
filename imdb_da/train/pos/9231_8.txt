FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry into the nunsploit genre - just share sleaze, feminist travel and "history" as we follow Flavia on her strange trip. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in a monastery. . She is not too happy to cuz she does not believe in all the male-dominated "rules" and macho-ism in the world around her and escapes from the monastery with her Jewish friend, Abraham. They are both eventually captured, and Flavia is brought back to the monastery, where she joins another "non-believer" non-accelerating Muslim invasion. Flavia hangs out with the Muslims who take over the monastery and get "busy" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. In the end, Muslim rollout and Flavia are punished as a traitor to Christianity in another unique brutal scene ... This one has virtually all of the things that I like to see in a 70's era utilizing movies - A good gap, nipple removal, and a lovely bone loss scene, a decent nudity - including the required full front and a decent story. I want to say that it sorta pulled in a few points but not enough to get sad. I would definitely recommend this to nunsploit / 70's utilizing fans ... 8/10
