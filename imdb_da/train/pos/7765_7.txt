Douglas Sirk manages this exaggerated drama of the unhappy wealthy. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are boyhood friends with different looks of life. Kyle is the female son of an oil drug; Mitch works for Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; But it is Kyle who has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the town's nymphomaniac and carries a torch to Mitch, who always seems to be the one who cleans Hadley's fairs. Ambitious with pretension; A little over the top, but the stars make it a movie to watch. I was most impressed with Malone. Rounding off the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
