It is a difficult movie to classify "10 items or less". Generally, I don't care about defining genres, but there's something about this movie that will put you in a particular category to transfer, even with just one word, your feelings about it. I recommend this movie to everyone and if you really enjoy the cinema, and if you enjoy life, you will do the same as soon as you finish watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and lovely admission it is not perfect but it does nothing wrong. I won't sound like I contradict myself, but I think author / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was coming into when he finished writing this inspirational script. I'm sure he wanted to get a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple, appealing and uncompromising as its title. Well, he did. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic films such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", shows with "10 items or less" closing in just 70 minutes, the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it. To put an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places that normal life would take them is what Silberling suggests here. <br /> <br /> I can't tell you anymore, because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought-provoking background that should not be underestimated. Because all of them are vulnerable: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that are not endless just because life is life. And let me express how praise how well Silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time (not only in the film's duration, but in the only day the film develops its events) and in a smaller place, that kind of connection between two characters generated by Sofia Coppola in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> The movie that was set in Tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman, and they also had talks about the moments they lived in their lives. It is in the conversations that we feel the even provocative quality of "10 items or less" and just as in Coppola's film, nature in any situation is never lost, and the pictures with all music and no words do not appear to be forced or included on picture to "buy time". <br /> <br /> In this regard, the collaboration between Silberling and his director of photography is Phedon Papamichael. The man who shot the beautiful scenery in "Sideways" and focused on all the emotions in "Patch Adams", welcomes us here with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate beauty of "10 Items or Less" is in its cast (Avy Kaufman), in its two main characters. They are the ones who transmit this feeling I mentioned at the beginning and I cannot state; we feel their connection and we can tell they have fun and maybe even improvise things. Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman, also a film-producing producer, just stands there confirming the status he has today in the film industry, and one who is well-deserved: a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry like He can make you laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said, she was amazing in "Spanglish")? Here she shows that she is the right deal, and Hollywood is not small for her.
