I thought this step was very good. There were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall I was totally surprised. The courtroom scene eventually seemed a bit unrealistic, but was real enough to be entertaining. I found out that the movie reported the difficulty of walking even though military training and the victims accompanying it. Being a military pilot I could relate to many of these parts.
