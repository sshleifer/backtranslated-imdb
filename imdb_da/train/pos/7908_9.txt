I recently found a copy for $ 5 in a video store and looked it up eagerly. While the music and (of course) graphics are not in line with my favorite in the Beyond the Mind's Eye series, I'm still involved with a segment: Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Is". The music is brilliant and the feelings feel real. The clip on Odyssey's website unfortunately does not have the story or the music.
