The material in this documentary is so powerful that it brings me to tears. Yes, tears I tell you. This popular struggle for a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights, spread the greater benefit of society and cease to make false excuses not to challenge the establishment. Chavez represents the weak and unhappy in the same way Bush is the face of dirty companies and capitalism ran wild. In fact, Latin America is being transformed and the marginalized majority finally has a voice for over five centuries. But in Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He tries to change the constitution to let him rule indefinitely. It cannot be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the movie; The pace is the breath of moment and deeply philosophical of others. It portrays Chavez as a popular completely untouched to challenge the US hegemony and domination of world resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing stops you from doing your homework. A crucial message of the film is the question of sources of information that it was clear from the shreds of fatal accidents were blatantly blamed on Chavez's supporters. Venezuela is shaming American alleged democracy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
