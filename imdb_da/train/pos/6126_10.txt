I saw Jack Frost at 4:00 am at my local store, and I thought it looks pretty good for a low-budget movie, so I bought it and it was right, it was good. Initially, this movie is about a killer snowman, so it's something to laugh about and the way it looks was fun compared to Snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The action was okay, and the lines Jack Frost said I laughed, "I've only been practicing for a smoke" and "The world's most pi ed off snow cone", how fun and camp is the? The story in the beginning was pretty funny and silly also "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack gouged eyes with candles". If you're looking for a B-Movie Comedy horror full of puns, check out Jack Frost out. 10.10
