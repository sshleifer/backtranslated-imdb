Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten overall in the IMDb user's rankings. Maybe it's just cool not to give Titanic credit today, but since it was first made, it was really something. When the movie came out, people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video, my sister and I would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were occupied and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forget, like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the restless crowd. Many people died on this ship, and to convey it to movies with the immediacy and feelings needed, is a tough challenge that James Cameron went up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a phenomenon of a person's imagination, it was great. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They probably as hell give Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I will never let go, Jack." Titanic is a great movie down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant plays, excellent filmography, beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows when someone says they hate this movie.
