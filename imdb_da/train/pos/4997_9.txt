This is a great movie for any fan of action movies from Hong Kong. Aside from its small plot, the weak drama and the pieces of comedy antics, the movie is full of gunfire and martial arts. Kept me entertained from the beginning to the end. I thought Shannon Lee was great in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps Hong Kong action strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
