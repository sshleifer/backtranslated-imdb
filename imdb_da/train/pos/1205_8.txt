This movie is exactly what its title describes - an attempt to get you to buy into what the authors have to offer. First, it's a little fun to see the 1996 style Toronto, I remember with all its stupid haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really hasn't changed anyone; just a good, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater that is a great venue for international movie types! It is also fun to see Kenny and Spenny head to LA and find out that it is Toronto again, only with a strange assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers and even more opity movie types. <br /> <br /> I can't see Pitch as a movie to be enjoyed; It is not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys seeing the hopes of others. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money are really kept by studio experts and production houses. Would be (and "successful") writers, musicians and actors are still only transients, even when they reach the big time. <br /> <br /> So Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
