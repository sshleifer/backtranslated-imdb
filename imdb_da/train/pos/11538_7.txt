Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dumped by his wife because he is one of the most annoying, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just can't seem to make it work, so he heads over to his friends' house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also recently divorced and living it in undergraduate heaven. Smoking, games, frames on chickens, dining and never cleaning is paradise for him. Even with suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix move in. Initially it is a fight in heaven, Felix boils and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time, but soon Oscar jonesing for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to move on . They invite a couple of British birds over, and they find Felix so sore that they soon and Felix crying and chatting about his family life and leaving Oscar denied. That's what he explodes and throws him out of, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote "You leave me small notes on my pillow. Tell you 158 times, I can't stand small notes on my pillow." We are all out of cornflakes. F.U. "Took me three hours to find out F.U. was Felix Kids!" Based on a Neil Simon game (which also wrote the script), this has a certain theater experience. Set and repartee and look feel quite playful (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and are featured in Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea, reprising the same finicky / slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalties, I'm sure). <br /> This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, strawberries are tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get these unpleasant greens). They are almost polar opposites, but together they contrast each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
