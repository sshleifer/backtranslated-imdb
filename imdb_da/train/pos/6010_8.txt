"Zabriskie Point" (1970): This was particularly interesting to me on a personal level, as it happens under identical circumstances with identical peers in my own life ?? Counter Culture movement in the late 60s / early 70s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated youths in separate stories that are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of the endless pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunch room on his campus, and the other a young woman driving to Phoenix to see his father and employer and take an "establishment" job. The film is FULL of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notes from America, and the confused, psychedelic features of that era are self-righteous, "we know it all, we change everything to the better" youth. Just who is the "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Do you dress like one and march around chanting? Do you fly under the radar, but give advance notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself and go about the change business without needing group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "piece" - full of snake, uniforms, slightly surreal movie moments (after all, this is a movie by the man who gave us the amazing "Blow Up" from 1966) and the era's artifacts, but it is more. It presents opportunities for the Cultural Revolution and goes by Antonioni (who seems to be supportive of it), the youth is too self-interested to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, scary movie that applies to anyone, preferably anywhere.
