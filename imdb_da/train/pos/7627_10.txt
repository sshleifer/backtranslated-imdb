I remember watching the movie a while ago, and having seen 3000 miles to Graceland came back. Why hasn't this yet had a video or DVD release? It is devoted that this majesty in film production has never been released while other filth has been. In fact, it is the one John Carpenter movie that has not been released. In fact, I haven't seen it on television either since the day I saw it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for Elvis. This is certainly a role he was born to play. John the carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that I would love to watch the TV again. It is well acted and well done as far as the song goes. Belt out most of Elvis's biggest hits with gusto. I also think it was the movie that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which made them continue to make a number of great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Problems in Little China and Escape from LA Someone have to free this before someone remakes or their own version of his life, which I feel will not only pursue the king but also destroy the magic that it has, if this is not released then we will come to the Heartbreak Hotel.
