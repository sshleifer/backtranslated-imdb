I really liked this movie because I have a man like the guy in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey, who meets Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is not in. She falls in love, but when spring comes together, she gets shocked by her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal as Ben has put on her. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie with all the baseball occupations Ben has. He can't share what he loves most, that's what makes it so much fun and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. Also, the people he sits in baseball games are as obsessed as he is. It's a fun movie and you won't knock out if you rent it.
