This movie is the best movie to watch cartoon feeling. The sets, costumes and color are just as alive, it's like stepping into a comic book. This is the movie I think of when Mob is mentioned, suits, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comic relief like Mumbles, and you can't help excusing Madonna as she tries, and fails to win Tracy. This movie contains all the classic bullies - burying people in concrete, blowing people's cars, tying the good guy and trying to blow up his boyfriend's house. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic in a sense of the word, even camera angels cry cartoon. It's so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how to make a cartoon in a movie after seeing such mistakes as Spawn and the Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
