That is what, e.g. Should be. And Pushing Daisies live up to the expectations. A beautifully crafted and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows back at prime-time, with integrity, good for the whole family and sparking your imagination. It is not about the normal actions, sex, money or murder angles of all other exhibitions at t.v. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but even though the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are right for all of us. Want something you can't have, hopes that someone wants us, runs away from your past and seeks family, even in the most unlikely places, etc ... I realize ABC has basically canceled this wonderful show on this time, and will probably replace it with some way beyond the integrity point. I suppose everything comes back to money ... it's too bad that now there are no other shows on ABC that actually make you feel good after seeing.
