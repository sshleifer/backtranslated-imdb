I loved this movie. I thought it would be easy to see and easy to forget. I ran out after seeing this to buy the DVD, not easily forgotten! <br /> <br /> The writing is brilliant and the casting couldn't be more perfect. Each character has their moment, and I laughed hard through this movie, comedic timing was spot-on. <br /> <br />
