Popular radio storyteller Gabriel None (Robin Williams, scraggy and talking in shelf, hypnotic tones) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who has written a book describing sexual abuse from his parents. To start, Pete has AIDS and this further forces Gabriel as his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) happens to be a survivor of HIV itself. <br /> <br /> He is also familiar with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides to meet and talk to two of them personally and go to Wisconsin, some discover secrets he (of course) was not willing to find. <br /> <br /> Based on real events that happened with Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves much faster (90 min, maybe a few minutes longer) than one might think a movie of this genre would run. It's good because it keeps the action and story lean and clear. It is bad that it leaves various holes in the plot and does not sew up any of the plot openings or the back story. I would rather not go into any details except to say that if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's works or his personal story, you feel a bit out of the loop here. Still, the notion of Williams (I would have loved to hear more of his story in person), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and much of the supportive cast (the waiter at the Collete's Donna restaurant does a great job with the little part she Have!) is first class and the atmosphere established here - namely the cool, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - provides a great setting for this story. It may have ends that do not attach particularly well, but it is still a convincing enough story to stick to.
