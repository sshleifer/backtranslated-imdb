Captured the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable film channels, and was so fascinated that I was searching for the next show. I didn't really know what to expect after reading the guide, but I got away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed. It also gave me as an adult who participated in high school in the 80s, a little better insight into what our children must fight with these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you don't see the shooting adds only to the chillness of the plot. To see both children and adults alike struggle to understand and express themselves with the pointless shootings was sometimes overwhelming. And will admit that I throw quite a few tears throughout. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a movie that I would find out what I am sure I saw.
