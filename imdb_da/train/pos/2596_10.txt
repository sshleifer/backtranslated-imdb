The movie's adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses is excellent. The actors, voice overs, the direction, it all captures the novel's feelings without sacrificing its own benefits. Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the cuckolded man married to the sassy Molly. I absolutely love this picture.
