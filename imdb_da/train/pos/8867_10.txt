I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on DVD one day. The episode of Hilton's eccentric genius brother, George (played by late Roscoe Lee Browne), is classic hilarity. It reflects the classical sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths, but both ended with happiness. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad brilliantly resumed the chemistry they shared at The Cosby Show for many years, and to put them in a more middle-class role, they show the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> The comedian dynamite rider ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
