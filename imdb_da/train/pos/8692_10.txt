I used to love to see this. I had no idea that it was part of a larger series. I must have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV. I just thought it was fun and for some reason I had a deep fascination with something that was clear that it was in the president's pile of bath toys. My parents had lost this from television as it was originally broadcast on NBC. The band even had the old Sanka coffee commercial along with a few others. I plan to return home sometime soon and will try to record the tape on my computer so that those who want a copy can do so. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do it through the IMDb site, feel free. I will keep you updated and tell you when I have the show in a digital format.
