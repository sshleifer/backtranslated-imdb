Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the 'Trivia' section) on how it was. It seems as if fate was playing to test Kamal Amrohi (the director), while secretly wanted to see him complete his masterpiece. Pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elution. The result is that the intensity with which emotions come out achieves a dimension that may not be very real, but which is very effective and has an influence on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as her own. The other stars of the film, besides her, are Ghulam Mohammed (the music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and movie films leave you spelling bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in the world cinema. It reveals new layers to you every time you see it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.
