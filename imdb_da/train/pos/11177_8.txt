***** Spoil here ***** <br /> <br /> What scares you really? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring a message back? Maybe a chainsaw with psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears do not even compare with a horror that people dare not talk about or consider - and that is the death of one's own child. "Pet Sematary" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore. <br /> <br /> I've read comments on this movie that contain bad actors making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. The action is actually first rate for a movie like this. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the film's events are not only logical, they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": It is not that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scallops. It is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate to commit the crimes Louis Creed does. Despite warning or even past history. <br /> <br /> The movie takes those who are willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector is trying to make up for not being able to protect. And the results are terrible. In fact, when the film dives into the slasher area near the end, it's almost a downturn, though I think it's quite logical how it came there. <br /> <br /> I am a true horror fan and I claim this is one of the scariest horror movies ever made. If you do not believe it, look again when you have children.
