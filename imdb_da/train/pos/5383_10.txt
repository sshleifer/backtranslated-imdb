I thought this movie was great because Corrine and Sean are new to the company. It was filled with action and a little romance, but there were some points when Corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she threatened Sean with gun) and she tied her teeth ... maybe she? I think Joseph and Sonny's roles were portrayed very well and there was a clear contrast. Also, because I saw the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean made their own stunts, which were performed very well. I'm looking forward to another movie of the couple as they make a good team, or maybe a sequel to betting on your life - possibly called "make it big in the big apple," this could be about Carmen this time. life is EXCELLENT!
