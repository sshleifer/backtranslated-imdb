Best animated movies ever made. This film not only explores the great world of modern animation with absolutely enchanting effects, but the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. The story has a family of cats where the big sister dies, the younger brother sees this and saves her body, but when she awakens, she becomes without soul. Then the two sibling cats go on a journey to find it. I have related this journey to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I see it, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so into the physiological aspect of it, then you will still adorn it. The animation is great and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen. For example, the sea freeze in time, God eats soup out of the ground, a strange and little SNM tale by Hansel and Gretel. Eventually, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS-Not for children, included free violence.
