Okay, this movie is stupid. However, I think that is in a good way. It was stupid on purpose and was one of the better "stupid" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are targeted badly, but delivered in a way that hit all the right notes with me. The support staff were pretty low and mediocre. There is a beautifully weak plot, but it works fine. <br /> <br /> Elvira character is the focus here. She is lovable and adorable. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie. At the top of the actor talent she had physical attributes that were honest, stunning. Few men could disagree with that. The parts showing his figure were also some of the more fun scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a smiley ear to ear from the first scene at last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of comedy and for fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.
