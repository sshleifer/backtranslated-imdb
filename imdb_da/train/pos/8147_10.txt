Fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of Hip-Hop culture. It's as much fun as this is spinal loss, if not more fun. The actors are amazing and the documentary style is amazing. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that has to play the leading role in many more films. This movie is a sand cult classic!
