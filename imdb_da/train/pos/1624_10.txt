The Old Mill Pond is more of a tribute to the African-American entertainers of the 30s than any kind of decline of the entire race (Stepin Fetchit caricature regardless). Besides who I just mentioned, there are also seed or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmony cartoon from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very entertaining musical with perfect characterizations all around. They sound as much as the real thing half of me think they might be. If not, they are certainly very flattering impersonations. Even the lazy, shiftless Fetchit characterization gets an exciting training here when he is chased by a tiger when "Hold That Tiger" plays on the score. Recommended for fans of 30's animation and jazz music.
