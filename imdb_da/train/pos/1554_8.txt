I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with scary protective suits. The experienced British soldiers make gas masks (only) and wait for gas clouds and German invaders once again. The gas plates move ever closer and finally the British defenders encircle. The Germans move forward slowly threateningly in their frightening appearance. Suddenly a scream from the defenders ... This gas is like no one else they have experienced before .... <br /> <br /> Now you want to know why I remembered this scene in the last 30+ years and Still shaking, I think you will too!
