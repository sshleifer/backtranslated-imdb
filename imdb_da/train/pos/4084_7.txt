I suppose this is supposed to be some sort of reworking or updating of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can't say I have ever seen a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex. Wow. Still, it seems that a young woman and her..aunt? Have traveled to this castle in France, where the woman is getting married to the son of the castle owner, who is the man who takes care of ensuring the horses get their stones away. It seems that there are legends in the area of ​​an animal that was rather, terribly, I think you could say with the ladies or at least one particular. There are all sorts of references hidden away in this respect, but each time the soon-to-be-broken young bride gets her curious little hands on one, the groom's father removes it from her sight. Yet the young bride goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a cardinal to show up to the wedding (a family member I believe) and that she dreams she is dreaming of an animal in the woods that has her way with her. The effects in this leave a little to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not what I know a lot about) is a bit ridiculous, especially when certain highlighted annexes appear about as realistic as a bedside or baseball bat. This has a rather weird and abrupt but twisting end, with not really some traces or much build it up, but it was a little appropriate and certainly not what I had expected. I don't know, it's a little hard to get through, but it has its moments and is quite strange. 7 out of 10
