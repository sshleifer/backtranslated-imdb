The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very strange. This is because parts of the film are in French with subtitles, and the rest is translated into English from French. Sometimes the characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to make the movie become subtitled or just dubbed, it made no difference! Odd, but still visible. <br /> <br /> The story presupposes being based on a Poe story, though I can't remember which one. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and end of the movie - though not as special as him. <br /> <br /> A rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he can't stay all night in a way at home. It seems like a light bet to win - even though the house is very scary. However, it cannot be as easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died - but this stupid will still make the effort! While at home, he meets the lovely Barbara Steele inside and falls to her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! How can it be ?! I could tell you more about the plot, but will not spoil any of the excitement. See it yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie gets very high marks to create a grim atmosphere. The house, black and white movies and music work together to make a scary looking movie. As for the plot, it is interesting - especially because there are many twists - as many as you wonder who is and who is not among the undead at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was unnecessarily killed. Crazy as it sounds, I felt sorry and it hardly seemed. <br /> <br /> Parents may also want to know that at the end there is little nudity. A striking beautiful woman seems topless, but it is hardly necessary for the plot.
