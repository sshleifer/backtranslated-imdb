This movie is much better than the asylum version, mainly its world war. The stands look pretty cool, but their walk and death could have been better. The scene scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! Oh, my God stops walking, or I'll kill myself. The thunderstorm scene was my favorite sequence, mainly because a ship hit a lot of stands. Good movie I recommend it to people who have read the book. The music is great and the directors look good. <br /> <br /> Benefits. Good sound track 99% for the book Cold violence Stands and handling machines are cool to look at <br /> <br /> disadvantages. some bad acting cheesy look London
