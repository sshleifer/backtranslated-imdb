Kinematically, this film stinks. It also does a lot of the actor. But I <br /> <br /> don't care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80s were <br /> <br /> (Too many of us in the minority anyway) and what hip-hop, zulu <br /> <br /> the nation and breaking dance were really like. Great music, great <br /> <br /> dancing! It almost seems like a documentary about a time now past <br /> <br /> as hip hop was a lifestyle. It is also interesting to see New <br /> <br /> York looks like ground zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that it was a bad, worn-out city <br /> <br /> during the 70s and 80s. This is the best of all hip-hop / break <br /> <br /> dancing movies that came out around that period. Of course, the <br /> <br /> 80s are considered a joke now with all the bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> movies, but those of us who lived through will always remember <br /> <It was terrible for a time when music, dancing and graffiti were fresh, yo!
