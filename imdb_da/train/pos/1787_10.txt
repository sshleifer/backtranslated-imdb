Danes character finally makes Buddy have the terrible truth. "Let me be alone, kiss men if you will," she screams righteously before everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. Nice girl. This can be the place to reassess all of the gigantic charm that Danes come into this character. Good reason to feel sympathy for her in bed and dying, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes except perhaps to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a moment. This irony is calculated! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic humor, yes! But somehow I doubt what the creators of this movie had in mind. Unfortunately, there may be a few errors.
