This is one of the best animated family movies all the time. In addition, almost all the serious rivals came to this title from the same creative mind Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. In particular, other amazing films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service." Spirited Away is quite good, but a little too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adults. The one thing that puts "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" apart from other movies by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a thrilling adventure trip. Why is this movie so good? Because it is a complete package: the animation is very well done and the story is really engaging and compelling. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but certainly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized and young. None of these problems plague the castle in heaven. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well-drawn if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of these trench-coat pants) There are lots of adventures, but not blood and gore. The animation is smooth, detailed and cinematically allied - not many shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. The voice that appears in the English English version is the first movement, especially the two leaders, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound technology is also great. Use your studio sound if you have it. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left inexplicable. Laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. In fact, it is fair to say that the world is more realized than most of the smaller characters, which are mostly one-dimensional stock characters (eg gruff general, stupid sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) Recommended for people aged 6 to 60!
