A good Korean movie about not only Taekwondo, but what it takes to be good, as a slut's way of fighting can't beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules just like there is life and school, and this movie has undertones of this concept. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie is not that good, but it is acceptable and comfortable. Friends who continue to achieve something that they once would claim become stronger through the mind and heart. This movie is not intended to be taken too seriously as it has a slapstick, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie again from Korea.
