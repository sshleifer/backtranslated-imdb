I thought this movie was well composed. Voice-overs were also good. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to see it. Atlantis has some comics that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It's a movie, which age you can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy "prophet" or until he picks up the crew for the amazing journey under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the film puts better pictures in your mind. It's like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
