This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had slaughtered it after the opening in 1936. Visually, it is strange to see, but the manuscript allows too many intellectual speeches on war and prosperity. This becomes very corny when the actors are given to recite many high-level messages at any time. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss" a megalomanic warlord. The prediction of World War II was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at that time. I'm sure the war didn't show up as it did in the movie. There are some visually stunning assembly sequences that link the leap of time between the various episodes of the movie. While it's not as entertaining as I hoped it would be, this movie stinks in your mind long after you've seen it.
