As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story in advance in no way degraded by the movie. The characters have so many complexities that everyone can relate to them in their own way. The Adaptation's shine is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions on the characters' lives, rather than being a fate-born meaning. You can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Amazing performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I would highly recommend it.
