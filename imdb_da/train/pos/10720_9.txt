Hooray! A space movie that does not take too seriously, and everyone can get together for the exciting trip that is space camp. The movie starts slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and high-fliers mixed together in a risky soup. But when it gets tough, they get tough and it is not an invaluable change in the signs, as one can believe there is some responsibility in their young mind. The only flaw in movies is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as "I'm right and you're all wrong" instructor. I would recommend this as a good night in movie and a 7 vote.
