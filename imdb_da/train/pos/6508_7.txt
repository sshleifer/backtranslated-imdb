I grew up seeing Scooby and having been a fan forever. This cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can become boring to viewers. Crooks in the Mask routine get old and this cartoon is a change from there. It's not supposed to replace the Scooby band, it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers, I'm sure. The cartoon's focus is on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large amount of money and spend the money to counteract the world's conquest plans by a crazy scientist and his goons. Small tributes of the tire and the tire itself are included from time to time. If you're a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog along with the jokes that come with it. Just enjoy Cartoon and support the creators / authors and producers so this won't be the last Scooby Cartoon.
