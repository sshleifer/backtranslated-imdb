The dehumanizing effect of war is a very studied subject in the films; as the equally inhuman, but potentially life-saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated as dirt, but as soldiers, with some mutual respect for their commanders, and the verdict is reserved for such an extreme process to be considered justified; as is the verdict of the war benefits for which they are trained (typically like here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting task by centering its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played excellently by Colin Farrell) who understands that all power ultimately governs with consent and the lack of consciousness among the powerless of their own participation. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been created, and it is also a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket", just to name another movie of the same type, lost focus when the action switched to Asia). While this is not a film of enchanting originality, the highly accomplished and captivating view is all the way through: the best movie of this director I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.
