Great pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to keep an eye on - an absorbing story of intrigue, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who attracts the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) out on a secret mission of his own. They make a nice romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the average, bad pirate that weaves his crooked web of division and conquer. I have noticed Mildred Natwick's very well-known face, which plays a role as Mrs MacGregor, the patron of the young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). There are beautifully filmed landscapes of shorelines, ships and bay. Lots of actions also for sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps from Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). From the fiery redheads I once heard in an interview by Maureen O'Hara that she boasted of great command of bullwhip and could also overcome Flynn in sword fighting these days, but it would not be necessary to try it out. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable movie.
