I don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this movie. It's a pleasure for people who like a strong thrill and dark atmosphere. The tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden for good and evil, down to the local area (Savannah). The action is strong and I was amazed at the verisimility of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is fantastic, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is BOMB. Also the big full nude scene. <br /> <br /> The reason is fairly standard, but effectively done.
