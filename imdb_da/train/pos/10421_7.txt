This is a most beautiful movie. Color photography is beautiful as it shows the opulence of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color. Other indoor scenes on different mansions etc. are just as brilliant. As far as the music is concerned, it can be said more than the Lanza's voice was at its peak when he sang so many of the world's best known and beloved arias. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voices mix with Lanza in lovely harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their traditional freedoms with Caruso's life story. There is precious little in the history line that relates to actual events. Facts about his death, for example, are completely produced and bear no relation to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain more pictures of him. These sites can be located using a good search engine. There are also several books available on his life story. But the fictional story line does nothing to marry this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and choir members are the real stars of this movie. Enjoy, I know I probably did.
