Often laughing loudly, sometimes sad story of 2 work divorce boys - Lemmon a neurotic pure "housekeeper" and Matthau a slob sports writer - who decides to live together to reduce spending. <br /> <br /> Nicely photographed and straightened. The script is very choppy - that is, there is always more than one page for almost any line. Particularly fun scene involves 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem to amuse everything that anyone says, but when Lemmon breaks out of his pictures of children and, yes, ex-wife-to-be, he has the girls sobbing together with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
