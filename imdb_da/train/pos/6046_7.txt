I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Let's face it; The priest does not sound particularly appealing when transferring money to a night's flick, but it had a whimsical nature that wins one over. There were no moments I found uneasy, and I doubt anything that I remember the next day, but it did not fail as a good diversion. What I found fun saw this in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like. I told her there was a plot - three guys have to bring some weeds back to London. Almost satisfactory for her. There is no crushing going on here for the camera that I expected after reading a number of comments. However, I take exception to comparisons with Withnail and I; not in the same league and I doubt it was the intention. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
