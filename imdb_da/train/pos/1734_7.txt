I just watched this movie for the first time ever and I liked it. Her dance was very entertaining. I read somewhere that she was part of this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery was also fantastic. Yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. We laughed at the stupid kissing scenes, but that's what is good with old movies! I grew up with her at The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her previous movie. They may not be all the best out there, but still worth seeing to see her action and sing. I slowly buy all her movies and see them as I receive them. I have a great collection of her memorabilia.
