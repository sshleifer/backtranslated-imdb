Matador is a witty, dark humorous and exciting melodrama that goes far beyond mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who have never been better than here, and the ever-reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role here since Play Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor in as good as it gets. A big plus also goes to the writing. Clear and occasionally very scary dialogue is provided with Gustav's joy and the slow building's friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way. The story takes some unexpected twists and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it is going to go. <br /> <br /> Smart artistic features from the director like good use of music, smart editing and some unorthodox cinematography sometimes make a good note to the movie, and for a long time you don't quite know how to feel the movie. But it is also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (I anyway) on the edge of his seat.
