There are some good comments and observations on this movie. I was pleased to note the comparisons with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (extraordinarily fine performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking his sexually frustrated anger out on his victims - mostly children. He's the target. The real villain is the swelling bureaucratic Soviet system that drowns in its own corrupt incompetence. The devotion of an uncompromising dedicated man (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), a facile pragmatist who is willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always succeeds in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but certainly psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), a prosecutor's bubbling bureaucrat (British British actor John Wood) and the quiet supportive wife of the driven investigator (lovely supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is a damn fine film. Its darkness and gloom are supported by the depiction of a corrupt, incompetent system that counteracts success. There is no need to dip into the gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present - it's a horrible story - but it adds to the depiction of a pathologically twisted man. The success of history is precisely that: these were actions of a person, a human being like you or I. Wherever you and I choose to shed our frustration with reasonable means, Chikatilo took our anger upon us most innocent and vulnerable, our children. The excellent precondition for this story has been manifested by an equally great cast of outstanding actors. - Unfortunately, I notice that our Australian friend did not like the speech and would undoubtedly have preferred to hear them speak in the Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This fine movie was safe for me and everyone else I talked to who saw it.
