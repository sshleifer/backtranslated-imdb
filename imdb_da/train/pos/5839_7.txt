The last (I think) of the films The Boys made with Hal Roach, it is also the last really funny movie they made before going to the 20th century fox, who so famously lost their talents. For example, even if there are weak moments - the company with the "lung tester" is a bit, ah ... overblown (but worth having, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but on the whole this is a flick good summary of what the boys brought on the screen. Richard Cramer (unredited) appeared in other L&H flicks, and he is wonderfully threatening here as prisoner Nick Granger. The scene where the boys should eat their own synthetic meal ("looks good, smells good, and it tastes good good. Eat it.") Is one of my favorite moments in oeuvre. Stan & Ollie will always be nice companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans.
