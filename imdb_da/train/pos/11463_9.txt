I watched this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away. The structure and performance of the movie was amazing ... I don't know, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial, and I can see many people having a lot of trouble with it, as it is about schooling and especially alerting the killers. Despite the hard and dumb topic, Zero Day is so worth seeing. I am looking forward to video, so I can buy it - it is very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the shootout sequence leaves you speechless because it is almost too realistic. Their insecurity, the "recordings", the students' recordings and panic, absolutely indescribable. I really hope it gets the attention it deserves. It's made in the same format as The Blair Witch Project, handheld camera, made to work as a true home video documentary - but God is better off. Very impressive hats for everyone involved. If you have the chance, you really should see it.
