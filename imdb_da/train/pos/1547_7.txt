Like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie, I can only ask myself why it has never been on video. I remember seeing it about 12 years at "The Late Show" circa 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and the strangely hired horses. (I can't remember the more horrible bits I've seen described here, they were probably cut to the television audience.) But the scenes I really liked were those that involved Lord Kitchener's death aboard HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes from the convicted crosses approach the minefield in the storm, was really chilling as I remember. <br /> <br /> Remember the musical score, but the comments of the others have now curious me. Get this video!
