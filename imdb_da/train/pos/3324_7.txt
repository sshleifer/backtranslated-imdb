Someone master the difficult task of merging sports with romance. In reality, sports and romance go together like oil and water. So to successfully put the two together on the screen ... yes, it's about responding to splitting the atom. I never thought it could be done. I want to be the first to say that I generally don't like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most movies about sports. This movie was a pretty good mix of the two. Being a baseball fan, I could really appreciate the comedy trials with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) as a refined Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of Babe who plagued Redsox for 86 years, and they just know how nuts about baseball, many Redsox fans are. The Farrely brothers did a good job catching it and it made for good comedy. This was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
