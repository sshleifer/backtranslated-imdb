On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling in the countryside on a horseback rider certainly does not appeal much to it, but the real power behind the movie is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a film work than "The Straight Story." The perfect example of this is a scene where Alvin meets a running teenage girl. She is pregnant and afraid of what the parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about her own children long ago. He made them take a stick and break it as they could easily do. Then he got them to tie the staples and try to break them. "That bundle," he said, "is family." So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew someone could be broken, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we are wise enough to understand this and simply leave us to consider the thought and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's trip to Iowa is full of such refreshing, non-Hollywood character interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so sweet to ride on his machine that we can't help smiling when he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke . And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination, but the journey. It is a journey where Alvin shares his life with all he meets - for their benefit and ours. It is a slow, simple and relaxing trip designed to remind us of everything we have lost with the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare live-action "G" -rated movie it really should not miss.
