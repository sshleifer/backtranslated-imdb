This film made for French television deals with the tragic effect it has on a close knit family. When Leo, the young man in the center of history is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Christophe Honore for bringing this honest account to the screen. Nowhere, but in France, this story could make it into the movies because of the subject. The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears what Leo has done, despite how the parents will protect him from reality. <br /> <br /> Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job of portraying the brothers.
