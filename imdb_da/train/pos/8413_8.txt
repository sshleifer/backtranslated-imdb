A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. An evil magician approaches him and informs him that he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart if he agrees to give him everything he wants in his room. The stupid guy agrees, and the wizard steals man's reflection out of the mirror - and bad things happen naturally as a result. <br /> <br /> If this movie was made a decade later, I'm sure I didn't want to have been so charitable to review and score this movie. After all, the movie's plot is a bit vague in spots, and the play is sometimes a bit stuttered. But when you consider that "full length" movies in 1913 were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! Moreover, the whole idea of ​​a complex story that you get in this movie is very unusual - as stories were very short and wide-handed. So, given the time constraints, this movie is pretty good and is one of the previous horror films known.
