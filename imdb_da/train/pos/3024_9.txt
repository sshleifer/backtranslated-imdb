A movie that dramatized an understandable reluctance to meet the inevitable coming of World War II when a Spanish Republican, sent by his soon-overthrown government (Charles Boyer) infiltrates into England, seeks support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not selling coal to the fascists back in Spain. He disturbs the locals, becomes convincingly struck in a scene, and later in the film against an angry crowd of miners who see him as another threat to their shaken livelihood. Despite the socioeconomic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this movie expert is partly in a dark and exciting intrigue involving incredible compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and academically recorded in numerous dark-lit scenes set in a boring hotel by James Wong Howe and manages more than once to get under your skin.
