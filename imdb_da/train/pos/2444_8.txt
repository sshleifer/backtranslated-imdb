"GEORGE LOPEZ," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) went into a moving piece of machinery. If you want to know why, you should have seen it yourself. Before I unpack it, I'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though new episodes can be seen at the moment, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it goes well into the air.
