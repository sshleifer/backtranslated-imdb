A brilliant Russian emigrant conceives the Stanislavsky system to win on the contract bridge - making him and his beautiful wife GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. <br /> <br /> What could have been just another silly soap opera is enhanced by fine production values ​​and excellent action for the status of a very fun little comedy. A few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewer's attention engaged - the way the principle is thrown in as faces on a card game; the introduction of a zany acrobat into the ground for no other reason than to enjoy a little lunacy; and the way a wide variety of different Americans turn out to be transfixed by listening to the broadcast of the final game. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas & Loretta Young do very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas suave & sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful (though the manuscript keeps her puff on a cigarette a little too much). They are fun to see, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or compelling. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives another great performance as a relentless cheerful ghost writer who loves Miss Young. The lovely Glenda Farrell scares his usual wisecracking persona in a small role as McHugh's ditsy gal pal. Roscoe Karns handles the talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobby troupe. <br /> <br /> Movie belly recognizes Dewey Robinson as a belligerent nightclub pattern; Emma Dunn as a sister sister reporter; Paul Porcasi as owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian servant; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer at the last bridge fight - all unredited. <br /> <br /> The film exploits the chain of contract bridge that had swept across the country since the evolution of the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the game's intricacies and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed.
