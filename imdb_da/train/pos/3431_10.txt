Simply the best Estonian movie I have ever seen, even though it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters trying to steal a large amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a kind of summary of the conditions in many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 90s, the Soviet Union fell, and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now, conditions can be better in most of these countries. But in the early 90s, many of these new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as an inheritance. (And many of them still ... at least on a certain level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of the era of credible characters and with a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, playing Snaut in Tarkovsky's Solaris), playing and old gangster who slowly gets tired of his lifestyle. But the most amazing achievement comes from Monika Mäger, a children's actor who plays Terje, a boyish girl in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is absolutely crucial. (And her name isn't even mentioned in the IMDb credit list !!!) w <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses do it. Unfortunately, Järvi-Laturi's second film is far from this kind of result. His first, Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest story made at night was just a weird mess.
