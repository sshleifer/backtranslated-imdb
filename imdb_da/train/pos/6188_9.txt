A murder investigation continues on the stage, while Vanities on his opening night plays on an ignorant audience. Countless combinations of musical and murder mystery are worth looking for its cast, its production numbers and the all-new feature of the movie. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has the flashy role a bitch actress intends to stop the marriage of the show stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was also on a 70's Bette Midler album). So while the corpses mingle around the backstage, the detective stifles the Victor McLaglen girls as he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman. <br /> <br /> We quickly learn that the girl (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, that wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage leader (Jack Oakie) encounters everything. Lots of plots twisted among musical tracks. The show's most famous song is "Cocktails for Two." Kitty Carlisle also sings followed "where do they come from?" And there's a weird rhapsody breaking into a Harlem special number with Duke Ellington! Completely thrown. <br /> <br /> Some great deals here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is also quite good. However, Brisson is a total zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and also see if you can see Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls.
