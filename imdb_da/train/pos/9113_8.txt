Probably the first Portuguese movie I've seen in my life and I enjoyed it. The reason is related to how the young chief officers took power in Portugal in 1974 to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and also complete the wars in the colonies, ie. Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect with precision the behavior of chief officers and soldiers to perform the coup, the oppressed people who were very pleased with this new development and freedom, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle manner for most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese Revolution can be remembered because of the actions of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the movie was when the young captain stated that Portugal should develop democratically, and that was what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that chief officers and soldiers would never kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
