If I see a movie and don't even look at my watch or watch to see how much longer it will run, or when I hope the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it should be pretty good. I'm not a movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. I watch movies and if they keep me interested in the end then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed movies kill me (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Reconciliation, Crash. This movie kept me interested and absorbed The action is amazing, the story is completely original, flash-back technique very affective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman throws his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I forgive it because I see it as a tribute to, rather than a rip-off of Orson.
