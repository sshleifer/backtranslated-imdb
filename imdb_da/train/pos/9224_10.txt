This film is visually stunning. Who cares that she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and occupied by John Derek. The sites, sets of designs and costumes work perfectly to convey what is in a love story of beauty, youth and wealth. In some ways I would like to see this movie as a tribute to John and Bo Derek's story. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning Anthony Quinn's role as father, mentor, lover, and his depiction of a man of men who had been lost in a bygone era when men were men. There are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in confidence that contributes to a sense of self-confidence, confinement and security. Yes, they don't make men like that any more! But how often do you find women made as Bo Derek.
