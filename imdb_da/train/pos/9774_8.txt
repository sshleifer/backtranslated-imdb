This movie has its ups and downs but for me the good things in this movie are much outweighed by the bathrooms ... What is not so good with the movie is actually the dialogue, the sounds, the lighting (am I the only one who noticed how the sets were turned on, were amateur and the actor .... What is very good is the very original story, the very intense atmosphere, make the factor very high, and the effects made extraordinarily. <br /> <br / > So definitely worth watching or maybe even a must-see for all of you horror and gore fans ...
