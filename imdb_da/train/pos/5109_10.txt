I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result, I remember nothing about the movie. But I remember the feeling it caused by Gilleys and the mechanical bull of Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin for Love" that still brings the memory back to my children when I hear it. <br /> <br /> But a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult, and all I can say is I was blown away. Few movies have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and genuine as you can get. From Uncle Bob's Ranch House, the Texas City Chemical Factory, Gilley's Dance Hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe it may not have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I can't stand my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique piece of American pie. That's why I love it!
