Worryingly, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after the release. It's a story that any father or brother can relate to ... a brother is a bit "wild," the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly cast as a father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The film closely follows the book with only a few changes that make it more suitable for a movie format. Unlike most movie story books, it measures up. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and slightly emotional movie.
