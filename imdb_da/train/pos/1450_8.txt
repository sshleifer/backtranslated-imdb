Excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other higher ranked movies in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to skip these fantastic career topping performances? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deception. The two actors gels incredibly well together, and Aiello and Fonda support are just as impressive, even though Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers go to print. Instead of focusing on an over-complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful figures that show the human side of a political bribe. The final scenes with each of the protagonists are wonderfully written and acted.
