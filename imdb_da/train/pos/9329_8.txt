I've seen The Perfect Son about three times. I don't see how this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I can't see it as a gay movie. It's a gay-type movie, I can't see why every gay-type movie should be a gay movie. I find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your family. I think Theo turns his life around quite quickly after rehab, because he wants to see his brother die in front of him, make him reconsider his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he must be a father who moves a lot, Ryan says he doesn't want to know about the things he'll never see or share with anyone. Isn't that terrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
