Don't be sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors, but eventually it didn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the last episode of the American tourist talk with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better about mine), which was actually quite touching and a good way to pack the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy, Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi take the prize. The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive, though it was rather ambitious in scope. <br /> <br /> But the Bob Hoskins segment was completely cringeworthy and the vampire story was quite farcical. The dialogue in Wes Craven's section also felt very forced, and the Chinatown story was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth looking at the good bits and has a strong finish. Sitting through the bad sections is not too painful - they last only 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
