I will never forget this movie or the events leading up to Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic, but must be told. Powers Boothe gives an upcoming performance as leader Rev. Jim Jones from turmoil to total madness. It would have won him an Academy Award easily if it was released in the theaters. It's the kind of mini-series you won't forget. You will not forget the pictures of the cult's brutality, control and obsession with its leader. His ascent and fall and the threat of the outside world to destroy what he meant to be paradise. The mass murder is terrible, almost unreal for anyone's imagination, why so many people (900+) voluntarily or against Jonas orders. They do not do mini-series like these, where we are back with the mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others.
