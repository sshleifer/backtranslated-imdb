The prerequisite for this anime series is about bread, of all things to base a plot on! I really laughed. The main character has a special bread production that he was born with and he goes out to the bread baking school. I wish it was available on DVD and it doesn't matter if it's subtitle or dubbed - it's so good. Even theme song alone is fun. At one point in the theme song, there is an African-Japanese man with an aphrodite on horses carrying a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These pictures will not make sense unless you see anime. You will laugh until your pages hurt. It's definitely the most unique anime I've seen so far.
