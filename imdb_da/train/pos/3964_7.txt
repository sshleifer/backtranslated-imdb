I found The FBI Story significantly entertaining and appropriately optimistic for my New Years Day vacation viewing. Its drama and action-packed episodes were exciting. The hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall, photography, script and direction were quite honest. Instead of taking the film to be a contradictory piece of propaganda, I liked it as a well-depicted depiction of the need for ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the portrayal of a family that held together under the burden of man's involvement in his (excusable) important work showed not to be a two representation but an ideal and exemplary one.
