This movie is great for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. There is a bold color theme through the film with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. A photo that looks very expensive (and probably not) completes the look. I always enjoy these stories that groups of misfits / loners come together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s, but this does not. This group of actors depicts really well-flawed, yet very sympathetic characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the road movie theme, I couldn't help but remember my favorite movie from last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and got a little annoyed a little by the Til Schweiger performance at times. The opening scene, all the scenes where they crush their tricks, are very fun. There is a mixture of humor and emotion throughout the film. I like the end a lot. And of course it's about the magician theme. A good magician makes the audience see where he wants them to create an illusion. As it happens, that's what a movie director does and that's why they call it movie magic.
