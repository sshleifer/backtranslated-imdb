This movie has great style, amazing visual and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. It falls at the end when the stories become a bit extreme .. but overall, I recommend this movie just because it has the good old Russian feel for it .. big, impressive, powerful, gloomy and brutal and knows at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty. PLOT: A guy who can get a knife to shoot out of his hand (not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer), since he is really crazy you are trying to get a girlfriend .. he discovers that after you have killing a person with your sword's hand, it's a little hard to keep a stable relationship .... <br/> <br /> The sword's boy is on the planet for a reason .. he just doesn't know what it is .. NOT . <br /> <br /> Lots of dark street battles with guys unexpectedly getting the fillet creative. <br /> <br /> RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles .. well worth a watch ..
