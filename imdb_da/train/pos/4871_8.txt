It requires a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of Zavet's situations, characters and jokes as well as many other Kusturica films. See, for example, the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech units defending the citizens' integrity and lifestyle, nostalgia for the good days of the Communist government, and the awakening of the young brat watching his naked teacher on the sound the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to depart Serbia's tragic history described in its previous films, but creates a whole world by itself in the process. This is not a political film or an explicit political film in any case. It's a fun movie before everyone. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this movie as in all its other films. His style is direct and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters, and we know he wants us to feel the same. The room he is developing melds to present, history and magic, and the colors seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> It's also not a perfect movie. The main error is the length, some editing and abbreviation would have been useful as at some point the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions. It's yet another of the most catchy, funny, moving movies I've seen lately.
