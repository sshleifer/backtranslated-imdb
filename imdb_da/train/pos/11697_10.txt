This movie was really eye-opening. I've seen this movie several times. Only when I was four did I actually remember it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the Director sends is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday life or just Plain going the extra mile to offend him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers alike!
