This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the Soviet Union's first known serial killer. I had voted in and just waited for half a decent TV movie, but found myself drawn by the convincing way the story was told. As others have said, there is much to admire here, which unfortunately lacks in many large screens. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit should go to Chris Gerolmo whose intelligent manuscript and direction draws the viewer into it until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. The action of the whole cast is also great, especially that of the two leads, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing depictions give their character arches great credibility, and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after Perestroika really reacts. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your crime movies with a little more depth and a little less shine, I highly recommend you look for 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
