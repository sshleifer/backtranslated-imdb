Only seen season 1 so far, but it's just amazing !! A wide range of people stuck on an island. No one is as they seem to be, and everyone seems to have lots of skeletons in their cabinets .... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so good? It's probably not, but then a spoonful of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a great "hello" and an island that's all you've ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmare and you'll be lost to. The story got so many turns and it is incredibly incredible. Well created, solidly working with a liberating acceptance that at the end of all is human (well almost everyone ... I believe ...) with good and bad sides. But weird oh so strange ...
