The fourth in the "Dirty Harry" series, this movie has one of the most despicable, ugly, unlikely, profane, obnoxious women I've ever seen in movies: "Ray Perkins," which Audrie Neenan played. She is the modern unpleasant living version of the 1945 "Detour" character, "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> Her bad mouth and grooming mode struck me so much, I've never seen this movie again until I've acquired a profanity filter that closes her up ... and at least some of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence follows immediately ..... within minutes! It happens so often, it's almost ridiculous, but it gives a fast and entertaining movie with a satisfactory ending, as all the scumbag villain is removed one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophomoric movie that appeals to our base instincts ..... and connects, sorry to say. Most of us like to see these goosebumps get it eventually, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
