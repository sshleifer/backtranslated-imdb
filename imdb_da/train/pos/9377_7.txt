A surprise thriller with multiple twists and crosses than a doodle pad. A large mold mixes it up with an exciting plot monitored by a Twin Peaks-ish influence in Director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great depiction of a man in a tie looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, like Dennis Hopper. It's such a shame that he never made a higher profile in biz. I'm sure he has his followers. All in all, it's a great movie that shows you don't need the big bang or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining movie.
