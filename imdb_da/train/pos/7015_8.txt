Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent that virtually gives the store away to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS Agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have all heard the line of an IRS Agent, "Hi, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then spread into a chuckle that says "Yes, right." As you get more and more into this story, you can't figure out this guy. He easily goes to those who are being audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much we want him to be our auditor if we are to get the audit. Hey, the IRS, are you listening? (fun, just fun) <br /> <br /> The speed of the movie is perfect and so much that tracks were ignored that would have told me what was really going on. Intense, repeat intense, focus was on Ben and remain there. The whole movie only works because of Ben when we try to find him out and I saw no trace (what do you suggest, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching DVD movies was the better way to go here. At the end of the movie, I finally joined the whole thing. Now it was obvious then. And yes, it's over the top, but still a great story, mainly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for the Best Actor Award. The rest of the casting was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's over the top and despite the big play, and when you finally get all the answers, realize that the movie's message is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you won't need many tracks to find out. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to be excited about. Mix. Emergency: No. Language: No.
