Synopsis for this movie does a good job of explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot. It was hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's direct debut, although some pictures look just like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> There are still a few shots that really look good and show some real fantasy on Paxton's side. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with some great twists in the end, several of them, all trustworthy, fun and best of all, immersed well enough to make them true phrases. <br /> <br /> The children's actors in the film also do well. I'm usually cautious about movies with children in the lead, because too often they come out as Nickelodeon rejects, but both of these kids do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it is very, very scary.
