This movie is fun to watch, doesn't have much of a plot (well, that's not a plot), but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at. The basic story is that Cheech is trying to have a nice date while Chong is partying with Cheech's cousin (they smoke dope, go to a music store, a massage parlor, a comedy club, and even go into some house they don't even know!
