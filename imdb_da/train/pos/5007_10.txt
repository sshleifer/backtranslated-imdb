Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply amazing! From her crap as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store - everything was top class! It was easy to understand how this special received honors. <br /> <br /> Not confused by the guest's appearance, the focus remained on Barbra about the whole production.
