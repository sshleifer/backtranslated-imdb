`Mad Dog 'Earle is back with his sad-sack minor Marie and the incredible clubfoot Velma. Then Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even stage-chewing mutt Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason to restore Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or frame and making it with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from it in original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters and so on down the credits.) The only change is that this time instead of black and white it is in Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who count this an improvement. <br /> <br /> I died thousands may be unnecessary ?? and inferior ?? but at least it is not a travesty; The story still works on its own stagy terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of the pen near Chicago, runs west to spear a huge job masterminded by the lunatic kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. ?? knock over a post mountain resort. Along the way, he almost collides with a family of Oakies when he is mated with their grandchildren; The infection stays even when he discovers that she is paralyzed. Arriving at the cottages, where the rest of the gang leans up, he finds amateur hotheads on each other's neck as well as Winters who throws himself at him (like pooch). Biding time until they receive a call from their inner man at the hotel, Palance (for winter's chagrin) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girls' deformity, a gesture that goes back. Then, the surgical strike towards the resort becomes a carnage. On the lamb, Palance moves higher into the cold Sierras .... It's an absorbing enough story, competently done, lacking the distinctive character, Walsh and his cast into it in 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and Sam Spades in it Maltese Falcon became a star. And a last heretic note: These mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
