In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler danced and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals who offered a depression from their honor. Gold Diggers from 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world by Broadway Theater with virtually the same theme for the show to continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films highlighted the kaleidopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, showing stop tunes and many of the same supportive players. Everyone is undoubtedly classics of their genre, but I have to admit a clear preference for Foot Lights because of it's pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William of Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter of 42nd Street unmistakably show off the production head - especially Baxter who burnt out Julian Marsh in search of a last checkout smash. However, both lack the Cagney's infectious energy, which perfectly complements the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind when he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging boyfriend. Of course, Cagney not only makes Footlight the classic one it is. The script crackles with some sharp double-threads delivered by a superlative support casting with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee, and especially Joan Blondell, who is all down to size. Busby Berkeley's dance figures are surreal, suggestive and risqu√© and are done just before the Hollywood Code's arrival in 34. Unfortunately, the thirties and once beyond will never see such a really low musical with enlistment and sass of footlight again. Gentility and morality provided for it.
