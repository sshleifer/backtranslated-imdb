This was a very enjoyable movie. A humorous but victorious look at the family and the obligations that come with it. The story of a man coming home from his life in the city to his father's bathhouse in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, even appreciate the very things he left home to get away from. The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
