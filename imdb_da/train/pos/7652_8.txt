The play-amazing. The story - amazing. Scripture - wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes it is slow and it has mostly spoken, but the whole story of all their life and how it is told with flashbacks thrown in and out, makes you listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story . I even read the book on which the film is based, and it has shown me even more light in this story and answers some questions left unanswered in the film. I will also read Exectioner's Song, which is the second half of the Gilmore story. This movie made me think so much about the term "peeping in the other side of the looking glass". You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is a punk band that wrote a song about how it would be to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) And as you listen to what after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you see the whole situation a little different if you were only here the song itself. This film opened my eyes that way and in many others. I highly recommend this movie (and the book).
