Man, I really love the new DVD that Universal put out. I've never seen THE SENTINEL see it well since I had to put up with crazy, grainy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, there is no option beyond a trailer that looks rather worse for wear. And avoid Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks. <br /> <br /> Whatever, disturbing fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves in haunted NYC brownstone, it's just more than just haunted. It's also a gateway to hell, and the Vatican holds an old-blind priest (John Carradine) to watch it and make sure the devils and archangels don't escape. <br /> <br /> This has an all star cast full of old-fashioned actors like Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc. as well as comedies of upcoming 80s stars, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (who's voice became mysterious overdubbed) and Tom Berenger. And you won't even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to do a double-take as I wasn't really located where I had seen him before. <br /> <br /> Beautiful-looking scenes of Alison cut the eye and nose of her dead father's decaying corpse, obsessed with the devil. And there is a nice ending, where disfigured, deformed people try to haunt Alison to commit suicide, so she won't be the next to guard the portal. It seems that Alison's troubled past makes her a leading Vatican candidate to become the next sentinel. <br /> <br /> An outstanding, eerie 70's classic by director Michael Winner, which should not be missed. I've also recommended it to those who want something a little more imaginative in addition to the usual stupid teenage slashers and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
