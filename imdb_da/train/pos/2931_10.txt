Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw it for the first time about 2 years ago, I was in stitches for weeks after that. To date I have seen it another 17 times, and I still laugh at my ass every time. For those who don't know Eddie Murphy, he was a brilliant stand-up comedian before being a Hollywood superstar. There is not a dull spot in this genius as opposed to Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987, which goes flat in the middle. If you are not the kind of person who cannot stand hard, then I will not advise you to see it as you will probably hear swords of one form every 5-10 seconds. I gave this a 10 out of 10 because it shows the greatest comic genius of them all at his best.
