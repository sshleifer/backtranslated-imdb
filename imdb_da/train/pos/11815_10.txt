At the time I write this I see over 15,000 votes, it has a 5.8 rating. There is something wrong with that picture. Personally, I give it a 10. I can see a 7 on the lowest or a possible 8 if it was judged by people who watch this movie for what it really is. It's a comic book hero movie. This movie won more than it's part of the prizes. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations .... just telling me it's better than a 5.8. Some great actors from some very good actors, some great special effects and, in my opinion, will be if not already a classic in the years to come. If you're looking for pure entertainment, be sure to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie you can see more than a couple of times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
