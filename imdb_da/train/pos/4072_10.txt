Hayao Miyazaki's name became prominent with Spitied Away, but what is often overlooked is the director's first film effort. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas instructed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 80's, and what was stuck with me was the visual lushness of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known store of Â£ 9 I couldn't resist but buy it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not match my memory of it (the memory is fun that way). <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with all the knowledge of artists' portfolios is how much like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud is of the artwork. I can only assume some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), her adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked part of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne, it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the last part having the heroes ending in Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the part that is strongest in my memory - the "pastoral" ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the many robots covered in moss under the giant tree. In my opinion, this is the highlight of the film - the views on the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanized underground. <br /> <br /> Though this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot that carpets the garden and animals. The end of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It's incredibly stylish, I don't want to say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a huge amount of detail in buildings, airships and design and appearance of almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and value it.
