This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it to anyone whose local video store owns it. Or better yet, you could buy it because chances are you will see this over and over again. I remember watching this movie as a kid, and that was good then. But having seen it again yesterday, I have found it to be fantastic. A good mix of comedy (though not as big as "Mr Magoo" - another of my favorites) and action. This deserves 10/10 and I hope they will soon make a sequel (fingers crossed). If you are doing childcare or are looking after babies for something, then I would recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :).
