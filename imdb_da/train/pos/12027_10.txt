I've seen it and I like it Melissa plays its part well. It was actually trustworthy. My brother-in-law saw it with my sister and I and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot it, it was based on a true story (I had seen it a few years ago.) He just said because it was in his lifetime you think is true & both my sister and i were like it was anyway, i wondered if anyone knew what murder it was or who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him. I love life movies especially those who are true or just those who learn a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can't remember where any help would be appreciated.
