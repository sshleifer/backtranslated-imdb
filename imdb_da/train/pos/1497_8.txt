This movie is a rather entertaining horror anthology movie (in step with Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. The movie must also be required viewing to Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third doctor) has an entertaining role as a rude and unpleasant horror star!
