myself and 2 sisters looked at all 3 series of Tenko and agree that this is far from the BBC's better series. The whole cast was very convincing in the parts they portrayed, and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower, it was convincing display and my evenings would not be the same without it. No doubt we will see it again, as it is a series that I would never get sick to see. Excellent viewing and full marks for the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting.First rate in all departments and will recommend this series to anyone, although some age limits have to be considered due to some adult material. So grateful to the BBC for publishing this series on DVD and Video.
