Without knowing this movie prior to seeing it on the Rialto Channel, I found it to be a comfortable, sharp and enriching movie. <br /> <br /> Casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places (but it's a movie). The way it looked and the cozy Turkish character went on until it got bad, as real life can and does. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was especially interested in watching this movie when it started because people are often laughing at her acting abilities (I find it pretty reasonable because she is always a solid actress in my opinion). I loved a little at the end where Andy's character said "sometimes I feel he was never here" etc, it was so quite how it really is in such a situation (which I personally can identify with), so there was the beautiful classic piece "Nocturne" I think of Chopin, which was a beautiful way to finish (wore the bright comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary). I say "well done" to the filmmakers - I've seen 1,000 s of worse movies!
