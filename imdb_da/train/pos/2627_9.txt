Finally Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... 'Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is an irreverent new experience on a classic story. What classic story do you ask? Why, "The Lion King" of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there's one thing that Disney is never short of, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean this is not a good movie. It is basically the events of 'The Lion King' that told from Timon and Pumba's perspective. And this is because you have to know the story of 'The Lion King' with your heart to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, at one level I looked at this and thought "Oh my god, it's so boring ..." and on another level I had a ball. Much of humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumbaa makes up two beds, one big for himself and one small for Timon, within the first nanosecond, we all know that Timon is going to take the big one. But it doesn't stop being fun, as the IMO is 'Hakuna Matata' in a nutshell. That's not what happens, that's how it is. <br /> <br /> And a warning: There are also some white chicks. Are you expecting something else in a movie where Pumbaa takes the center? But as speed skipping goes, these are particularly good and should satisfy even the most special know. <br /> <br /> The recurring talent is amazing. I'm a little surprised that some of the players were willing to come back, what about most of those who only have two or three lines (if lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is also amazing. From 'Digga Tunnah' in the beginning to 'That's All I Need', an adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song cut from 'The Lion King' and honestly improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me nothing to complain about at all. <br /> <br /> Finally, Timon and Pumbaa are great characters, and while it can be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and different compromising situations, so. It is rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> Do I start to sound incredible? <br /> <br /> Whatever, 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'The Lion King' too many times. Especially if you are thinking right now, "Don't be stupid, it's not that you see" The Lion King "too many times!"
