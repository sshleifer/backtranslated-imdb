With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to be aware, but if you do, you'll probably find much to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with travel time. A virus killed many people back in 1997, and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) sent back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and taken to a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe in him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while being chained and locked in a room and seen again in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe in Cole's stories. <br /> <br /> The movie is constantly playing over time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is retrieved in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, someone appears only seconds after the phone call. That's how it happens throughout the movie, and therefore you need to be aware. You can ask some questions, but since you can't answer, it's better to agree with the movie. 'Twelve Monkeys' acts as a sci-fi with some beautiful images and a dark atmosphere, and it seems like a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next and it helps the movie. Maybe it has some flaws in history, but since it's about a fictional thing like traveling on time, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.
