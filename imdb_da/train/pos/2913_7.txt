"This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have stated, a rare and well-felt look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attacks. And the movie in the various NAS locations gives a valuable glimpse to a type of aviation that is far away. The first half of the film, however, is only about Beery, his relationship with his service columns, and he meets with the Tom Drake character and his mother and got Drake's legs attached. Only then will the second movie start. The other movie is mostly LTAs in action, takes on a surface underneath, guys are killed and much damage is caused. The look is pretty brave and realistic, I imagine. Then we change to Southeast Asia. Did Navy have LTAs there? Not against this part is really wild, with a blimp that is used to extract some downed airmen from the jungle. And the japs ​​shoot like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except escape is oh, so relaxed. This is a blimp we are talking about. Ultimately, a feeling-good WWII dramatizes about a very unusual part of the war.
