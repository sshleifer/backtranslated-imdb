And so the biggest TV comedy started! It's been 12 years since the very first episode, but it has been with the same spirit until last season. Because it is here, "Friends" is based on quotes. Extraordinary situations occur among six friends who will never leave our hearts: Thank you very much to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe !!! In our first meeting, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the "perfect guy" (there is no perfect guy why all your women are obsessed with it?)? and how your marriage can be destroyed when the partner in your life discovers she is a lesbian until we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes ... NOW FRIENDS!
