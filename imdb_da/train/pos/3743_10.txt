Tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of places .... Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man at the center of a new murder investigation that may have just committed a similar murder earlier. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moral and emotional journey that takes place with his character (Ben Turner) and cuts the journey Amanda Burton has made. Inevitably, they cross over ... Who did what? <br /> <br /> The study of why, both in the past and in the present, rather than the WHO could have given a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who complains? <br /> <br />
