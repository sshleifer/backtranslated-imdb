Cure uses voice over to create an intimate mood. Although VO accounts for all of the film's lines, it does not completely detract from the visual history. The use of multiple film stores adds a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to improve the leap in time. The ending will make you jump despite the fact that you can predict the result. I especially enjoyed the excitement of the movie's excitement. The close-ups of the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but performs a lot. The tight editing really helps show what a short movie can do. Worth seeing more than once!
