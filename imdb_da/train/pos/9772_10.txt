Theodore Rex may be the greatest cinematic experience all the time, and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel harmonizes with the great filmmakers of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing short of breathtaking, and doing some work by Spielberg looks tired and elementary. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the filmmaking line to levels never expected of filmmakers. The concept of making not just a movie with a dinosaur, but adapting an action-packed, exciting detective novel that co-stares a "talking" dinosaur with a post-modern name like "Theodore" and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know the. The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. Seeing Theodore Rex is very akin to looking at God's face and hearing him say "you are my most beloved creation." This is one of the few movies that is simply to die for !!!
