This movie is harmless escapist fun. Something the recent Tomb Raider movie was missing. I can't wait to get the DVD. How can people give this a low score and still go and see the Titanic without a guilty conscience, I do not know. Everything with Karen Kopins in her underwear has to judge an extra point or two!
