I was totally engrossed in this movie from the first to the last minute. It's great shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and applied techniques. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked by both friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at the workplace, with her true intention is to find love. He is an ex-con and she exploits him to avenge those who have harmed her. In return, she has to help him with a hoist that requires her reading skills to pull it off. The movie is in a dark film noir, with a couple of really excellent scenes and an even better final. The right beauty in this movie comes from the way the director exploits the handicap of the leading person. Using sound keeps the voltage consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keep the blood in the pump, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual oppression, you've got it a great movie. That's the kind of movie Hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.
