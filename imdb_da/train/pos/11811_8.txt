Dick Tracy was originally a cartoon created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a herd of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters like Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in their 40s that Warner Bros. created their own tag on Tracy-style villains in such comics as Daffy Duck). Tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up-to-date technology advancement (especially the wrist watch communicator), which earned their fair share of screen time on this outstanding movie. The music was performed wonderfully by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the highlight of his career. It's strange, because when you watch the movie and see the exciting moments, the movie feels as much as Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound to his pieces. <br /> <br /> I love the hard-talking child Pacino plays as the Big Boy Caprice (and the garden!), Madonna takes evil, and movies and director were impeccable. This film was very professionally made and has tons of great actors known as great actors for some time before this film was made (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O 'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, who was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a past life or something because he really fits the part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8/10 to everything it brought to the movie theater that was overlooked (for whatever reason). There have been many misunderstandings about the assessment of this movie on IMDb and I still don't understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, like the style of the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting and everything in this movie. Go buy it today. You won't be sad.
