I was really excited to watch this movie. I finally thought that Australia had made a good movie .. but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt on a slasher movie ever. I'm sorry that Molly Ringwald had to come all the way to Australia to make a horrible movie. The action was horrible (especially the Australian guy who tried to speak in an American accent) and the plot was also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this movie, came out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheese film "Staff" in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slip If it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> WARNING !!! MAJOR SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the end. I was expecting a big surprise about who the murderer was ... but the killer was not even human .. who made this realistic slasher film into a horrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
