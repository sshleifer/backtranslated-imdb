I saw the description of the movie on TCM and just let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was very surprised to find out I really liked the movie and found it quite unusual. Of course it is seriously dated, but as a piece it is worth looking at just the subtle humor in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now, the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can see it more often. I was also quite concerned with the performance of Smith and Ustinov as the leaders, and of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the comedy performance of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
