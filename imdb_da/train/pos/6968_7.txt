Like the new BSG was not what fans of the original series expected, Caprica could not deliver what fans of the new BSG expected (mostly). It is a very interesting, if not self-interested, show, or at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the big CGI voltage in the (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you liked the drama, you will probably find something you like and maybe even identify with. <br /> <br /> The Storylin explores how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hates them and the origin of a monotheistic society. The authors also manage to deal with people who play God (s) 'and the creation or recreation of human life. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. <br /> <br /> I found it to be looting together in some parts and also preaching in others, but overall it was promising. A small part of me wants (or hopes) there may be some minor inclusions of BSG in there (except for the back story I mentioned), but that would probably cause the story too much. Like BSG, I have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me, but it's too early to tell. It would really be easy to criticize this as a mistake if you compare it to previous series, but I'm willing to give it a try. All in all I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the (linguistic) towel'.
