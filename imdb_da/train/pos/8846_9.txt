I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet. The best word I could come up with to describe it is crazy. It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start rolling at the end. Believe me, this movie will keep you guessing all the way through. <br /> <br /> The story is very well built and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story. The action is all fantastic from all the leaders and even the small parts, excellent cast. I also loved the filmmaker, it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film. It was all good. <br /> <br /> This movie is tense, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to see, but you'll be glad you did.
