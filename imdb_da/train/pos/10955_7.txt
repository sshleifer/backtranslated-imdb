I originally scored Sarah's show with a good fat 8, but I've struggled a little with her humor too late and a thin 7 is what is settled. I'll explain. <br /> <br /> You will either like Sarah's humor or you will not. If you don't, I doubt anyone could persuade you. You know who you are and that is just fine, but then you know it too. By moving forward, the first season gave us amazing things about Sarah, her friends and family, and her life's pursuits. In a memorable episode she is "pulled over" by Officer Jay, whom she meets for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm here?" he asks. "Because you got all C's in high school?" she answers quizzically. It seemed to be a real question. - It's funny stuff in my book. Sarah can come at you from odd angles. In another episode, her affair with God was extremely fun. God is petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke. It's wise it's a twisted view, but she would show us the truth in humor and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Even though we still have no new and inventive comedy, we seem to have beaten something in trite poop and speed jokes, simply. I get some good laughs here and there, but much of it works as a filler, while she and the authors struggle to capture some original material. Sophomoric and tiring are the emotions I have for the episodes lately, but I have struck it for the gems I find (the turtle) and waiting for her to turn it around. I was a fan of her "Jesus is Magic" routine and would like to believe I understand what she is capable of. Let's get back to it.
