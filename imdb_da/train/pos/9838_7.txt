Born again is an okay episode of season 1. In my opinion, the reincarnation bit is cool. The more I see it, the more I like it, but it will never rise above "Very Good" for me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as the reincarnation episode. Anyway, now I want to say what is good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh Yeah! <br /> <br /> The fish tank was lovely. =] <br /> <br /> Turned out of a window. Very classic. x] <br /> <br /> The bad: Marry your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to reincarnate. Why did the guy who died by having his scarf be interwoven, wearing his scarf instead? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable. 10.7
