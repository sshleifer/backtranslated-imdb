Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986, 1984 movie Beat Street is undoubtedly the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger breakdancing brother, a graffiti artist, and a wanna-be showbiz promoter through a winter, trying to break out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The play is not always up to each other, and the characters are not fully drawn, but they are more compensated than by down-to-earth dialogue, a plausible story, amazing dance sequences and a timeless hip hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this movie was shot at the birthplace of breakdancing ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!") And includes appearances from the fathers of breakdancing, dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Africa Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew gives the best scene in the movie as they dominate a dance stroke at the premiere breakdancing club in the 80s, Roxy. A must see for hip-hop lovers.
