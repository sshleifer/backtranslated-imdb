Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" movie, and I thought this kind of description might have been a cliché. But like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike brands are here, the violence, the black humor, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the hard to suffer central character. Shinjuku, however, is one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he thinks is that the film has a really captivating energy and raw edge that seems so fresh that even though he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie, he couldn't repeat or improve the purity of this movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is completely visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings complemented by a stunning scene where a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (Only a Miike movie can let you get away with a sentence like that.) The movie has a great pace, unlike Dead or Alive, which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly worried about the relationship between Japanese and Chinese in the post-war era, and this emotional issue is well dealt with here and the central character really comes to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can't sing Shinjuku's praise enough. I don't want to give away too much. This is Miike before he started using CGI to animate his films and almost remind him of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The key figures are superbly decorated, and the final twist guarantees that once the movie is finished, you will pop it back on again to work it all together.
