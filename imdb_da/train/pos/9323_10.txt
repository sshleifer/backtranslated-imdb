For me, this movie was powerful. I don't want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend many years ago; we were like brothers. This movie brought back some living memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason I could not put my vote for this movie which would have been a 10. I kept getting a message like "No votes have been placed ..." And yet I saw in the statistics that there was. Will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Minor mistakes I overlooked. It was the relationship between the characters that got me. Beautifully traded and real situations. I've been in a couple of them. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie. Like "Spring Forward" is another overlooked gem. I am very happy that movies like these are still being made; about relationships between people, well-written, sensitive and first-class plays and direction. After all, it's not what it's all about?
