Here I thought "Nanook of the North" was the last word in archaic semi-doc 'eskimo' film. How wrong! As an avid sea kayaker, I stayed up to 330 am to see this hoping to catch a glimpse of some handmade 'shipwrecks'. The movie didn't let me down. Any student of kayak / umiak construction should look here. (Note to colleagues SKERS: They seem to use Norton Sound kayaks with single blade paddles). <br /> <br /> But the film went far beyond this rather narrow interest. Although there have been some small back-shot fakey bits that others have noticed, the film has so much heart, they are just a minor annoyance. It was (from this very amateur anthropologist's point of view) the perfect time to make this movie. Early thirties: "talkies" are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually let Inuit speak in their own tongue. And there is so much that was, despite the infused melodrama, authentic. They are really whacking the polar bear, the whale and the caribou. A fifty version of this movie would have been so cheesy with 'stars', technicolor, etc. To chew it up. The 1970s version? Not even. A very good companion to this excellent movie is "White Shadows in the South Sea" (1928). The specter of "Eskimo" is also geographically about the relentless and profound disturbance of Western culture / technology of an unsuspecting people.
