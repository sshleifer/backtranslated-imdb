Beautiful movie that in just eight minutes shows an unusual genre mix: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we are allowed to tell the story: a girl enters a European cafeteria and then ... Soft transit from the nonsense's mystery to narrative logic. In no time did Vigalondo not succeed in the B / W by imagination and despite (thanks to) the strictest budgets. <br /> <br /> Due to the time frame, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, fast poetry in B / W (¿Remember the early Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> A must see to reassure our beliefs at a young movie theater outside the states.
