While reading through the commentary on this show, I couldn't help but notice that a large percentage of reviewers had not seen any episodes of the show completely or completely or by their own free will. Things at Kerching! Is it a children's program, FOR CHILDREN so obviously if your elderly it will seem cheesy, forced and probably stupid. I even found someone who said the sets were stupid, but I remember as an eight-year-old wondering why Taj had ikea icecube molds on his wall and also wondered if my parents would let me keep some in my ( they did not). Yes, it can be annoying, the play can be better, and some of the characters do really strange things with their hair, but as a children's program, I consider it 10/10. Compared to the things they fly in their place today, well, let's just say I wish it would be re-aired. DVD release, anyone?
