'Holes' was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talked to said they LOVED it. All casts fit the part they had and Shia Labeouf really has a future with plays. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was exactly how I imagined her. anyone who has not seen it, I recommend it and I guarantee you will "dig it".
