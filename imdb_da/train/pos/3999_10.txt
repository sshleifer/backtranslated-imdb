I'm embarrassed to say I missed "The Mother" when it was in theaters. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave it a 10 vote, one of the few I've given here. This English independent is filmed with such great care and quality. It made me relentless. The story, low-key and purely human, is brutally honest and completely absorbent, thanks to the actors Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The kinematics are amazing. The result is heavily connected to the plot. The story is epic, brilliantly dressed by author Hanif Kureishi in earthly life. This story deals with major problems with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of the big problems are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of prizes won, despite many nominations. It's simply one of my all-time favorite movies.
