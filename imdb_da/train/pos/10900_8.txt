This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I definitely went on to see the repetition. I really sympathized with the film's main character, for it is true, I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes entertaining and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disease. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a child (because of wasting vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see his terrible condition and he removes his bandages. Jonny had quite a cheeky sense of humor, he even told beyond the grave when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story using his mother, Edna Kennedy, his elder brother and celebrity model, and Jonny's follower, Nell McAndrew. It won BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director (Factual), and it was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. One should see the documentary!
