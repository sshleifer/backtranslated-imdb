I can't believe they took it out of the air. Especially since they only had several episodes left. My daughter, sister and a couple of my friends loved seeing this show. We were so sad when they stopped showing this because of so-called ratings. It is not reasonable for the people who saw this show since the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I wish they would take a total vote of all people with a mood system three times a year. They could send papers in the mail and we, as viewers, could give a total vote on all programs that we see or heard about. This can also help promote a new show. People wanted to see it and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what viewers see, you can also use this as a free TV and cable advertising tool. We'll see the other episodes. Bring it back !!
