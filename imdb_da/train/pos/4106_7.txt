This is certainly not the intellectual film with deep mission, so I really do not think there is too much not to understand if you are not Czech. It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, pretty funny and sometimes a little sick. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so the authors are. But it doesn't matter, the genre is really different, and these two movies should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh, and there is a chance that it will succeed. <br /> <br /> Not bad movie, not the brilliant, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
