Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and was not intended to be a sequel to demons, which Lamberto Bava even mentions it on the interview at Sheirk Show DVD, but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music of Demons and Demons 2 was 80s rock music while it is more eerie music, and while the first two were gory horror Demons III: Ogren is an architectural horror, so it is that demons III are not a proper successor to demons, but I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is scary and it adds a tone to the castle where the movie is set. Ogre is another thing why I like the movie. There are two other films classified as Demons III and these are Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: Ogre is a good movie as long as you don't compare it to demons and demons 2.
