I just saw this night it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It's a pretty remarkable movie. The filmmakers literally stumble into the story and were there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves right in the middle of the events when the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and mostly the story unfolds as it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological perspective (as they clarify), but they stay in the background and instead try to focus on the events, the people and the background and the story leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not groundbreaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think it should be. What we get to see what 'embedded' journalism really should be. What we see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares about his people ... a story of power and greed as a coalition of business / military / media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader ... and outstanding access to a historical event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
