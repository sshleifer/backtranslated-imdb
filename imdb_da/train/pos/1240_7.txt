Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends his time finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters her life, she tells him he is the one chosen and he has to find the golden child. Skeptically and solely driven by desire and intrigue, Jarrell becomes involved without realizing that he is about to begin a great journey, one involving danger and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is The Golden Child a Product of Its Time? By that, I mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audience? For I remember alive how much this movie entertained people back in the decade, it was $ 79,817,937 ticket office, making it the 8th largest earner in 1986, but since the 80s dropped from memory it has become the thing to deny the Eddie Murphy pictures comedy awards they actually once had. The Golden Child is not aware of the more accepted 80's Murphy images as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but after traveling the movie recently, I personally find that it contains Murphy by his wisecracking, quipping and charming best! seriously! <Br /> <br /> The action of a fantasy action formula that was revived and temporarily by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981 hits The Golden Child all the necessary genre buttons. Beautiful girl, daring reluctant with a twig in his arsenal, dashing villain {Charles Dance so I could kiss him himself}, wonderful color and a sweet child with mysterious powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and uncover its worth as a cranial fantasy image. Yes, the CGI daemon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site then you can just take this genre also seriously, seriously. 10.7
