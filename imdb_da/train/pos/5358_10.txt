This is one of the amazing films from the 80s in my collection that I think all the time. <br /> <br /> Running Man is one of Arnold's best and most diverse films, even today and when I first saw The Running Man, I was so excited to watch a movie like this. I just love all the games and it's really a special movie. It also has Jesse Ventura, the legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. who seem to be dead in his movie because he has were killed in such films as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and among others. All Arnold fans should love this movie from the beginning to the end, because its action-packed, star-filled, and one is the one of Arnold's best to date!
