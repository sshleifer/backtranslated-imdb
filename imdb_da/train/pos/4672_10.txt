I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are good as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from Alaska's parole back to his family in Brooklyn. He turns out there because his brother has died and he begins a journey of slowly repairing his alien relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. History takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand deeper understanding of the complexity of their lives. The image of the woodworking industry and the Brooklyn background also sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
