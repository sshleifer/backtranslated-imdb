Definitely a very good idea, manuscript was just OK. May have been better. The positives are that it does not drill you if you are an adventure lover, A new idea of ​​Atlantis lost the world. The negatives are that I personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this. It was not bad at all, but it would have been much better with some more runtimes. It was a great pleasure, but cant say it was boring or not good. A good one for those people who like adventurous animations like Sindbad, like The Road to El Dorado. This film is also recommended for people who are looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice ending.
