One reviewer states that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, he is moving. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in film. More than a triple threat that could act, write, and lead, had a genius that was uniquely suited to movies. One might consider whether he would have been a painter at an earlier age. This film definitely enhances this impression. A musician, a theater actor, a legacy of Shakespeare? hard to know but I'm very grateful to his time camera with movies and he has got him caught on film. I like the accent. I like the face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his movies and wish there was more. I especially love how other actors interacted with him on film. Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was oh there. Even at the end, when his beauty was destroyed, he was perhaps impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in. Rita was a beautiful blonde - a Lana Turner looked, but perhaps even more gracious and even that eye goes to Welles and one wants another moment, another movie, another hour in his company. Therefore, we all want us to come across the lost scrap that has been cut from his film because we know that we all know that there is no part of him that is not worthy of our time. See it and be grateful for the chance.
