How did I get into it: When I started to see this series on Cartoon Network, I have to say that I have never seen anything like this, and that was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS, and later the DVD of Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was amazing and really worth seeing. It had a lot of exploding actions that will blow you out of your place. And of course, the theme songs "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions were the best. Grades and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. My favorite Gundams in the show that I could Most like is Wing Zero and Epyon, and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. The Importance of Show: What this series also tells us that war is really very hard, and we can sometimes win or lose, but peace can also be difficult to achieve, and I think the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to achieve world peace. <br /> <br /> But this show is really the best of the best, so in the end of this review , watch the movie Endless Waltz after you've seen this show.
