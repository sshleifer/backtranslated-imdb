Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he throws himself into each of the characters he plays, makes them real. I remember many years ago we had a party in our house - friends came by, we sat around the table, eating, drinking the wine, talking and laughing - well. The TV was on - there was a movie we didn't pay much attention to. So suddenly we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not sound, the forks did not move, the food was cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young curly man, whose entire body was against him and who only controlled his left foot, took a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed eternity to write only a word on the floor. When he finished writing one word, we all knew that we had not witnessed one but three triumphs - triumph of a human will and spirit, the cinema's triumph which could capture the moment on the movie and triumph of a actor who did not act but who became his character. Jim Sheridan's "my left foot" is a key, non-sentimental biotradian about Christy Brown, the man born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love for her life. <br /> <br /> I like every one of the Day Lewis performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I think his greatest role was Christy Brown in "my left foot"
