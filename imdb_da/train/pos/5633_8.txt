Farrah Fawcett is amazing in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape a robber's coup. Well done to Farrah for being a nomination of the Golden Globe 'Best Actress. <br /> <br /> When she battered Joe (amazingly played by James Russo) coming into her home, she shares with her two roommates (who is comfortable!), Marjorie must play along with your scary demands. It gives some disturbing and shocking pictures! <br /> <br /> When her roommates come home, they are amazed (at least) by Marjorie's actions and a great show by Alfre Woodard, who desperately tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and make him the police, do the film even more nail-biting. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid quite annoying, but when Joe finally admits he came there to kill them all, it makes the movie a very emotional piece of drama. All in all, Extremities is an excellently thought-out and well-functioning movie, and I must have seen it hundreds of times now! Well done to everyone involved.
