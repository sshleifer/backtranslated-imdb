I got the movie in a month ago and I'm now a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore's. I love a happy ending and this movie gives a brilliant one with the truth in the Red Sox wrapped up! It's about a mathematics teacher who takes some promising children on a mathematical trip to a company where the successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This then leads to Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it's not easy when he admits he's a massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's fine, but then his baseball gets in the way of Lindsey's life. It's all fine in the end and it took a shot to get Drew running across the field !! I got it to two quid in Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you see some more of Drew's work as Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new movie with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics.
