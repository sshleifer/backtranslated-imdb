I started riding horses quite recently, and as anyone who has ever ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse-related material as I could, and I was surprised at the results. What I expected was a good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. What I got was a great movie filled with beautiful scenes and animations and a great story that has the great potential to warm one's heart. <br /> <br /> Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, if the whole world is crumbling around him when he discovers that humans are slowly taking over their homeland. The story unfolds with a large number of characters, some people, some animals, all are well written and most are comfortable to see on the screen. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and who has an appreciation for history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but what I feel is important is that the animals in this movie don't speak. This was a really good holiday from Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone is used to today.
