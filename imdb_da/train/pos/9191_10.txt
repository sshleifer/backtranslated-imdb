Okay, I didn't get purgatory stuff the first time I saw this episode. It looked like there was something significant that I couldn't put my finger on. This time, the Costa Mesa fires on television really ate my attention - and it helped me just write an essay on Inferno! But let me see what has NOT been discussed yet ... <br /> <br /> A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 stairs to crash due to the broken elevator. Yes, 7 is a significant number for many reasons, especially religious, but here is one more for you. On a hunch I consulted wikipedia, and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels? Purgatorio. Exclusive ante-Purgatory and Paradise. (Things at the bottom of the stairs and ... what Tony can't get to.) <br /> <br /> On the alleged "random" monk-slap scene. As soon as the monks appeared, it fits perfectly with Tony, who tries to get out of the scab. You can tell he was worried when the Christian commercial (death, disease, and sin) came on and he is becoming more and more desperate because the Christian sky looks a little beautiful. When he meets the monks, he thinks, "Hey, maybe these guys can help me?" That sounds like considering other religions (eg, Buddhism) and wondering if another way could take him to "salvation". Not that Tony necessarily literally thinks of becoming a Buddhist, but it seems that Finnerty tried it (and destroyed). The flap of the face basically tells Tony that there is no quick fix - as in no, you can't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here. <br /> <br /> Originally, Tony wasn't too worried about going to heaven. But at the "conference entrance" he understands that it doesn't get that easy for him. First I saw the name vs. The driving problem, when Tony had led a double life, what about the killing people and sleeping on it, that he was secret from most people. He feels free to have an affair with quasi-Melfi because "he's Kevin Finnerty". He shows that he can fool some people with KF's cards, like hotel dealers, but it won't get him out of Purgatory. These helicopters - heaven's helicopters? - Keep an eye on him and everything he does. <br /> <br /> After reading all the theories of "inFinnerty", it appears that KF's identity is a reminder of the infinite variety of paths Tony could have taken in his life. Possibly along with car joke involving Infiniti it's not sensible for me otherwise. Aaaand then my brain jumps out.
