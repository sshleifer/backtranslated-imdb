The only reason I didn't give this 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, extras, etc. But if you've ever had a dream of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream don't let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most life-conscious movies I've ever seen. And magical. The action is amazing, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of the films that "cult" status used to be about. I have recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love it, some can't finish it. When I think or feel something is impossible, I think of Alan Arkin's role in this movie. Sure he wanted to make more movies.
