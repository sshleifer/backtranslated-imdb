It is great to see that Shane Meadows already exerts international influence - LES CONVOYEUR'S ATTENDANT shares many themes with a ROM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the vague class identity of the work, but far below the center, the uninhibited father, the abandoned urban environment, the adult feelings of failure, the hardly hidden fascism that supports modern city life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an expert formalist, Mariage acts in pictures, and his coolly complex, exquisitely surrealistic, monochrome framework serves to remove the ugly and rather gloomy subject that Meadows-like is from. high farce for tragedy within seconds. <br /> <br /> There are longue and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is convincingly sour, a common man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realize them are dangerously dangerous; while individual set-pieces - popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best marriage sequence since the dead and the mortal - manages to push epiphany from despair.
