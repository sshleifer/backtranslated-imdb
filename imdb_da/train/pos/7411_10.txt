The key to the joy and beauty, the pain and the sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is basically what it is so that we do not constantly fight against the only convincing truth. That way we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us to understand. In this movie, the instructor shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful yet simple story, more of a fable that plays very well. Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than just watching actors. <br /> <br /> I was struggling to write a review of this fine movie so others would be motivated to watch it. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in a bathhouse. It sounds like a real turn off, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title for this movie is The Shower, but it is almost a contradiction to a great theme element in this bathing movie. I'm still lost. Talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice. <br /> <br /> So I just want to tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was. I was also totally entertained. I used deeply for the characters, and I was deeply concerned about what happened to them. For any story, it is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you were moved by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, make sure you see The Shower. Netflix has it, and DVD video and sound quality are excellent. I saw it in the original lanquage with well-executed and well-placed English bases. <br /> <br />
