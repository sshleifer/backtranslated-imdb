This show has a great story! It is very trustworthy! A man's wife dies, and he can't take care of his children alone, so he calls on his brother-in-law to be his best friend and many others come later on the show. Such as Rebeecca Donaldson, the lovable, yet strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alex you can find out for yourself (I don't want to spoil it for you) and to force Kimmy Gibler! (The devil of the DJ), but the kids are also wonderful. This is Mary Kate and Ashley took off first! And also you can know Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and it's so raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph the loving middle child who feels out of the evening. Really this is a very good show!
