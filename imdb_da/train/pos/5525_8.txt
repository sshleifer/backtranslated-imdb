Much of the problem that many people have with this movie is that they seem to think the story should have been more entertaining (ignoring it is based on a true story) or ranting against a movie that glorifies Che (which it really doesn't ). This movie is very close to Jon Anderson's final bio on Che and gets the story right. Soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was Che's Bolivian adventure. You really get the impression of the Bolshund's total reassurance and confusion about Che's revolutionary ideas or the difficulties his men face hunger and terrain. Sorry to drill the attentive challenged movie fan out there, but that was the way it happened. So don't go into this movie expecting a Rambo shoot em up, it's a true story!
