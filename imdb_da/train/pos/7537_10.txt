Contrary to what those who hate Christianity, 700 Club gives true answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments and a different view than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is best. Unlike other programs that provide social and belief-related comments, those behind the 700 Club help help those in need, such as Feeding the Hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical care to those living in poverty-stricken societies and giving hope to those in need of hope. It is not at all hateful. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest reaching the remote control and turning the channel on your TV. I do the same when I find CNN Headline News or for that matter programs that I find asked or offensive. What I find offensive is the way in which the ABC family inserts the disclaimer that the views of the 700 Club do not reflect ABC Family.
