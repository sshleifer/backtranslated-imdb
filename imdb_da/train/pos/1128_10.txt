Although the recent story of part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was entertaining once, "Iphigenia" with the incandescent Irene Pappas is a breathtaking one. Exploitation in natural surroundings with Greek actors who speak their own language gives such authenticity. One chance meeting with this movie on one of DirecTV's many movie channels kept me interested despite my concentration issues. There is no glitter or "bling" in this movie, just a fabulous rich story that is impeccably told by actors, so genuine you feel they are canceling a real family in turmoil. I think Homer himself, if he really existed, would be proud of this story. <br /> <br /> JLH
