An interesting thriller who has Paul Winfield as a detective on the murder case. Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease, it was hard to tell the man even appeared. Perhaps best known by younger viewers as voice / narrator of "City Confidential", Winfield ends his career with a so-called movie; but as always, Winfield shines. A good experience. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is good, Erika Eliniak, nice to look at, but leaves much to be desired in the functioning department. Although fair, this is a better bet. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: a watchable thriller that must not miss a Paul Winfield fan. A decent phone to send Paul Winfield to the celluloid sky. What an actor. He will be missed.
