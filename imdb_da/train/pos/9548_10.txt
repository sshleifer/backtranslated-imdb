It's an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Good work from the brothers in Gokbakar. First of all, I would like to point to plays. Generally, the screen shot in most movies from Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best shot to say "perfect". And also the transition parts are really excellent. On the other hand, "Gen" has a good topic that affects everyone. Especially a woman who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanitarium has a mother who is a common mental illness. Basic causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you need to do is combine all the hints. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive aggression of Doga Rutkay and the Sahan Gokbakar game. This performance may be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie you get confused"
