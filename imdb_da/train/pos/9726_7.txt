Well it was a wonderful surprise. its trailer did not predict a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. Part of Jeff Bridges in particular was a positive surprise, well written, sardinian and fun. However, less real, I don't think a guy who came where he got would show signs of such irreverence to everything his current company stands for. You do not become a top suit just to doubt it all over again. The end of the movie, while viewing Dolce Vita, was too corny, clich√© and quite disappointing. And of course, a guy like Pegg's character won't be past his first week in a flash New York magazine like this. I hope one day I will see a proper role written for Megan Fox, here she saw a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I can't see why she's this year's "sex symbol", I see hot girls on almost every cover on each leaf.
