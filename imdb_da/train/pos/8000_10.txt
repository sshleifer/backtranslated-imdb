... do not read any plot of plot because the plot may seem trivial, brain-dead and meaningless. The movie is excellent and it is performed by both Denzel and Dakota (she wants to go sky high, trust me) is just fabulous and the plot is mind-set. In fact, "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The movie is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictitious, a fact that adds the shock I had during and after the movie. If you love both actors and some horrible movies, you still haven't seen your favorite yet ... Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The movie is great, watch it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... just don't miss it
