I like this movie, though I don't really like James Belushi much. In this movie you can actually see several big names in the climb, namely Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine was already big of course. The basis of this movie is simple; It's like the shooting door movie. However, it was told in a light hearted way, and I like the comedy moments in it. It has made me try to revive my own important moments alive, eg what if I took the girl off a movie and not the other, etc. It tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives If some minute details were to change. It also reminds us to be careful about what we want. Life is not always as good on the other hand as we think; Perhaps what we have now is the best thing for us, all taken into account.
