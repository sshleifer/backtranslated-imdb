Chloe is mysteriously rescued from Dr. Caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with abilities from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, and a fraction of seconds later comes Clark. He finds that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville, and they meet at Kent Farm. When Bart is captured by Lex during a burglary at a LuthorCorp facility, Clark discovers that the Green Arrow also employed Bart (a.c. impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate the Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invite Chloe to join their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode so far in this 6th season. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the joining of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular and completes the necessary organization for teamwork. Ultimately, Oliver breaks up with Lois based on the importance of fighting criminals and Lex's secret labs around the world. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
