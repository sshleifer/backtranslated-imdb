Really, I liked it. The prerequisite was good, the story fits where both respective series went, and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a particular series and then refuse to talk about it or make possible reunions (an example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she would be thrilled to make another movie, and then Mary said the same later, so I would be looking for someone else ... but if it doesn't quite work so they can relay it.
