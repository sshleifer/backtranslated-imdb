The Sopranos were probably the last best show for air in the 90s. It's sorry it was the best show on HBO, if it wasn't on TV, not everything was spelled for you all the time you had to think it was brilliant. the casting was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and played his character excellently as well as the others. Every character had errors that made them so real and made the viewers connect with them, and that was one reason why it was so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take it. Many different things can be interpreted by the final id as believing that Tony did not die, but meadow went in and sat down with them and that blackout was just for excitement. Tony will have to go to court and handle it hopefully not dead, that's how I feel ... Long live the Soprano and Tony Sopran .......
