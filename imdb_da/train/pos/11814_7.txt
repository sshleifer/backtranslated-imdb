When we use the word "escapist", we usually mean it negatively; Warren Beatty's big screen version of "Dick Tracy" proves that "escapist" can be good. This is really an entertaining movie. As the eponymous, yellow-faced, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective that we can all refer to: ready for action but not without his weaknesses. From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world for themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the wife of any crime fighter to be; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) may be the most confusing person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: reckless but cool. Other characters include the spoken Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the over-musical 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also star. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. I haven't even explained the plot! The reason involves Tracy trying - and missing so far - finding a way to nab Big Boy. At the same time, there have been some very bizarre events in the city, the answers that may or may not be closer than all believe. <br /> <br /> Of course, the most important thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty had trouble performing at his age, he took it well. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
