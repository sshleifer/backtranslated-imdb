Let me start by saying at a young age of 34 that I was suddenly a widow. I was destroyed when he wasn't sick --- he died unexpectedly because of a coronary --- his carotid blew out - he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from the police because he fell on something and the base was in. I was a suspect of murder until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My kids were as traumatized as I was, so in love with a good father figure like him. I had three small children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my in-laws attacked me orally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, demanding that I not take care of the children and hit masks and show people what they wanted to see, not show them my pain in Holidays ... No one stood up for me and my choice to sit for a holiday, except of course the grief therapist I saw had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My sister-in-law didn't get it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them and I have never been back to a holiday. This is just an example of how my grief was disrespected! My own (new) man has seen me fall apart and talk about the traumas when I shared my soul. I collapse, can't breathe, hyperventilate, and are generally interrupted for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today my soul was touched, my heart was broken. My fears and pain re-surfaced from the real demons this movie presents; how to care for how others expect us and the demons inside. Adam Sandler perfectly portrayed the terrible pain you face, overcomes and most of all works through your own time! This movie deepened all the pain I have been trying to handle over the years. You see, when something damages your soul so deeply, so deep that expression is all that comes from the mouth in moments of thinking, you can't do it without wishing you were dead and going through life in a dead state. The Bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26, which I have put on, that when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, the Holy Spirit of God carries this pain to the feet of God - - I need not speak. Sandler portrayed it to perfection! <br /> <br /> There is a scene where he has been taken to a hearing, for mental health purposes, and he goes back to meet his in-laws --- (I'm familiar with) --- and he tells them The amazing truths he has been given by Per Se that he can't get over. It is a deeply powerful and powerful achievement. I started bawling and found it difficult for the wards to come out of the theater and feel my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw the first hand, my precise movements, while trying to hold it together. a lesson for him, my youngest, who almost remembers his father. It has been 13 years for me, but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my sister-in-law forever as they demanded a mask on my feelings and my surrender to their desires, rather than respect for myself. <br /> <br /> I'm writing this so if you're a griever, you're prepared for this movie, but highly recommend it in the 1000-star quality Sandler gave. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a griever, take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief so that they will have peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul cannot express the words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go watch this movie with tissue and not without preparing to take it in ... to your soul!
