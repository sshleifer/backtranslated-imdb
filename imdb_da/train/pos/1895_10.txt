I saw this over Christmas, I don't know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I saw it, so there we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie I see all the way with a big silly smile on my face, and it's a mix of special performances, great jolly music and a screaming white and charm script that causes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that could well be hated (pampered, rich, lazy, feeling sad), but turning to someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla a queen waitress who manages to pull the hard / soft on the inside, lady Arthur gives almost her world to. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur again and again, and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift, it's a nice movie.
