Personally, I think Sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made. It affected all feelings from anger to romance to complete the tragedy. And Brando should have won for best actor. Anyway, the movie is great, the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it and fall in love with you.
