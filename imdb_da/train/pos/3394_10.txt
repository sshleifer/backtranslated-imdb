I saw this movie by accident when I bought it as the B-side of The Omega Man DVD. The Omega man was a little disappointed - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later, the rest of the thing is just the thing of the TV movie. But Soylent Green is in a completely different league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I have never seen anything like before. Heston randomly comes to bed with "furniture" while discussing something else completely independent! A whole lot of people are being sprayed by a fleet of mechanical excavators! A pastor acquainted and shot by the confessor. Ok maybe it has been done since - but there aren't many movies that are as consistently original as this. And what goes between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily I saw this movie without knowing the end - which seems to be rare. Then I saw it again and enjoyed all the little tracks that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and some good sets too. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
