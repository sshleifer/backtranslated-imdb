Let's get some things right first: Zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can get them WALK, RUN, hell, even fly if he wants to. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so amazingly original. I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero, or when fan-boys expect everything like Romero. Some idiots believe that zombies should only grow like a typical Romero movie, once again no zombies exist, so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants to. The zombies in this movie all look very good, but they are not dead bodies since they just lost dead! They are pretty messy and full of chopped faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat. It looked so incredibly right, my daughter was crying when she saw it. This movie got really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so it made me see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to true horror fan taste. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
