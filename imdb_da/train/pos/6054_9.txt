I saw an example of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT that I had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle mags. Even though I was mostly towards the breeds, the trick was to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) proved enough to get me off the beer and party. Finally! we've done it! US Brits have actually made a great motorcycle movie (and no it's not like torque) this is up there with the best British comedy. Mark my words, this is Phil Daniel's best screenplay, and for Geoff Bell there is a new British legend that makes his name felt. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadow's fantastic Dead Mans Shoes, and here he gives a quiet touch that he can proudly add to his growing movie reputation. This is a movie, not just for us Bikers, but I think for everyone (even my boyfriend loved it). I hope it gets the same brilliant answer on the mainland as it was in the Isle of Man. I don't want to go into the details of some classic scenes that this movie has (watch out for the store) as it would spoil the fun, but I'd say go see, enjoy and have one of the best nights in the movie theater you have had been in for a while. I really think it could be a cult classic. As they said at TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
