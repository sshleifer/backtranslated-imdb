Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and clever ideas I've ever seen when talking about movies. They had only one landscape, a bunch of actors and a plot. So what made it so special was all the effective direction, great dialogues and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal with as rats in a maze. His second movie, "Cypher" (2002), was about his story, but it was not as good as "Cube", but here the characters are tested as rats again. "Nothing" is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo back to his 'Cube days', unlocking the characters again in a completely different room without even having to play with the characters as playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a thriller sci-fi (although some of the advertising teasers and trailers mistakenly seemed so), "Nothing" is a loose and light comedy that can probably be called a modern satire about our society and also the intolerant world we Living Once again, Vicenzo amazes us with a good idea for such a small kind of thing. 2 actors and a dazzling white scenario, it's all you have the most time and you don't need more than that. While the "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" confusing, "Nothing" is quite the opposite, but at the same time desperate. This movie once again proves that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the movie sometimes fails, but the primary idea means a lot and matches any errors. There's no more to say about this movie because everything is a great surprise and a completely different experience I had in the movie since the "Cube".
