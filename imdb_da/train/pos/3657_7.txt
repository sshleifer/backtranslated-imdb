This film is like a 1950s version of Ettore Scolas Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Less gender and less realism, but a story of great humanism and warmth. I wouldn't call this a neo-realistic picture. It is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and must be classified as a comedy, even though it deals with serious cases (like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). Typically Italian, however, very emotional and hard to resist except for a coarse person. Sentimentalism is a letdown, although this image was not meant to be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's a lovable and hilarious comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
