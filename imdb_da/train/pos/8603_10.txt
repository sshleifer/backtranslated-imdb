The movie is a fantasy. The story is thin but serves as the structure on which some amazing songs are sung and sung beautifully. (I still can't believe that such beautiful and attractive people could sing well). Some of the dialogues are wonderfully wise. The costumes made me feel like I was looking at a fashion show from 1942. <br /> <br /> Films are designed to serve different purposes. This one is designed to entertain and it certainly does. If I have a negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the beautiful dashing count. Some of the close-ups made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing splendidly. But Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is good before my time, and I'm a new one to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy's movie and associated conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love the classic rock music that fills most modern movies, there is no doubt that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more beautiful and better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in cinemas today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I am unclear why so many other posters are excusing to like this movie and more generally this group of movies. They say it is dated and trying to explain why that is the way it is. And those who do not like it say that it is not very good, but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly still be entertaining people when so many other movies are long forgotten. There is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and good music.
