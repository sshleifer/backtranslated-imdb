The first thing I thought when I watched these movies was: It's not really a movie, it's certainly not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "movie". It is completely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So, if you are not used to expressing things in a symbolic way, you will find it strange if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, and spiritual life, you will believe it is just an adventure ... and even a strange , chaotic. For me, "The legend of Zu" is completely transparent. And I like it. It tells us in pictures the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the battle that is as old as humanity, and anyone who is in search of the sense of this life is confronted with it. The film is of course made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the world and human vision are different. But as far as we are all human and have the same human nature, we necessarily have shared experiences and can understand each other. It's a really beautiful movie! And I, as we had several movies like this - movie with meaning. There are too many empty stories that are only good to make time pass faster.
