I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! This film is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given to the little girl Marie as a gift. Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and they become best friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. That's when the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to find her way back to Marie. This movie is so cute, funny, touching, sad and more. When I first looked at this movie, it made me cry. The birds courage and urge to find her Marie for all that time was so touching. I have to say that the end is so cute and sad, but you have to see it to find out how it goes. At the end, the guard is trying to help him after hearing his story. Will he find his long lost Marie or not? Find out when you see this sweet, hearty warming movie. It will touch your heart.
