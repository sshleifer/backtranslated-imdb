This movie is great entertainment to watch with wife or girlfriend. There are laughing laughs and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth seeing in their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of different nudists and personality types. The Australian coastal landscape is simply amazing to see. What a place to visit, at least, and one day it can be my hiding place. I really enjoy this movie and every time I see it, I enjoy it more. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this film is of course a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.
