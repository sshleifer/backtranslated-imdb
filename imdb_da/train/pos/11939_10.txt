I always like this great baseball movie! It has a great atmosphere, including two amazing actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has amazing special effects and comes from all the movie's actors! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits well with the movie! Some of the actors reminded me of the actual baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell character reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Singer's commentator, in my opinion, looked like how Al Hrabosky looks today. This is a great movie for non-baseball fans and I highly recommend this movie!
