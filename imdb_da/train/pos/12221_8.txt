This is a good job. Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest all the way through. Its biggest drawback is that it seems that it was done for TV: Full screen, and although there were more sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but boy got it close!). Strange as Netflix shows it was rated R. <br /> Nevertheless, very titillating, and I want Alicia Silverstone to make more movies like this. <br /> <br /> A Netflix reviewer said it was part of a series, but I haven't been able to figure out which series is. I want to know because this movie was so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 08/23/2005
