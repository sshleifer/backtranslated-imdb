Along with Darkwing Duck, this has been unduly canceled. Disney has been in decline since Tarzan, and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?) The theme theme is also imprisoned. Out of all the bad guys who are all big on their own, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and baloo sounds very similar to voice overs in the jungle book, which is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it's pretty inspiring! The animation was spot on, and the manuscript had lots of jokes that have been heavily deficient in animations for years. PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW BACK! 10.9.
