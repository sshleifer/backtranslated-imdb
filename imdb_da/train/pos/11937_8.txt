It was certainly the case with angels in Outfield. It was on TV last night, and I think I had not seen the movie since my last year in high school, and I am now in my 4th year of college. Although the movie has many flaws, it's just so touching that you can't help but sit down, watch it and enjoy yourself. It's also fun. Danny Glover ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh aloud at him most of the time. It adds to the movie and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel the characters in the movie, though the development is not the best. One should see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
