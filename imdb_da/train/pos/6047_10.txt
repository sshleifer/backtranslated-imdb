The amazing thing about Withnail & I is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all of its other finery. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16. I know some of the wide sheets that broke the knife into this movie when it came out in cinemas, but I saw it on a packed house in Hailsham, and everyone really seemed to enjoy it. I grew up in the Deans forest, and it just took me back to my mushrooms and dope days (had some great friends - hate to think about what they have so far - probably running the municipal council). I've seen it a couple of times on DVD, and I already see the movie as an old buddy who will stay forever as part of my collection (how do I like this movie and the Dambustersne - don't really think) the edge towards the other half of this movie, and I think the social interactive scenes with the locals are done brilliantly. I like the mix of the three main characters and there is really a nice writing here with some very quotes and dare I say a good smash of integrity. I've tried to get the soundtrack, but it's not been released (shame as it is a corker). Someone told me that it was originally a stage game, not sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearian touches / references that appear to grow up throughout the movie (also seen Dylan Thomas ref) and like all little gemstones, there will always be little things to discover as the final scene that gives a nod to Easyrids as they start that they are next trip. All in all, a true unpretentious piece of filmmaking (love it!)
