Night of the Living Homeless is a fun fake of the 1978 movie (and the 2004 remake) of "Dawn Of The Dead". Just this time ... with the homeless. The episode has homeless everyone coming to South Park and the people can't figure out why. They treat the homeless as zombies who want change and a couple of parents end up in a supermarket like in the movie. So now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them. This is a pretty fun episode with some great moments as the boys sing their own version of 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love". Extremely good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
