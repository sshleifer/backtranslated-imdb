Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan once again attacks his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. He refuses to take a vacation, he gets a simple case that takes him outside San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside the city, which leads him to the trail of a vengeance. As an entry into the Dirty Harry franchise movie starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary "Go ahead, low my day" line that Eastwood lives wonderfully through broken teeth before one hand gives a robbery. Very bad and that's just what fans can expect from him. However, the film shifts fast gear and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this murderer is not so mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the protagonist who ruled all his previous film appearances with the excuse of the magic word Magnum Force. On the bright side, this new story draws several parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that wasn't there before, but fans looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. But a thrilling climax ends the film on an exciting note, so if you don't mind something a little different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for violence and rape scene
