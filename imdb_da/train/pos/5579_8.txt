I had never heard of this movie before I accidentally came across it when I looked at IMDB. I saw that it had received many horrible reviews that contained very colorful explanations of how much it stunk. Of course, that meant that I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised when the whip is actually a good movie. I saw it with a group of friends, and we laughed more than we had on many recent highly acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedies. This is an independent film and as such depicts its subject (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fake. Obviously, I suspect that people's perception of this movie will depend a lot on their experience of life. If you've never dated or partied much, you won't get this movie because you haven't met people like these characters. If you have, you will recognize many of the situations depicted here in a comical way. The ending was also good as it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virgin romanticists as opposed to many Hollywood films.
