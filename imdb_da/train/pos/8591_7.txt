This was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good for just sitting and watching and being entertained. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or something and certainly does not deserve one, but I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like the show 24, but set in film format. If you like it all, we have to stop the terrorist from killing the president's kind of movie, so you'll enjoy this flick. Personally, I think the story has been done too much, but The Sentinel adds a little twist to the mill in the Secret Service. All in all, this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life, but who says every movie should be good?
