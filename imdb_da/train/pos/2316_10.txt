I saw this movie by chance, being curious by the trailer on television. I like when I discover movies like this, small and expensive stories about ordinary people. Although the end is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has some fun moments, especially in Dania's first characterization with her innocent and pure love affair with the Court. It's really a beautiful, floating love story with 3 high points: Reese Witherspoon, who kept his promise in the cinema world, the beautiful filmography of "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the amazing score of James Newton Howard, who is truly the soul of the movie. His themes (which deserved an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have transformed the manuscript into music.
