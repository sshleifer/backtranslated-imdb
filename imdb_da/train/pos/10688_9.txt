I didn't really know what to expect when I went out to watch the movie, except for the slightly surrealistic plot that a lonely man orders a Russian breach over the internet. That and it had Nicole Kidman in it. I absolutely loved the movie and came out and thought 'wow'. <br /> <br /> Refreshing down the earth, the film moves well with a few surprises in every corner. The conditions in the film are credible, with Nicole and Chaplin working beautifully against each other. The mood is subtle, with some big 'Office' -like scenes at the bank, and the thriller element brings excitement without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is about real people in an unusual situation. It's less about heroines and more about delicate relationships. Brit movie making at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
