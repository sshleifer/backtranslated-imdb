The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and Depression after almost destroyed the American musical theater, in fact it was the final death blow to Vaudeville. The ones behind the curtains were hit as badly as the front ones. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate the show economy and its own personal economy, work theater director James Cagney comes out with a brilliant idea. Stage delivers relevant prologues to the films shown at the various cinemas that pop up overnight from the old theaters. Some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on. Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. It gives James Cagney a chance to show some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. Cagney said in his retirement that while he was screening his few and far between musicals, he could hardly be bothered by some of his equally dramatic films. He wanted him to have made a few musicals in his career, and I wish he had. <br /> <br /> Of course, the construction of these Busby Berkeley is extravaganzas on stage in a movie palace despite all logic and reason. But it is so creative and fun to see. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell will sing three songs in the Footlight Parade, Ah Moon is here, the Honeymoon Hotel, and at a waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler further cementing that screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she collaborates with James Cagney in my favorite song from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagney's no nonsense girl Friday at the theater. Like in Blonde Crazy, she's the one with the right brains in that duo, and it's her fast thinking that bails him out of some domestic issues he has on top of his theatrical. One of Blondell's best screen roles. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the choir as in the IMDb pages for both of them. John Garfield is seen briefly in the Shanghai Lil number. And in a scene at the start of the movie, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater showing a B-Western star band John Wayne. The duke's voice is unmistakable. But it is even more unusual that the short clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh, who plays another Cagney assistant in the Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers played a little joke there. I have to believe that the clip was conscious. Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at its surreal best.
