Although this was a disaster in the box office, it's my favorite movie. It gives a strong message about family. It has a lot of violence and has a song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh portrays it in this movie. Don't read reviews of critics, they are just ignorant. This movie has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So if you want to see action more realistically than Main Hoon Na (still good movie), it's the movie.
