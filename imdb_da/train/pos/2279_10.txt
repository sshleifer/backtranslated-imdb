Before this, the weak "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this screen adaptation of "Mother Night" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery and tragedy intent. Fortunately, it wasn't Hollywood-Ized or idiotized to leave the movie "Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (which I think you do for the slaughterhouse five). It's probably true for the Breakfast of Champions too, but they did such a bad job of it, you better just read the book and not watch the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this movie.
