Well, I just discovered there is a show more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The Gentlemen League" is a sick British comedy that deals with the most horrible, insane and obnoxious little town across the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "Vicer of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem quite normal !! The format of the show is much like LITTLE Britain, except that it is all centered around the towns of this one sanctuary. Both shows have the same sketches over and over every episode and some obviously inspired "Little Britain" (especially job-demanding class shit). But the show is different because the play has a poor and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows, although it is raw like "Little Britain" (therefore not a show for children). In particular, animal cruelty and serialization are recurring themes during the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you haven't guessed, this is NOT a show for kids, the easily disturbed or normal people, and that's why I liked it. But you really need very thick skin and a love for the awful to enjoy this to the maximum. Fun and incredibly monstrous - you have to see it to believe it.
