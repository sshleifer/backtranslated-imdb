I felt obliged to see the 1983 Jane Timothy Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of Jane Eyre because I had just written an article on the BBC's Jane Eyre for TheScreamOnline 2006. So I approached to look this way as I would turn to doing homework. <br /> <br /> I was first annoyed. The lighting in this version is poor. All / everything is washed out in a bright white-colored light that in some scenes cast shadows on the wall behind the signs. <br /> <br /> The sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. <br /> <br /> And the pancake makeup is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets don't quite transfer the Gothic mood of the novel. They are too fussy, also Martha Stewart. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester compelling Martha Stewart domestic events. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in cave-like gloomy, very fitting for the novel's Gothic mood. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all these objections ... not only is this the best "Jane Eyre" I have seen it can be the best fit of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Despite its technical flaws, this "Jane Eyre" brought the feeling back to me to read "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say it's too close to the book. For me, a person who appreciated the book and did not need to be anything less "proper" or something less "Christian" or more sexy. The truthfulness of this version to the novel Bronte, actually written, is its best asset. <Br /> <br /> Bronte wrote a darn good book. There is a reason why it has lasted 150 years plus, while others slicker, sexier and lighter texts have disappeared. <br /> <br /> As a long time "Jane Eyre" fan I was condemned to Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is famous, not beautiful; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if it's not amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton provides a fascinating performance like Rochester. He blew me straight away. I have never seen anything like his full devotion to the role, text, dialogue and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings Rochester's side to gloomy life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is supposed to be a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles also got scary stripes down, for example when he shouts "Enough!" after Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once here. You really can't tell if he will hurt Jane or himself in his desperation. <br /> <br /> Rochester is imperiousness, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability: Dalton conveys everyone, sometimes seconds apart. It is fantastic. And here is the key - the actor who performs Rochester must convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in complete despair, lonely living with a nasty, life-disturbing secret. <br /> <br /> No other actor I've ever tried, this part conveys the black hole of despair that Timothy Dalton does. Current fan of favorite Toby Stephens doesn't even try. Dalton hits it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a single bar, I would say, "That guy is trouble. Don't even look at him." He is the radioactive with tamped down agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only the best, the best Jane I've seen, she is one of the few Janes that producers were willing to throw as the book throws Jane. No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, describe Bronte * not * a static, robust Jane with finely curved eyebrows and pouty lips. Instead, Charlotte Bronte Jane is smooth, poor, blurred, unclear and a little, and not beautiful. Zelah has a small mouth, close eyes and a little nose. She is really "small". She is no fashion model. And she's the best Jane, the best for the book. <br /> <br /> Some told her a cold or boring. No, she's true to the book. Bronte Jane is not a red hot mama, she is a protected, deprived teen whose inner passions come out only on key moments that Zelah does here. The book's Jane is one that you have to look slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly if you really want to plunge her depths. You need to see Zelah here to know who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more fire in Zelah on a key scene, but it's a scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version is like any other version I've seen away from expressing the overtly Christian themes in Jane Eyre. "Christianity is not coincidental subtitle in" Jane Eyre " Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity and gives her a subversive, versus cultural way of reading and living, her seemingly condemned, pinched life, Christianity, and a Christian God convincing poor, ordinary, hiding Jane Her worth, her need to live up to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal, is not quite clear here. <br /> <br /> At least Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel And this adaptation of it, of all those I've seen, mines and honors short story best of any custom I've seen, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions that aren't fully named the book a task to look at in many places fond of what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse or hypocrisy of a culture based on appearance and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote - about Jane's experiences at Lowood and her relationship with St. John - is part of what makes Jane's relationship with Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.
