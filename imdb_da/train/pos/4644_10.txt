Flat out the funniest spear of pretentious art house films ever made. <br /> <br /> This flick exposes all the clich√©s and then some! Scary Bad (Downs Syndrome!) Actors. Terribly heavy self-worthy dialogue. Scenes to shock, but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague mental drive. It achieves exactly what it was designed for. A hilarious satire of the boring movies made of pampered teenage trust funders, to show their parents when they ask them what they have done over the last two years! After "What is it?" received the Cannes award, the presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was actually a spear, in some of his own films! He probably blew up the info. So far, he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, see it and laugh, it will be a classic of humor for years to come.
