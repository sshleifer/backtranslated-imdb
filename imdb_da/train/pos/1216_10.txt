As a child, I preferred the first Care Bear movie as it was so dark. I always sat and saw the first one. As I got older, I learned to prefer it. What I think is that this movie is too dark for infants, but as you grow older you learn to treasure it since you understand it, it doesn't seem as dark as it was when you were a kid. <Br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is better than the first, everything is so much deeper. It may contradict the first movie, but you have to ignore the first movie to watch it. The kids are just too adorable, I rewind on the 'Flying My Colors' scene. I tend to annoy everyone by singing it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is amazing! A big hand to Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I have downloaded them all and am all I listen to, I listen to 'Our Beginning' also known as 'Recalling' for the moment. I have always preferred this soundtrack to the first, even though I just love Carol King's song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. I think the animation is great, the animation in both movies is amazing. I was surprised when I sat down and saw it about 10 years later and saw that the animation on time was excellent. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not much backup from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I don't think it's weird / strange. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is about how Care Bears came to defeat Demon, Dark Heart. The end is surprising and again, every 'Pokemon Movie' beats Care Bears Moral issues. It has an effect on you. Again, this film can teach all people of all ages about morality.
