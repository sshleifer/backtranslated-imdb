Take 4 couples whose relationship was already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise, where they will be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple but outrageous and fun. Let Fox throw the morale out of the window and let debauchery flow. It was like a true version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about people who conniving and manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about brightness and temptation, pure and simple and the ultimate test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People either loved the show or hated it. It was like slowing down to look at a horrible traffic accident. You know you shouldn't see, but you can't help but see. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
