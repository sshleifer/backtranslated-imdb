For anyone who liked the series, this movie will be something to see. But it also lets you have more. I loved the way that each character (detective) made an appearance. At least with the end of who is the fourth chair because they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is Bayless of course. The same as the series was a very well-composed series of scenes. This is a series I would have lived on. Thanks to the cast for some amazing TVs.
