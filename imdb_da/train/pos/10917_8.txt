I just managed to grab the Celestial region 3 DVD by The Five Venoms and what a super job they have made of it. A great digital remastered transfer and a must have for any Kung Fu fan. The story is straight ahead and has already been mentioned, so I will not go into it again. Needless to say, it is the battle scenes that many people buy the movie and they do not disappoint. Only problem is that they are slightly few and far between and seem over repeated. Bruce Lee could take this mass on and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and beats come with all important "type writer" clicks and air "whooshes", which is a cool effect, even though it's fun! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a B +. Good but not great. That way I feel it could have been so much better. Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had just as good a story and better action.
