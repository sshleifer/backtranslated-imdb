This is a movie that should be seen by anyone interested in, performed by, or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an incredibly accurate and sensitive depiction of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and its symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in the cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in 'Where the Truth Lies'. I would recommend that this movie appear in all schools, as you will never see better on this subject. Alison Lohman is excellent and one wonders in her ability to convey anxiety to a girl suffering from this obsessive-compulsive disorder. If barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional reach is so accurate that each scene can be measured microscopically for its degree of trauma, on a scale of increasing hysteria and desperation that reaches intolerable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice for playing her mother, and does so with great sympathy and a variety of emotions as finely tuned as Lohmans. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators that vibrate in resonance with each other. This movie is really an amazing achievement and director Cat Shea has to be proud of it. The only reason not to see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature movies, it is after all animal behavior at the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how an afflicted soul can destroy its own body in a crazy despair. And if we do not sympathize with people suffering from the depth of despair, then we are dead inside.
