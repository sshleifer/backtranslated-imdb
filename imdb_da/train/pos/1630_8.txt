I may well be one of the few who really stuck in this movie. I also watched this movie when it came out and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was far ahead of its time. Humor in the film itself is purely MAD magazine. I can't see why MAD is behind this feature. It was also one of the few films in the early 80s to have a killing accompanying soundtrack with punk and new wave bands coming from L.A. at the time. I own the soundtrack and I play it all the time until today. What can I say? There is absolutely the worst movie out there. I don't think Porky is as fun as the Up Academy, there are some really good laughs in the whole movie, and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or being laid. Hey, no one said this should be the Maltese Falcon.
