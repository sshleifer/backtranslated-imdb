I couldn't stop commenting after reading the very short "Not Bad" comment. This movie is much better than just not bad. The play is stellar, even from the kids in the cast who do not play sweet or anything, but work just like my son's friends. The film is smart and expects the audience to be just as good. The double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than acting as a time-filling. I watched this movie with my children, and then I saw it again for myself a few days later. If you have children and are ill in the death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, check out "Holes". My 6 year old enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the two. How many movies can you say about it?
