This group of English pros is a pleasure to see. The support molding can form a series of their own. It is seen before the love tiangle between the operation's head, his wife and a new beautiful boy's surgery resident. Only the superior functionalities of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and the sexy Robson Greene lift this from the trash can to a very enjoyable "trumpet". The only drawback is that it is difficult to accept that smoldering Francesca Annis should fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who likes me, is hardly an international or even a British sex symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green would turn her fire on, with apologies for the "Doors". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is Oven's father David Bradley. See him in "The Way We Live Now," in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​his reach. Daniela Nardini, as the kitchen secretary, once sex toys, is hard to forget when she asked mistress who makes Kitchen apologize that he has ever looked at his big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick operatives, as I have said, could have their own series. They are so good. The whole thing is very fun, and I recommend it warmly and thank imdbman for letting the paying customers have their opinion in this fascinating place.
