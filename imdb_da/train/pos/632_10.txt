OK here is how I do this. I classify movies on 10 components. In principle, each component will start with 5 points. It may lose or get 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance between all five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long through the movie and I was still impressed by the amazing drama and tearing excitement. Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all good adventures had already been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, returning to my childhood, and at that time I again believed in unicorns, evil witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Biography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well at most angles, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what was happening just outside the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love using C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were credible. The magic forces were frighteningly realistic. All in all, less is it and it had it all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and spicy actors, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully evil, Charlie Cox made Tristan alive, Claire Danes gave feelings to the stars, and I will never see and Robert De Niro the same again. <br/> <br /> Acts - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER see and Robert De Niro the same again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. It felt a little hasty and I think if the movie was a little longer, they could have made the characters a little better justice. Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun ?? even the mouse had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly only remember a little piece of music from the whole movie. I do not complain that the music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect end! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others might have been more subdued, but no threads were left. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HELL YES! See it in the theater? Definitely! Bottom line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I highly recommend seeing it in the theater, I know I will go back in seconds!
