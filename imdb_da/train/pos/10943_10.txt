I have to vote for this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review, pity me, whisper to Hollywood and involve me in his freaky / funny world. But to a great extent it was good. Of course, the first episode is to find its feet, but it has made Silverman's announcement run all the way through. It is not a laughing high kind of comedy, but it is good, too much has a laughter track for it and it would not be right with signs when you have to laugh, it is the audience to hear that their inner jester is laughing at the absurdity of all. I can easily see this as the bizarre Drew Carey show with its odd characters and incredibly strong central character. It's worth seeing, look forward to the following episodes. A very good chance from the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
