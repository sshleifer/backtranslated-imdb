I loved this movie, seen tonight on a big screen in the cinema! The audience laughed aloud at some very interesting things, and the fast pace was most enjoyable. <br /> <br /> As a singer and musical instructor, I ask about part of Roby Keeler's vocal in "By a Waterfall." The key modulated and she suddenly sang much lower, in a very soft voice that didn't any resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vowels. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer? It sounds to me. I'd like to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you so much.
