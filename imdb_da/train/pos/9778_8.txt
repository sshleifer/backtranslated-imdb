This is a trio of stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali", about an experimental municipality (or something like that) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, who took people traveling into themselves and into rich unknown, and left some damage here and there, I would say. Many years later, part of the damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show up. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact he was torn apart and the suspect was a man who might not have existed. Seems that this woman is able to project some inner demons, or find the sister of the man who was killed when trying to talk to this woman as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". He is a skin male, a speeding freak and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this municipality, resulting in the good doctor who helps the young man realize his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer trying to "cure" this woman who was part of that municipality, and let go of a demon who has lived in this woman, but you wonder if he did it, or if she solved it because it couldn't survive in her anymore. All three of these stories are pretty scary and exciting, because you're never quite sure what to expect, and the preconditions and settings are as diverse as conventional horror movies as it adds to the unusual. This has a kind of low budget look and feel, but it also manages to evoke a rather eerie atmosphere throughout. I saw this with my mouth hanging open quite a bit of time, and when the real horror (and gore) came it hit pretty hard. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing movie and liked it very much. A good little find, the one I would give it 8 out of 10.
