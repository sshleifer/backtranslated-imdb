DOCTEUR PETIOT, who employs Michel Serrault, is a brutal story of a brutal man. A doctor who cures the sick in the occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet he sounds like the weakest among the population. Fine art and filmography are excellent and give an extra macabre feel to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie is sure not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Serrault, for his chilling portrayal.
