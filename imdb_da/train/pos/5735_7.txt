This is a short, spooky animated series by David Lynch (as it says in the beginning), and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods, parent-worn great man, with a wife having a stress disorder and an annoying son. Both of these elements are harp on repeatedly in the short episodes, and there is no real plot to be seen. It's easier if you think of this as an extraordinarily strange, slightly macabre Looney Tunes with much more fun, profanity, bloody violence, and occasional hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD with Eraserhead with previously seen Eraserhead. Don't look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - that's all but. In fact, it almost seems to be a statement against such things, as its rough style spits in the face of any kind of animation convention you might see. As Lynch says, "If this is fun, it's just fun because we see the absurdity of it all."
