All I can say is, first film this season that got my attention. I chose it because of the actors Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising. I just saw it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, true .. but it makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things happen right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better, and who gets rid of their engagement in the cause. In fact, I can't seem to feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie .. and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard did a great role and deserve a 10 from me.
