this one is out there. Not much to say about it, except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in film of beastiality. I can see why this movie was banned as long as the issues dealt with in the movie are still a bit taboo for most of the world, saying that the eroticism of the movie is well-deserved and fits into the mood of the movie. It's a good movie that works well and serves a purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross borders, which we don't often see in movies. I came across this movie on the web, which I thought I could check out. I enjoyed the movie as it is thoughtful and somewhat erotic at the same time. Something you rarely see in movies today.
