Some of the posters seem less than grunt-headed because it is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but it makes it clear that it is not. You will look a long time to find a bigger Rodgers and Hart fan than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly chopped alive and they knew Der Bingle inside and tailored some good songs - But Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's always you , the day after forever etc - to fit his very personal style, and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad, Once And For Always, plus a few summed up philosophy-little entries in If You stumble on your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing. The spanked plot is not meant to be taken seriously - why else do Merlin heavy when most others, if not all other versions are more friend / mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering why Sir Lancelot, who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chastity and the maintenance of metamorphoses into a schoolyard rowdy you are not going to get much fun out of what is really a fun movie. On balance it does what it stands to do, entertain, so good luck in it.
