A classic cartoon, always fun and fun. It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters. Road Rovers is a show worth seeing, it's a short 13 episodes, and if you can ever get a chance to see it, you need to. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they do, you should buy it too. If you have kids who like dogs, they will love road rovers! Road Rovers should have been given more attention while it was being sent, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.
