This movie is one of the sleepers all the time. I gave it a 10 rating. The story is of the famous 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri who fought on the side of the south during the war between states. The clothes they wore were authentic, the story and why the fighters are very accurate and well-researched. There was actually one of those battles that didn't take place as they portrayed ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really knows how to make the most of them. I suppose it was a combination of great instructions, super casting to find the right people and excellent performance of the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really jelled! It has action, romance, excitement, good guys and evil guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and the story rolled into a movie. Even the future has Spiderman and Jewel. And she's good!
