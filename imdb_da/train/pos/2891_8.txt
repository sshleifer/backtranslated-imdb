We saw this on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things should be tighter there by the "mouse" than normal. <br /> <br /> As this movie only runs for 74 minutes and they had to put it out for 2 hours of TV broadcast, they had, and I do not, commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes. And during these advertising breaks, they had another advertisement in the deck of a "TV show" that hosted the oh-so annoying Kelly Rippa, who was listening to the magic wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True". <br /> </ br> again and again, break after break, disney took time out of the right movie to tell us the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thanks, Disney, for serving us to create a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie. Still, all this commercialism and cash register ringing made it a difficult task to get into the real movie of "Cinderella" because then, when the commercials were over, I had forgotten where the story had gone. <br /> <br /> But of course, the original "Cinderella" maintains its magic, and that story is still good, though we've all seen countless times. It's a pity that they had to cheaper it with all the marketing for what seems to be a lame follow-up.
