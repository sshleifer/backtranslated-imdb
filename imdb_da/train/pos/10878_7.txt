Personally I enjoyed cutting thouroughly. It was the first time I saw a theatrical release of Australian slasher flick. A genre is usually restricted to the mainstream Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> With all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of Australia, I loved being able to watch a homemade horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything. I didn't even think it was really a spear of other movies. It was a supernatural theme terrified as a nightmare on Elm Street, not screaming or I know what you were doing last summer, and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief. I think it's time for Australian movies to get into the mainstream genre. <br /> <br /> The clip was original, scary enough and ultimately just a little fun. I would give it seven out of ten and would not treat it as something serious. It did what I expected to do, entertain and scare me enough to be satisfactory. I enjoyed it.
