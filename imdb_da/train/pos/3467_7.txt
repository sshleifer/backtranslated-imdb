I still wonder why I saw this movie. Admittedly, before I saw this movie, I knew almost nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had lots of fans, they had some albums that some claim to be greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still for some reason I decided to see it, don't expect much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it a lot! The dialogue was written and handled very well in the case of a small accent mess up. This is very important because John and Paul are talking about the whole movie, even though they are taken outside to explore more options and to keep in mind. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn deliver good overall results. <br /> <br /> The finish was also very smart. I have enjoyed how the movie gets excited about SNL performace, and then you head over and make you realize it would be better if they just let it go and finish it with a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching roof terrace. Overall, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It's a very good way to settle your curiosity on what might have happened if 6 years after the break Paul just came up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason for watching this movie, and definitely my curiosity for who the beatles really were and what could have been the case with them after the crash.
