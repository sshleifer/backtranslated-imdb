Erroll works for the Department of Public Security and his job is to check up for sexual offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line at his job and turns on the sex offenders. I don't blame him, but his boss is ready to retire, and Allison comes. Erroll is now training her to do her job and it is like a job shadow. Allison is a little naive about the job at first, but she doesn't know how much danger she really is, and that's all Erroll's fault. He begins to go a long way with his obsession with finding a missing girl when his job is not to be a police officer. It's a pretty decent movie about a crazy guy pushing the boundaries and working outside his "scope". Erroll did a good job, but for Allison's safety. It also has some good mystery to it, and just as I figured out, there was more to it.
