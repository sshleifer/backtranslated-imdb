War Inc. is a funny but strange movie. The actors like, the movie also likes, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I'll go into the plot later. This is a movie with some weird casting choices. Besides John Cusack as a hitman, as we saw years ago in Grosse Point blank as I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff, who plays a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something similar. Her character is strange. There is a scene where she holds a scorpion in her pants. And hits on Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist at the end that involves the two characters. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> It's the only casting choice I'm going to make. Because it's just odd. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes incredibly fun and I never got bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Except Miss Duff. She's not big. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hitman named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent down to some Middle Eastern cities to put a blow on an oilman named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help with a pop star's wedding (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). However, there is something about pop star. Hauser is disgusted by her. There is a scene where she sings a song to him and afterwards he throws up. <br /> <br /> The button at the end of the movie kind of reveals why. The thing about the twist is that I was happy to see it coming. But it doesn't matter. This is a strange, fun and entertaining comedy. I love most of the actors. So really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
