A beautiful new edition of "Zabriskie Point" plays in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full evaluation of the movie. Let's hope that the new print means that a DVD with some insightful "extras" will be out in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the ZP when it came out and thought it was a crash. This time I was completely confused and would classify it as an "almost missed" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule of the late 60's Los Angeles, I lived there then, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place. Kudos to the production designer Dean Tavoularis, who found some incredible places and did excellent work. <br /> <br /> Printing so I run 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden for those under 16 (or 18, I can't remember). I suppose there are fairly restored recordings in this print. SPOILER - I wonder how much of the desert's sex scene was originally cut. What looks today seems quite tame of the current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack music for almost 1 hour in the movie. Before we hear foreign noise such as radio broadcasts etc. Antonioni was very bold to do this. I remember how much was made at the time of missing plays by non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time, Frechette did not tempt me. Halprine is weaker, but gradually improves as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Much of the student recordings look like storage for me. A shot is in a different aspect ratio and is distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are actually staged recordings, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of the Frechette's flying planes. It seems he really made some of the flying - there is no blue screen or double in some shots. I hope to come back to see the movie once. Highly recommended to all Antonioni fans.
