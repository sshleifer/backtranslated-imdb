I do not want to comment on how good the movie was, or what were the mistakes, since I am not a professional film critic, and I do not have enough knowledge about making movies. What I know is that making this kind of movie in your very first shot is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director on that. But in some reviews I've read, critics have complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his siblings were completely removed from history. Now I really want to raise a point here, as the name of the movie suggests, it's not a movie about Hiralal's brothers. It's a movie about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing less nothing less. If we start complaining that some characters are being kept out of action in the movie, it would be a little unfair because these characters didn't fit in the picture, no matter how relevant they were. So I think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfying a critic in ourselves. Enjoy !!!!
