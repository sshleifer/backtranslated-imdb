I love Ashley Judd and think all her movies are good. Ruby <br /> in Paradise is one of her best. It is a very discreet movie that you really have to see close to appreciating it. A story of a woman trying to do it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy. Some of her films like Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill made it better at the box office and video rental. They were also very good movies <br /> <br /> But take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you agree that it is one of Ashley's Best. <br /> <br />
