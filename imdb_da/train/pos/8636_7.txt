Uneven excitement with starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, joining David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a west-facing weather. The latter couple research infamous killings for a forthcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the lamb (unknown to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves together, but Pitt is not credibly scary as a serial killer, even though it is one of his better past roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles at 'Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the short series `Wonderland '. <br /> <br /> Vote: 6
