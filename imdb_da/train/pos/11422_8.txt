Claire Denis Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these figures is often unsatisfactory. For example, a central theme in history is the inability of young france to form strong relationships with others. Although this depiction is performed flawlessly, especially in the way Denis hits the story of scenes from France's return to his childhood home, the girls' lack of intimacy with the other characters of the movie has made it difficult for a viewer to invest great interest in her development (or lack thereof) ) as the main character. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to get engaged in the loosely organized plot. The film exerts a great tension between characters, especially between Aimee and the men of her life, but never fully addresses this social friction and leaves the viewer dissatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you're looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
