Enter into watching this movie I was a little skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> Little did I know that I was traveling through cinematic magic. Everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very close to perfection. Claire Danes shines like the star she is in this movie. From the beginning to the end you become more and more in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening as an evil witch bent on capturing the star of eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is climaxed. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. If you're looking for a fun and fun movie that will be fun for both kids and adults, Stardust is the right way.
