Maybe I identify with this movie because I live in NYC and suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever it is, I must praise the filmmaker for a most amazing work. To do what she did without budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really really good. just as no money was spent on this movie and it still blew me away. Finally, I suggest checking it out if you can. great control, great score and of course a script that will knock you on your ass. see it.
