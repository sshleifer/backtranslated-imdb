This was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the actors' performances were great. I had to think about the movie for a very long time. I think every student should watch this movie so they can think of war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because it told and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I could be as strong as a woman. I really liked it because it told me something about relationships, and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the movie with Der Untergang, The pianist. If you put these three movies together, you have a good view of what happened during the war. We must remember something like the war forever.
