A good movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dancers, with a special mention for "Portobello Ballet" are beautiful. As for the animated section, the battle between animals has become an instant classic; The climax with the attacks of the luminaires is chilling and fascinating. I recommend watching the restored 134 minute version or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy we only have 98 minutes version, even though the film was presented in its original release within 117 minutes. If possible, also see the German video cassette: It was generated from 98 minutes of running, but it lacks every reference to World War II and of all the scenes between English people and their Nazi attackers!
