Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to retire when he has to save his brother Kips (Giovanni Ribisi) life when he turns up a job by completing his brother's job of Steal 50 cars in one night. He has to meet with his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it out and get his bridge out of Dutch. But the police are on him, so can he pull it out? This was one of the major candidates in a movie to recreate, as the original was far from a classic. And if you don't go into it, expect a lot, and turn your mind off so you can ignore the plott hole and just take the movie for what it is. You will end up enjoying the trip. Watch it on a double bill with "The Fast and the Furious" for a night with high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car off for a spin right after. <br /> <br /> My character: B - <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: 7 minutes Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight Reel; The Big Chase; "0 to 60" featurette; "Wild Rides" featurette; Stars on the go; The Cult "Painted On The Heart" music video; Theatrical Trailer and trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
