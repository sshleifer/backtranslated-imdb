Zane and Beringer keep you on the edge of your seats. I don't typically go to military / war movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also humorous. Beringer's character turned out to be heroic and honest. Either way, you know he has your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character evolved throughout the film. He was not just a suit, he certainly proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun. The end through me a little though. It didn't really go with the action in the whole movie, but I'm glad I saw it. Nonetheless. It is worth checking out.
