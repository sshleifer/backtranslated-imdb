This is a wonderful movie. The non-stop teats take several observations to fully appreciate. The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated. I think this movie easily surpasses all his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are amazing together. Some of the humorists would almost push the boundaries of today's movies. Explain how they made it aside and enjoy it for the play it is.
