You can survive surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited down. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-free adult who is willing to pay complete strangers. Valco starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely in the holidays because he doesn't have his own family, so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, who I remember best to play Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, Grandpa. When the whole situation comes down, the truth can be painful. Valco's household is crumbling except for the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you want! Plays and writing are mediocre, but the first moves it through to the final scene.
