Fortunately, by not knowing anything about this movie, I was curious enough to lose it from television. And then the tape ran just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I managed to make the most of it, because this is a really good movie. There are the usual toy submarines and some foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. In view of the 1969 marketing year, the individual small lesbian overtones must have raised a couple of eyebrows. Of course, it is not surprising anyone, and these scenes actually seem beautifully done. And it's not just because of the two Georges actresses. The gas attacks seem to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, and it surely struck me. Very effective. Also the outlook from both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more depth along the usual excitement and action. This is not just a heroic war story about a victory side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well, that's a case of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of the composer Ennio Morricone, this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. And I think I should try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let's hope they get it on DVD soon, so I can get the whole movie in my collection, and more people get to know this little-known gem.
