Just to name one more thing about gentleman Jim. I agree with all the reviews that make this one of Errol Flynn's biggest trips in a career with beautiful excursions. I would think this role plays boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as. Flynn seemed like a celebratory from his memoirs and was a guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. The extra thing I wanted to point out is to see the big montages, transitions and still efforts that emphasize the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent collaborator with Flynn, with film photographer Sid Hickox, the montages were made by an up and coming editor named Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel went so far back, but he's listed right in the credits. He would move on to a good career as a director himself.
