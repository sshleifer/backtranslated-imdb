What I loved about the screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it remained so true to the novel! Great film! As an avid reader, I find the worst thing about film adaptations, that the book is somehow lost in translation. You can tell that the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie star. However, I believe that Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chosen to play Hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that guarantees great praise. I have not seen any of Hornes previous work, but I will certainly look for it after seeing his Stone Angel performance. I heard the Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel will be in spring or summer 2008. I can't wait to see it on the big screen again!
