Cow to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I'm so many movies and comedies, but tell me which one makes you smile every time you see it. But the truth is that humor in this comedy is special. It's Serbian for Serbia. And all the former republics of Yugoslavia know it very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can't enjoy it so much. Because the subtitles destroy the hole. But at least they must try !!!! Yes it is ironic! This is the best flick in Serbian history, and the world doesn't understand it! :-) If you have a chance to see this, you're not blowing OK!
