I totally disagree. I thought this was a great movie for the kids. Dawn wells from gilligans island and promise shown about a barely known dana plato.it was disneylike, and for that you can hardly ignore as pointless fluff.no it was not It was not scary and was not meant to be. I do not want to ruin the end. But it was unusual that it was done. I think the kids characters were great and I didn't know what to expect at the end. Plot also had much more to do with these children than you say these children were expert fishermen, are very central to the plot, especially at the beginning. It also helps them with a jam at the end. It also does not have to be too long. I think it watches in under 95 minutes
