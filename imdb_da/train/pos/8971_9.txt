Generally, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies, and first, RUKA didn't get my attention. But when I knew that this movie was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia in the Soviet era, the more I saw the movie, the more I realized how subversive this innocent little movie was. This subtitle really brought the movie to life and gives it the real maintenance of power as both a work of art and a political statement. The sad little movie is made without dialogue, but it's pretty clear what is happening. A cute little tree man makes a clay pot and has a nice time when a confusingly animated hand suddenly appears and destroys the pot - making it a sculpture of a hand instead. Well, the tree man tries again and again to chase away his hand and do his own thing. But over time, the hand becomes more and more persistent and eventually cries the man. And in the end, the man is dead thanks to the fake hand, and the hand, in a sign of true hypocrisy, gives the man a full funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his dominant government. Not surprisingly, although Czechs loved the movie and gave it critical praise, state (ie, the hand) forbade this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated just over two decades later under the so-called "Velvet Revolution".
