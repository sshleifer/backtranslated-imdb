I've seen this movie only once about 25 years ago and to this day I've always told people it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no oral dialogue and only thought dialogue, I found the movie to be confusing and I found myself breathing not to make any sound. I would highly recommend this movie, I wish it was available on DVD.
