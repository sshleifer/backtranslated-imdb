Foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp is apparently "perfectly" fit together. Shot by shot, edit by editing, unfolds the film around a disturbed boxer who discovers his own purpose (or lack). The other comments around may show a lack of pulp interest, but I personally think this is a fantastic composite filmic piece!
