A charming little movie in the UK about reuniting another world war all girls (almost) swing band. A fine cast of oldsters brings light-hearted perspectives on the life of this fun tale with an award-winning performance by Dench and Laines always great "pipes". Time well spent and a fun watch for everyone.
