Personally, I think the film was done very professionally, I loved choreography and acting. The ground is also gripping and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional, and what I liked most about it is that it makes you think afterwards. Antonio Gades has definitely lived his role in the end, and I have to say that it is one of my favorite images, and Saura is a wonderful instructor.
