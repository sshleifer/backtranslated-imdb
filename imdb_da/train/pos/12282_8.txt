At first I didn't like it so much, even though I did. They did not include the third Trueba generation, the love between Blanca and Pedro is not well explained, and some actors were too different from what I had imagined. <br /> <br /> Later, I realized that if the movie had been more loyal to the book, it would have been like five hours, and it would be a little boring. Now I like it because my favorite people are there when I portrayed them. Clara really looks like an angel alive, and her introduction to the story of the movie was amazing, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I pictured her just like that, only in grief all over. Esteban finds enough. I never really liked his character, and even though I was interested in him, I hated him much more specifically when he hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting, and it also has a real story. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good, especially considering that it was a Gringo movie based on a Latin American Order. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, don't you think so?
