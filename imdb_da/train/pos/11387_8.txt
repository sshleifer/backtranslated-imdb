An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter living in Paris for inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street, and she thinks she can make her work even more popular to the public, for example. in a museum. Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as the artist Jerry Mulligan is just perfect for both singing and especially dancing. He also meets the maid Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron), who is engaged to her best friend. He can't help his feelings for this girl even after he has figured out who she is engaged to. Full of lovely romance and wonderful singing and dancing, this is a very good musical film. It can draw a bit with its dancing dream sequence, that is, The American in Paris ballet, but there is a good happy ending. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music, Scoring a Musical Picture, Best Writing, Story and Manuscript and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Director of Vincente Minnelli and Best Movie Editing, the nominated BAFTA for Best Movie by any source, won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy and was nominated for Best Director of Vincente Millenni (Liza's father).
