Once again Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a trip to the wild side. And the remarkable thing is literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai Hi-Society - stars and starlets, glam dolls and witch doctors, business tycoons and broker types, the whole smelly party - are in sharp focus here. In typical tabloid fashion, their worlds with each colorful story unfold a smart subplot in them. <br /> <br /> A struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting pregnant, the stewardess and her senior man, pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, journalists, and police chief; all shades on the display and countless shades in between. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar does a bloated job of digging the dirt on the drama king, dance kings, and living dead. Atul Kulkarni packs a blow, like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Concern Sen Sharma is effective as an ex-crime beat reporter, but she could have been dolled up a little in line with job creation and party circles. <br /> <br /> Very focused (maturity 140 min) and refreshing second movie, worth the money.
