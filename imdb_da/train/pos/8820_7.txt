I watched the movie while I continued to get started after major operations. While I knew it was just a "B" movie, a room western, I loved it. It may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it didn't hold my imagination and gave great escapism. Unfortunately, our society is so much available that discounting small trials is too easy. Just as I can enjoy a straightforward school performance by Shakespeare, I appreciate many levels of achievement for the sake of art. I am a policeman and found affinity with the retired LAPD. Dream as if he is haunting me that I will not be able to respond to the lives of others (or my own) during the crisis. while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth took out the bad guy (predictable) I needed a little happy romance where good can prevail. My world is really too cynical.
