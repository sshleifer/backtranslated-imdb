This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily shows that there are lots of manufacturers who create movies that are as visually brilliant as anything coming from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> A difference from the normal Disney fare is that this Dreamworks movie doesn't have a cleverly crushing comeback sidebar. And there are no sudden moments when the characters break into the song. I'm sure a scene at the beginning of the movie wouldn't be seen on a Disney picture: the birth of the Spirit. But it is tastefully done and not at all offensive. "Spirit" was a good fresh impression. Don't make me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of good animated fare. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
