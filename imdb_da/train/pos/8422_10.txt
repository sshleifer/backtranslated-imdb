An extra is required to play a general in a film about the Russian Revolution. But he is no ordinary extra. He is Serguis Alexander, former director general of the Russian armies, who is now forced to revive the same scene in which he suffered professional and personal tragedy, to satisfy the director, who once was a revolutionary in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander. It may now be time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate fight. This is a powerful movie with careful direction by Von Sternberg, who gives the greatest irony in Alexander's character in every way he can. Jannings deserved his Oscar for the role of a very moving performance that played the general at its highest and in its deepest valley. Powell gives an eerie support as the inhibiting instructor and Brent are perfect in their role with her face and movements, showing as much expression as Janning's love. All around gloss. Rating 10.
