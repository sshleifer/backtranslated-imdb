Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars are from CITY OF THE Living Dead (I wonder what Luca does these days, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey who child from the dark shadows that want to forget dark shadows existed. In addition, in the Thorn EMI video there is no music over the opening circuit ... but the music is good when it comes in ... with the Italian movies, the movies are not as good as the music ..

Alien answers which way are you going Tommy says West, so Alien say goodbye, I go east, so after a while the theme goes in the background Alien and sees Tommy sitting on a stone clapping a pet hamster ... tommy looking up and telling Alien what took you so long ... I love this movie ... It touches my heels rte The boy with the robot arm needs a father and Alien is designed to be Tommy's father in the desert. . . Oh yes, they need water too. . . not ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) in any way, but a silly western / post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and Alien and Trash and a couple of other good guys with an average chicken with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL that looks like Wez in Road Warrior. . .
