This movie is one of the many "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia in the late 70s and early 80s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and lightning fast martial arts. But unlike most movies in this genre, it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. When workers from a dye factory are forced out of their job by Manchu bullies, they hire a co-author (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them. When his attempt fails, he takes his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for the right. But instead of making him a Kung-Fu student, the master orders him instead to build scaffolding to cover the roof of all 36 chambers. Now it turns out that while performing these strange tasks (stacking and binding of bamboo coils) he learns the skills to be a Kung-Fu expert! It's like in the Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel Karate's basics by getting him to do routine household gifts - "Grow on, wax away" etc. There is plenty of great comedy from the beginning to the end, and lots of action at the end when Gordon Liu again faces his Manchu -plager. "This time it's not just tricks - that's the right thing!" Liu declares, proudly pounding his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you won't miss this one!
