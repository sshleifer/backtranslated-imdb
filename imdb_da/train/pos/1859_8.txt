In his direct debut, Denzel Washington takes a true story, which is also a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we expected from Washington's efforts, but now we see this touch as director. <br /> <br /> Recently, we have seen some of the catastrophic results of children who have fallen through the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmare that leaves horrible scars, but ultimately suggests the human spirit's triumph. We can nit select some initial betting problems with too many close-ups and not the best of editing these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that shape such power cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the Academy ignores this movie, it will be a travesty. This movie draws no blows and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually does not exceed a novel to the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to see it too!
