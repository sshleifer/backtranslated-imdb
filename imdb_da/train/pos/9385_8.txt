Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be with almost no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW supplies all these and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays an ex-marine who is injured in Lebanon, who is down to his last $ 5 after refusing a job on an oil field because of his bad knees. He rolls into Red Rock and fails by bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite as his most threatening - but still evil) for a Texas fireman. He pays him to kill his wife and makes it look like burglary. Only when he comes there just to check her out. She offers him double to kill Wayne. Cage will just get hell out of town with his free money and let the lovers of the sparring be. But a number of accidents and setbacks result in him yoing in and out of Red Rock back and forth. Eventually, this leads to an inlet with Lyle from Dallas (a cheeky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper), the REAL hitman from Texas, who offers to help without knowing he is making the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW never had a great release, and most of the audience discovered it on video or on cable TV shows. Seeing it in such a way can make it a television movie, but it's bigger than that. The smooth, slow direction, moody score and howling desert wind would all have made for a great movie in theaters, but the best thing you can do these days is to watch the DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> Only the weak point in the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's dull femme fatale with the unpleasant dive-ish hairstyle. I would definitely not fall for her, but if you assume that Nic Cage's character is in for militant lesbians, then you accept it anyway.
