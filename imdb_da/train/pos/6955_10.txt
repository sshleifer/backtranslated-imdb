My Super X boyfriend is a hell of a roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent and costumes Uma Thurman wore on hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underrated comedian actress, but she turned out all wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend. She was simply FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was also good as average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses all the time. The support was also fantastic, especially Anna Faris, who was extremely good (much better than in the Scary Movie franchise). Ivan Rietman did very well with managing this movie because if it wasn't for him and Uma Thurman this movie would not have done so well. This movie is clearly a 10/10 for it's cast (Uma Thurman), it's the director, it's script and from the original plot line. This film is highly recommended.
