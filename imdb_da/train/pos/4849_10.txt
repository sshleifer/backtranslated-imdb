Ghost Train is a treat for those who appreciate the typical 1940s humor. It incorporates World War II into the plot, but not as much as I originally thought it would, and the characters are a unique blend that plays their roles quite well. Askey, who plays the role of Tommy Gander, is illuminating the story for the parts that could have been done as boring or "pulling". The story of the haunted station is actually creepy, even for present-day standards. It's unique, and the way the characters communicate with each other is great to experience the mystery that is The Ghost Train. Gander is largely a nuisance to all the other members, while the rest go together quite well. He is always the center of attention and can be described as "annoying", but it is for those who do not appreciate the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes it sweet to see. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for Askey / Gander, this movie would be shorter in action, enjoyment and the result would not be so effective in my opinion.
