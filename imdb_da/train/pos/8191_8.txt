The impossible planet and Satan Pit together include the two best episodes of the 'new' Doctor Who's second season. Having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story translates the cause of Quatermass and Pit (1967) into an outer space setting where the history of the universe is intertwined with that of Beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional bond between Rose and Doctor, while emphasizing Rose's growing self-confidence and establishing her as a non-equal-but-but-there-partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is Matt Jones's elegant manuscript, which occasionally reduces excessive dependence on one-liners to the doctor and the notion of the entire role, especially the outstanding Shaun Parkes as acting captain Zachary Cross Flane.
