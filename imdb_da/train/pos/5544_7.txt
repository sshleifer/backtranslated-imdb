China, which was the lowest of the low, actually hit gold with this humble little thriller. They did the same year earlier with "Detour", which is probably one of the finest low-budget films ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a single film, filled with fog and shadows, a technique used by most poverty radio studios to hide the sets or lack thereof. But here it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Strength) lurches around the swamp that kills those involved in his erroneous execution of murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer. His ultimate sacrifice must be the ferry's daughter ..... he concentrates his anger not only on those who are directly involved in his destiny, but also in their relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche makes her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style. She sets herself up to strangling to stop the murder, but as a public garbage, her gesture looks strangely good as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the next, something chastened. If Ulmer (who has instructed "Detour") has instructed "Strangler", she would hang from the nearest tree and the stringer's work would be done. But who complains? It is not the story that is the biggest attraction, but the wrapped sets, lighting and the general mood of the play. It stands just behind the detour, as the PRC's finest hour
