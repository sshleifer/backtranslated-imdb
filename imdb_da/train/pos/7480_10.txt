This movie is one of Tom Cruise's finest movies. He captures the audience's imagination with his role as David Aames. His character can be related to us all in one way or another. The story is very smart and keeps the audience on the edge of the film. I have never seen cruise film so much before, but after seeing this, it shows me his true talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end, where everything comes to a great conclusion and he finds out the truth. If you haven't seen this yet, you should definitely try. It is one of those films that when you start to see it, just watch it at the end or it will keep you in mind and you will regret it. My opinion is that you just have to buy it and take a risk, that's what I did, and it became one of my favorite movies all the time. It is A * 10/10 I promise when you see it, it will stick to you and you will like it forever.
