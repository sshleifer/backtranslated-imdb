I immediately noticed that this movie wasn't really based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had their own puppies. The sweetest of the Dalmatians was, of course, little snowball that was completely unspoiled until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed quite sweetly. In fact, I have often thought of the possibility that she could be kind, but now that she changed so quickly to "herself" and announced that she was Cruella once more, I almost started to be very concerned about Chloe's Dalmatians. <Br /> <br /> In fact, the scene where puppies looked at Lady and Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner was much better than I expected. I was also fond of the parrots playing to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was happy that the Dalmatians at the end were rescued, but I wanted to know what would happen to Cruella after she had lost all her property. And what in the world could the dog's home do with such a large sum of money? Finally, it was quite touching that Snowball also had stains at the end of the movie.
