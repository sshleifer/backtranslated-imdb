First, this should not be a brilliant and thought-provoking movie that so many other reviewers seem to compare to. The first review says something to anyone who likes it, by nothing about the horror cinema, apparently it is the other way around. Looking back for the movie, it wasn't supposed to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But really it was all it was aimed at, it was supposed to blow the viewers away with pure shock value (and all the errors, its pictures were much less visible back in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave this a high score because it reached its goal, and even though it was not just terribly horrible (without any sense of shock), it made me a little sick and thoroughly paranoid / pessimistic (I didn't "I trust someone for about a week because I didn't want to wake up and tortured)
