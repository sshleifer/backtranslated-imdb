I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the play and it moved well together. The director really seemed to understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one comes out today, of course they had much more money to throw at it, but were very attentive. When you watch a movie like this for a small budget, consider it when you see it. There were some things that could have been better, but most are budget-related. The action was pretty good, F / X and stunts were well finished. A couple of standouts was the guy who played the camera. and the boy who played the baby. These kind of movies have kept LA working and it's one that turned out OK.
