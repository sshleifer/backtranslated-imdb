This is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small England town. One finds a passionate love and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor. When tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Definitely a movie to have a box with you! A strong job. This is definitely one of my favorite movies all the time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The protagonist is taken by his young, beautiful piano instructor and a passionate romance flower. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank that quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one foul stroke. Ultimately, an unexpected surprise pulls them back together (in my opinion, her forgiveness is not justified)
