I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the "Dark-Heart" character is a little on the rough side, and I don't like the way he turns into a "medium" seed, fox, boy ?? I was wrong, this movie was made for my child, not for me. She "gets it" when it went over (under?) My head. Of course, I don't understand "get it". This is not one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy. This is right for the young, and the crew knew what they were doing. There are no political junkies. There is no magic key that saves the world from ourselves, no one has the right to access excess, and everyone is not happy all the time. And as an advantage, NO DIES! ?? russwill.
