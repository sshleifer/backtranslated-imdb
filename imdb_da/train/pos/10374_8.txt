I sat right through a very entertaining, fast paced 45 min. ROLL. Role is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone), who has dreams of becoming a sports star. Food travels to the city and must be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and delivers to him. Needless to say, Mat is being pulled into George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some morals and respects while George teaches how to relax and enjoy life. Toby and Damien were well thrown together and did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Each character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two policemen were great. David Ngoombujarra brought a great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a sympathetic gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite people 'Pando' from Two Hands. One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it showed the cities I grew up in and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see the sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks' n Rolls
