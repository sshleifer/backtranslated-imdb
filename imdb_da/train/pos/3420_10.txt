This movie is a must-see movie for everyone. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the soldier's point of view, just like everyone in America. The previous reviewer missed the point altogether - the intention is to reveal the truth of teaching our soldiers to kill non-terrorists, but living in our "enemy" territory and what it does to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home immediately before another person is killed or wounded. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are mentally injured, with ptsd post-traumatic stress disorder or physically with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
