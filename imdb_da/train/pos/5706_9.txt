Had this movie been made a few years later, I would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was pretty poor. At times, the film seemed to be a silent movie during the intervening scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). But since it was 1931 and a French movie, it is quite forgiving. Especially since this also happens in later French films - at which point the sound problems should have been completely prepared (as in L'Atalante from 1934). Okay, apart from some minor audio issues, this is a cute little movie about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search, there are lots of small and small songs that you can't help. A lovely charming movie all-in-all.
