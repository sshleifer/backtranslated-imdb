There is so much to love in this treasure little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or purchased a house, or even just been insufficient for space, will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the hitherto unknown Mr. Blending.Melvyn Douglas, with great comic flare, both stories and acting as a mix lawyer and voice of reason. As well, Myrna Loy is her best as a pretty scatterbrained but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grants. He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the hands of a housing shortage after the end of the war. The themes are universal, lack of money, labor strain, fear of infidelity. Yes, it seems carefully, but you have to remember that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. It's still relevant today and I have to criticize the bad reviews I see for a current preference for dumbed down, brutal out comedies. The look of the movie is slick and there are some good pieces of comedies, especially at the beginning. Although it may have lost some of its social relevance, it is almost fifty years after it has been deleted, it is still a gem.
