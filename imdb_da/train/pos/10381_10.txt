The previous reviewer has said it exactly. I saw it once, was enchanted, saw it another time when it was re-released within a week or two of the first aeration. I still remember some of the scenes. The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is World War I. One of the scenes was put in a woman-only section in a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment one of the women first touches the other is one of my all-time big movie moments. I am not thinking of this as a "gay movie", it is an interesting and tender period of love story where the two principles happen to be women. I would love to watch this movie again; I would buy this if it ever came out on DVD.
