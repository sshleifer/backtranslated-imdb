Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, who rents an apartment in France. The former tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt. He goes to see her there where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone.Hes and Stella's friend gets pretty close. Lets Simone die. Trelkovsky starts thinking about the landlord and the neighbors try to shift him into Simone, so in the end he will also jump out of the window. Loc Locateire (The Tenant) from 1976 is the last film of Polanski's apartment logistics. The former were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanski does not only do good work as a director, but his plays are also fantastic. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. The homeowner Monsieur Zy is played by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. The amazing Shelley Winters is the Concierge. The tenant is something very scary from time to time. It gives much of the psychological scare. This movie is not the easiest to understand or explain, but that makes it all so fascinating.
