There is nothing that doesn't like Moonstruck. I am from an Italian family in New York, and I actually get a little home bulb when I see it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor .. they were all amazing. It starts a bit slowly, but a lot happens in the two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. On my favorite movie list, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a "good movie" where you leave the theater that "burns amore" or repeats some of your favorite lines: "old man if you give them another part of mine food, I kick you until you're dead "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who is dead", "you love him Loretta ..... good because you drive you because they know they can". I always put on Moonstruck when there is nothing good to see because it makes me happy.
