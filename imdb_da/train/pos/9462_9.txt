Clean family oriented movie. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I couldn't see Steve Carrell as anything but goofy Michael from The Office. Boy, was I wrong. He had to win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he is not in movies of this "type". I saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range, and we all agreed that it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. Only 1 cuss word! Not even sure why it was PG13. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
