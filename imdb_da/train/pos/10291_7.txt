After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that had something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carry's best performances, but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll at "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like director Tom Shadyac's movie selection. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three of them and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story where it's hard to find. My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I remember only three specific biblical references, and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first versions of the manuscript had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid to offend people. It's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My character: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
