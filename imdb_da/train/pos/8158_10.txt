"Fear of a black hat" is all that (much weaker) "CB-4" should have been. Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless as he folds, spiders and mutates all aspects of hip-hop trends and culture. Similar to "FoaBH" Spinal Tap? Yes a little. Is it derived from Spinal Tap? No not really. The goal is more focused, the satire is better focused, and to be honest it is more fun.
