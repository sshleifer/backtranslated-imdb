YETI deserves the 8-star rating because it is one of the biggest bad movies ever made. I saw it at a midnight screening in L.A. and people roared and cheered on insanity - this movie is one of the cinematic train wrecks where you think it can't be a stranger and it does! The millionaire who finances the project to defeat the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into a bad fit - the guy who plays the researcher is one of the worst actors ever shown on the screen - and yes There is a mute boy (who sorta looks like a girl) and he has been silly ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm - perhaps therapy for the baby ??). Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by the Yeti (when he thongs - who takes FOREVER) - and he is immediately in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes" with her - It's like a big Barry White is trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, when the big Yeti picks up the hottie and has her on her chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple and yes, it takes the movie to show her big gray nipple. Yikes of all YIKES! Plus, there is a collie dog in it because the Italian manufacturer must have heard the American audience as dogs, and he has sorta tried to get a Lassie - there is also this crazy scene where yeti eats a huge fish - keeps the big fish meat and use it to comb the Italian girl's hair "Gee, thank you Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like trout. You're the best." This movie is more bizarre than anything Ed Wood might have dreamed of. If you are a fan of classic cinema - look this baby out.
