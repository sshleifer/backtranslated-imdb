Wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one beyond the consistent positive reviews I've read. It turned out I could never have imagined this movie because it is very close to "The Bride with White Hair" in being operational and dealing with the amazing. This goes a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old-fashioned ghost story tale. There is nothing scary about it, it's not the theme, it's really mostly a love story that deals with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost who is in many problems with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the ghost. This is also happening in ancient China, with wild foreign Kung Fu exhibits, and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are the top rate all the way. I could see this genre of Chinese movies all day because they are extremely entertaining, handsome visuals and pretty much heavy-on-cheek. And I'm looking forward to seeing the first sequel to this movie as well. Highly recommended.
