Don't make a mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most beautiful Jane ever, and there will never be even more outstanding. She is visually stunning. On the other hand, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. It has not only the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feeling of the continued saga. We become involved in the two white hunters seeking ivory, one of those in love with Jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best-defined and best studied in film history. And these characterizations are what make this nice action flick stand out as a classic. There is the unpleasant racism depicted. But the Africans are depicted as individuals, and eventually two become even more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, the one who is not named probably produces more sympathy from the audience than any other sign. The final is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The large foliage attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well understood by character reactions more than a modern goref movie would do with graphic depiction. If I left something, it's because I don't want to ground the image for those who haven't seen it. But that's all you could want in a movie.
