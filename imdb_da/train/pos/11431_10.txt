My 3 year old French classes have always had this movie a lot. In a multicultural city school, the film gave many topics for discussion (in French in class, but I know that many discussions took place in English after the class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to the one between Protée and France. I've always mentioned that I felt this movie had one of the "sexiest" scenes I had ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African-American called out "Yes!" when he counted on the scene: the one in which Protée helps Aimée lace up in the evening dress, both examine both reflections of the other in the mirror. Directors use the "mirror technology" when you then focus on the inner conflict on one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique and it is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students had difficulty understanding the end of the movie. It was suggested that a theme in the movie was "Africanism", and that no matter how much you loved Africa or Africans, one cannot "become" African (as the driver tried to do): one must be African.
