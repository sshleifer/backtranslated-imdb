A woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. They were both alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in a package - he was able to pull the sword off his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadly weapon inside his body. First, he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. Just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches justice .... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is actually true because it is not like Hollywood movies that character does not try to Kill Someone - Sasha (he is the greatest hero traded by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who, in his opinion, deserves to die, but is blamed by authorities and runs. In such a runaway from authorities and mafia, he meets a girl (acted by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else must be seen ... not told. Be aware that this movie is more about emotions and emotions, but not about actions. This movie is full of pain from the protagonist full of him and his understanding of life.
