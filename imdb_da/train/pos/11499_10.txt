Since only one toddler, since this show originally broadcast, I recently just downloaded the DVD set and wanted several episodes filmed. This show was a 70's version of the pop TV 90's "X-Files" TV series - but with a slightly more comical / light hearted approach. But don't make me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes where many have some pretty big reasons (back to the imagination of course - that was the early 70's television). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots are a bit stupid as well as the actor, but this is the charm and attraction of this series. Whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies or sci-fi / horror themes, this series brought it all. Each episode clocked in about 50 minutes or so (1 hour of advertising) and that 50 minutes goes fast, leaving me always more. An amazing classic show that is undervalued in my book!
