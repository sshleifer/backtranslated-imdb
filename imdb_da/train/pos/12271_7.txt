Talk about a blast opening, "Trampa Infernal" has the coolest opening points ever! Guided by musical tones that may be slightly inspired by the legendary theme "Friday the 13th" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the player's names appear on the screen divided into giant syllables. Promising intro of an unclear Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller and it only gets cooler with every minute of passing. Two extremely competitive and testosterone-congested paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a blurred bar. According to a newspaper article, there is a missing bear loose in the nearby forests, and it has already killed several of the hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge is that the one who kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the largest set of balls. On arrival, however, it soon becomes obvious that they are not facing a bear, but a confused and complete maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his shed and several fighting tricks up his sleeve. After a decade of domestic and derived American slashers, this early 90-year-old Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and alive. The formula is simplified but effective, the main characters are likely enough, and the building up against the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably exciting. Maniacet must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasantly ugly and barbaric, which I really hoped for since the amazing aforementioned opening sequences and wasting a lot of free blood. The forestry and especially the camouflaged booby traps are pleasantly spectacular. "Tramp Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper hit that is highly recommended to fans of the genre.
