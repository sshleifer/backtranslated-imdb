This movie gives the saga a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, are the key figures. As the Civil War closes, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamics would be improved if people were to follow the advice: "Go West Young Man", which, mercifully, the film did not mistakenly attributed Horace Greeley as a number of others did. But then he is murdered, and some financiers wonder that they can get rich sales weapons for the American Indians. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock interacting with a little boy while a steamer is loading at a dock along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an "Arkansas Toothpick", which was in fact another type of knife, although both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Finally, Hickock meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to photographs and paintings of the actual man. Cody just got married and brings his bride to the old west to settle down. <br /> <br /> When they get to their destination, they run into Calamity Jane, who is in love with Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is that your mopsy?" The line was one that caused the Hayes Board any problem since a definition of "mopsy" was the prostitute. Demille wanted the line in, and one of his helpers pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books on Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit with bad virtue". It worked; the line remained. <br /> <br /> The Indians were restless, partly because of the superior weapon they got from the Eastern Finance Agent. Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area so troops could safely come to a siege area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who led some of the hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Calamity Jane gets caught and Hickock gets caught and tries to save her. They are brought to the boss and although there would be no talk, torture applied to Hickock breaks the Calamity Jane's willpower and she tells the Cody route to use. <br /> <br /> The two are released, and Hickock joins Cody and his forces, partly to warn them that they are entering a trap. With Hickok's help, they keep the Indian attack away. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to go after the pistol runners and finally catch them. As they wait for authorities, Hickock is shot down by being shot in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> There are many historical anomalies in the movie, but it retains the physician's taste. Pretty good for the 1930s.
