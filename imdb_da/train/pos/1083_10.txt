Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. An achievement worth Oscar consideration, but once again dismissed by the Academy. Mr. Grant runs the gamut from stupid to tender in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city. The pitfalls of building a home are well-synchronized and became the foundation (solved) for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle, "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you like good old-fashioned comedy without curse and gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see.
