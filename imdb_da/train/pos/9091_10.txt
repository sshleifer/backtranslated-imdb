A fabulous movie. With everything you could want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and lots of other action. Suspense and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> It's like an old swashbuckler movie. Entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was quick and you never get bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of problems in the royal household. The actors are beautiful and the set is magnificent. The costumes are spectacular, and the stunt work is imaginative. The special effects are also amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and beautiful to look at. He looks like a safe bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he usually is. He is one of our great players. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even making an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I found out that the movie has won numerous awards and I can see why. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fantastic independent movie. See it for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a TEN + !!!
