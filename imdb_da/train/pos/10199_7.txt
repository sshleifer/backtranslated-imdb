As a child I loved this game. I played it a zillion times in the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze, and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it, we never seemed bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this once existed. <br /> <br /> You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have interrupted the power to take the evil ones in their own way. There are 8 levels to work through in a worn and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating all the evil and the ultimate boss is very fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck evil in the holes down the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad end' where you become the chief of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery when you destroy the syndicate on the way to Mr. X, but never mind. Streets of Rage also has really great music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro made absolute miracles with the limited technology of Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I am proud to have this on my console forever. But with Streets of Rage 2 it is also possible to make the first a bit outdated. <br /> <br /> Benefits: <br /> <br /> Average graphics, but nice backgrounds represented in a comic book as panel progression that fit the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Big tunes. <br /> <br /> Easy to get into and difficult to lay down. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> Far subordinate to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2. </ p> <p> Bad enemy AI. Baddies often go away from you instead of taking part in a fight. This is particularly worrying with the Level 5 woods. <br /> <br /> Lack of combo movements. <br /> <br /> Missing decent weapons. Bad guy models are repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A-Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B-
