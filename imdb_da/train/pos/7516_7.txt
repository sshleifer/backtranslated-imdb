The first two thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page is very interesting. Betty, portrayed with great sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-next-door-type, who saw nothing wrong with what she was doing (and certainly there was nothing "wrong" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreates Betty's America by blending old black and white stock footage with new broken black and white footage. When Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's fame was mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, with a great performance and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage shooting sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early suppliers of fetish material are not portrayed too overbearing, and we get the feeling that these people were part of a tight "community". Betty never had too much of a problem with her infamy, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the equilibrium world. Because the film's third act is largely non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have seen a document length on Betty Page instead of a structured drama. Missing aside, it is a movie that is worth catching and represents yet another nice feather in producer Christine Vachon.
