This show is beautifully done. When it first came out, I was no more than a merry family comedy with very few good one-liners. It also seemed to express many families really well, with different concepts of both parent and child, but as I said, I never thought of it again as a good watch on an evening. But my view was shot out in the second window when the dramatic death of John Ritter's tragic death occurred. The program stood for it and really praised the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admirable oddities of John Ritter, a great actor with the talent to do something. When the show was sent after Ritters passed, I would just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought this shine cast the three children's plays, especially Bridget's character, worried about the last words she said to him. It reminded me that no matter what terrible things I say to my father, I don't mean them, and it's very important that he knows. Great Show
