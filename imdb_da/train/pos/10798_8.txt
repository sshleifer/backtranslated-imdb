First, this pearl from Joe Sarno looked far back then, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the movie was a bit slower than I would expect for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer made her the first time I ever saw her anywhere, I sat and noticed. Her presence in this movie is hard to avoid and spice up in every scene she's involved in. I've seen most of the rest of Sarno's movies, and the other movies with or with Jennifer Welles, and I have to say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best. Sarno's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is amazing, and Jennifer showed (figuratively and literally) a play that makes this a must see. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both frequent co-stars of Ms Welles and also frequent stars of Sarno's work, make in credible performances as a couple of adventurous, yet ordinary housewives. This movie is Sarno classic.
