This short film, which inspired the soon-to-be full-length feature - Spatula Madness - is a fun piece that contradicts similar cartoons that give more authors. Short film stars Edward the Spatula, who after being fired from his job, joins the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for some fun content near the beginning, but is hardly present for the rest of the feature. This movie's 15 minute run time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedies and a small musical number. Unfortunately, not much else lies under it. The reason created has no real time to show. But it certainly goes well with many high-budget Hollywood movies. This movie is worth seeing at least a couple of times. Take it to what it is and don't expect a deep story.
