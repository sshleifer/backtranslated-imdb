Ruling over me (the title after whom song) is a movie that will surely bring a tear to almost everyone's eye. It was a moving story of a guy (sandals) who lost his family in the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks. Years later, he runs into an old college roommate (cheadle), whom he doesn't even recognize because of the post-dramatic stress caused by the loss of his family. The two regain their old friendship and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes that he must get Sandler's character, Fineman, a little help before it's too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie that made me cry for a long time. It is totally worth seeing and after seeing it, I am positive, the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more.
