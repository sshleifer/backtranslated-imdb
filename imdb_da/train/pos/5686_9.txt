* Wonderland SPOILERS * July 1, 1981: Five People, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) are attacked while sleeping and brutally hit the head with steel pipes in their home on 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. <br /> <br /> Main Suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a 30 cm long dick and now a hopeless addict. <br /> <br /> Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine) are investigating the case and trying to crack it by a witness claiming that John at least participated in the killings David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's girlfriend and trying to get a witness report from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holm's 19-year-old girlfriend and from Susan, who unfortunately can't remember anything more than shadows at night her husband's head was bashed in and her almost suffering the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a great drug kingpin (who is always around ladies like Barbie (Paris Hilton)) comes into light as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know anything about it? 'Wonderland' is a taught, intense excitement, a desperate love story, and a story of a man's sad decline all in one; there is a clever use of the 'Rashomon' technique (we see the events of the fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very short) and Sharon), a good direction and a good script, but most convincing for the performances, especially Kilmers, who takes the central step with his hopeless, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas', if Launius is strangely prominent, Kudrow's strong Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Dawn. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
