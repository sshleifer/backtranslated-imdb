I LOVED this movie! I'm biased to see, since I'm a big Disney fan, but I've really enjoyed myself. The action starts running at the beginning of the movie and just goes on going! This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they don't spend as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out) and there are no music tracks. It's strictly action adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, they are young or old.
