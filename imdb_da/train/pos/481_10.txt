This is one of the unusual cases where a movie and the novel on which it is based are both good. Perhaps this is because Gorris' takes Nabokov's original ideas and gives them another interpretation. The final consequence is a point of view over Luzhin, who deserves him more than Nabokov's one. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like in the movie is Valentinov's influence on Luzhin's destiny. I can't imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so much influence on the novel's argument.
