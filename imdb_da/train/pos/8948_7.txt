It's the kind of movie that, if made today, would probably be the star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; In fact, when I think about it, it's probably one thing that has been raised to be restored one day. It is comfortable but without depths at all. It suffers from the almost deadly miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years old, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs is in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, the only actor in the film whose performance is approaching what one might call "white". (** 1/2)
