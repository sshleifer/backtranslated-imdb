In this series of the series, Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency period in Britain (in the later part of George III's rule). This time, Blackadder's outlook is much poorer - as instead of royalty, he is a servant of the very, very thick George IV (the price ruler). Unlike George IV's historical accounts, this one is as bright as a tomato, and as a result, Blackadder can take advantage of him and plan the contents of his heart. The only big difference in style between this one and the past is that the series ends in a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it believe it. Apart from that, all the usual story elements are there and the show is fun. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not appropriate for the kids because of its raw language and adult situations.
