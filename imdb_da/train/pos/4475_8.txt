The United States still fought for World War II (the film was released between VE day and VJ day). Any studio that was worth the salt did either fighting films where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy or the Americans generally sang and danced. Technicolor Musicals was what America thrived in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most musicals today were simply a bunch of musical tracks tied together with the best available plot slipping in to fill the time for the next musical song! I get the feeling now that the people going through this movie were all born after 1970. Depressing how fast we forget. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been called "The Search for Jose Iturbi" but now everyone is wondering why. Allow me to explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the finest pianists to reach a concert stage. He went in to make a few movies in 1942, but Hollywood had been following him for almost a decade at that time. Not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful leader, Iturbi was much more than a household word for more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was scheduled early - and has no one ever noticed the other pianists were all kids? Joe Pasternak, who produced the movie and many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in classical music. Grayson wants an audition with Iturbi in the movie, not unlike real life at that time. Everyone wanted Iturbi then. The ghost among soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he made many concerts on military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a fantastic dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but once this movie was made Sinatra was just under 30 and had only been contracted to Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbi had been a worldwide feel for 20+ years. <br /> <br /> And as for the lack of a plot, the Americans didn't need a plot. They were tired of war, they were sick for fear of their loved ones and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work fine in the end. They needed music and smile and joy and romance. This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lecture. Mouse dances aside, the best scene in the movie arises between Sinatra and Iturbi, each of which "ignorant" complements the other music. <br /> <br /> If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi, the Spanish who conquered more of America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon together, please visit my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a map overview, excerpts from movie reviews of the day and pictures from this and some other MGM musicals from the 1940s, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
