I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After seeing the first episode, I could see why people were turned off first. The first episode's humor is not the best and they struggle to start the series properly. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude to the show. The characters evolve much more after the episode and become really fun characters. As a first episode, it doesn't really represent the rest of the show, which is really pretty good. The section is not bad in any way, but when the show progresses, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before deciding on the quality of the show.
