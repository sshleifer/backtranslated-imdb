Like many of you, I am a big fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir films - but Red Rock West was a really good experience for us all yearning for the past. The term "neo-noir" is so often used inappropriately for the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserved to be described as such. The molding is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The reason is so tight that you are connected within the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated it. Many modern films leave me wondering why they don't do them as they used to, and I'm not even that old. Films like Red Rock West give us hope for the future while we pay tribute to the past.
