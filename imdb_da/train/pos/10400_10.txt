Probably the finest fantasy film ever made. Sumptuous color, spectacular set, incredible spot-on Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for every scene and mood. The action is also fantastic in what could have been stiff and pretentious in smaller hands, but here is the poetic dialogue talked sensitively (humor is also subtle and lovely). <br /> <br /> Doubtful Spielberg and Lucas were thrilled by this. Along with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two finest movie films published by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the best movie images ever made. <br /> <br /> A true, compelling classic!
