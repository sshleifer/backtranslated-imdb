A complex story based on Bharat's division. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl and a trained Hindu who burns a Muslim harvest harvest - but eventually you end up suffering both of them. The story is powerful, but the manuscript and stream are hesitant. Background music scores and songs are excellent. Next comes memorable plays by veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography takes time, violence and the taste of rural Punjab very well. Other players have also not acted well or did not get the chance to act. Direction is really the weakest connection. The signs were not well developed. Not sharp, unlike "Earth", where even a 5-line sign leaves a mark. The end is very interesting. This story could have several different conclusions - and everyone could have been just as good.
