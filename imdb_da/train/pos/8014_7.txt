But if you like muppets, I defy you not to like this. Basically, the same plot is regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) it has many fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx. A lot of muppets leave the movie pretty early, as it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I have the case a lot. Fun to see with your kids.
