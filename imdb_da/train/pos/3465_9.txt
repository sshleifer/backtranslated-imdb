I sat down to watch this movie with very scared and little hope. I didn't think it would be possible for this movie to live up to its subject. But it did it completely and saw some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job like John Lennon. At times, it seemed that Harris channeled Lennon. The equality was often eerie, and he clearly studied Lennon's way and vocal bends. Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, who also had a striking resemblance to Macca, although he sometimes dared to take his scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This work of fiction was well-written and orderly. It was of course pure imagination, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur looking through a keyhole at this reunion. The rooftop scene was especially moving when McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child - that he was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents. I also enjoyed the scene in the park, where the couple danced with absolute surrender to the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be: I'm not so sure that John was as caustic as he was portrayed in the movie at this stage of his life. He had settled into his home situation quite nicely, and he was actually known to be very kind when approaching fans. Only a few years later he was very kind when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph the day he was murdered. Mostly, this movie to touch these feelings again about what might have had John lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would have come back together at some point. And I'm sure Lennon and McCartney will still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I want to see it again and again. <br /> <br />
