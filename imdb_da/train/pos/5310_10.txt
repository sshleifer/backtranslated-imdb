Pecker is another mainstream movie by John Waters made on a less than serial drama. Pecker's title character has a hobby about taking pictures of everything he sees. It does not matter whether it is dirty or shocking when taking pictures. He quickly uses the pictures he has taken and puts them on the screen of his work. Pecker lives in a half-normal middle class family. His father works on a drinking rod with a claw machine, but doesn't make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street. His mother runs a shop and loves to dress poor people. His older sister, Tina, works at a gay bar where her specialty is trading. His younger, little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sweet food. His grandmother Memama has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with it. He also has 2 friends. On his friends, Matt is a chronic shoplifter, and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a clothes mat as if she were a dictator. Soon, a tourist from New York buys her pictures and shows them at an art gallery. With the picture comes fame, but the images reveal the unusual lifestyle of his friends and family's simple life. For an R-rated movie, Pecker is certainly tamer than most of Waters' former R-rated movies and even Pink Flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!
