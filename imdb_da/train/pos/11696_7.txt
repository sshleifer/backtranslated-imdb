"A Thief in the Night" is a film that was generally ignored by film workers as a whole because of its low budget (which was evident) and its subject - Rapture of True Christian Church and the Fate of the Survivors. Nevertheless, it was a gripping story that kept the viewer and certainly made him or her review their relationship with Jesus Christ. It affected everyone - even showing a priest who preached the Word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This movie and its successor "Distant Thunder" have to watch movies. Even with the new series "Left behind", which tells the same story with a much higher budget, the effect is still the same. "A Thief in the Night" struck the ground for this genre and will always be remembered.
