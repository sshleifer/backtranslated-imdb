I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I couldn't stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the story, the characters, the setting. As for movies, I wouldn't call this a good movie, but for what it should be, it's great. It makes it mean across. The cast may be as good as anyone ever put together in a comedy film. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are fun. For this that hasn't seen it, I'll give you a brief summary: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank hoist. But when their friend is arrested by two police officers chasing him from New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and the whole hell is loosing itself. The movie is really a big bank caper comedy and is like a poor man's version of Ocean's Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all, if I want to laugh, I strongly urge you to watch this movie.
