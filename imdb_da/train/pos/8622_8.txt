I just can't agree with the above comment - there are lots of interesting and truly amazing cinematic pictures in it, it has an unusual structure and moves well towards a scary climatic sequence that is remarkable for the effective use of silence. In addition, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very honest way, not pulling any blows on what it shows, but does not live and over sensationalize the subject. It has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art house cinema and deserves a place among the cannon of "different" horror movies like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (of which it is going and could be an unknown influence on). It is definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the horror cinema's edges.
