There seem to be only two types of reviews of this movie online. Those who hate it and curse Ralph Bakshi's name and they love it and call it brilliant work. I tend to be in the middle. I have to agree with most of the criticism of this movie (eg, the gruesome cutting of history, badly rotoscoped charecters, over acting, etc.) But I still dislike this movie. Rotoscoping (when done right) adds a creepy, lively dimension to the charecters, and the final battle scene at the end of the movie is amazing. The surreal scenes when ninerider's chase Frodo is stylish and well done and the musical score ... magic. Unfortunately, the poor point to the weight film, but if you can bring yourself to ignore them, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> (Undoubtedly, I am thrilled by an angry crowd of people who hate this movie after writing this review, ah well, that's how life is)
