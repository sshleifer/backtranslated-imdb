The tighter the drama, the better the sister's rivalry movie! This little gem was primarily promoted as a comedy at the release in Sweden, so I'm happy to find that it wasn't quite the case. It is fun to look at fun bits in the small town, but drama takes a central step as the story progresses. And not just family drama, it also raises exciting questions about respect for different people's lifestyle choices. Great character ensemble with many amazing and moving dramatic scenes that score credibility points; And they are not just scattershot, but keep everything in place. It just makes me suppose that if Ingmar Bergman had done this (the drama fit him!), The international attention would probably have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
