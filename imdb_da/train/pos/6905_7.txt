I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played her role just as perfectly. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and comfortable with the role of time. As everything happens for a reason in life, I think he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there during the year as he did. I guess he stayed because he had to see how well his life was compared to the poverty he experienced in the Parador. I think he took too many things for granted in life, and he needed to get a serious check of reality by staying in that country as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ........... that's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
