This film brought tears to his eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the viewers' hearts and direct this wonderful picture where life is seen through Paulie's mind and heart. We discover from time to time using sensitive and talented instructors like John that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just couldn't stop my tears, even though the movie has a good end. It's good, after thousands of movies, I saw through my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is after the "Ugly Duckling" the second picture that really turned me up and down.
