The "Instant Gratification" era of horror movies will undoubtedly complain about this movie's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body counting. The fact is, "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be done. <br /> <br /> If you avoid indie holders because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings being killed by some baddie whose back-story could have been behind a Count Chocula box, "The Empty Acre" is the movie to you. <br /> <br /> Put into the past due remnants of the nationwide American dream, "The Tomme Acre" is the tale of a young couple struggling for their six-month-old baby. As the couple's weak conditions fall apart, a bigger story plays out in the background. At night, a shapeless dark mass looks out of a sunbathing barren acre on their yard and apparently turns off something in its path, leaving no sign that it was ever there. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with enigmatic characters and visual traces of what's happening, ending with a successful ending that resonates with just enough remaining questions to validate the author / instructor's belief in an intellectual audience. There seems to be a sub-text about the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the film an allegory. Riveting, well-acted and technically sparse, "The Empty Acre" is a great little indie that the thinkers of war should love.
