The 70s Show is the best TV show ever, period. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. The 70's show continued for 8 seasons, all focusing on a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships, differing from their parents and their overall futures. The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers living next to each other. They have lived side by side in most of their lives, and begin to feel more emotional at the beginning of the first season. Much of the show is about how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in service so he really pushes Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Although she drinks heavily, she treats Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, their neighbor, is of course Dona's father. Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the rough of the show's history. Bob also irritates red to its fullest extent. <br /> <br /> The remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie are Eric's friends. They also play a major role in the history of the show. <br /> <br /> Now the first season is great. This is where the characters begin to feel new things to each other. The first season is original, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, though not as good as the first. It is a fundamental continuation of the first. Eric and Donna are together and everything works well. <br /> <br /> Third Season is my favorite. It went back and caught the first season feeling and humor. I also think the character chemistry improved a bunch, which made the show so fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not that good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this, making the show a little less enjoyable. It's still fun, even though I didn't have it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> Fifth season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through. It's the band Senior Year, so it really helps with the story. The fifth season also had the best end of all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is good for the most part. It is extremely fun, even if it does not catch the feeling that the other seasons did. The gang is out of high school, so I think it didn't hit the teenagers that the previous seasons did. I also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering they had a big drama for them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season captures the same feeling that the 5th season had somehow, even though it didn't do it all the way. I enjoyed the seventh season as I did all the others and the end is amazing. The last season flat out sucked. Eric wasn't in it that destroyed it. Kelso wasn't in it either, which didn't help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good and an appropriate ending to the series. So in general, if you enjoy comedy, give it the 70s show a try. They stopped making new episodes, but it's still on a television set. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy season 8.
