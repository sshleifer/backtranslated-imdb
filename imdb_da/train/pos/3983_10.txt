Fully deserving of its prestigious Hollywood Award nomination, this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some wonderful surprises. Outstanding fun scenes include a hilarious shooting (and resumption) of a WW1 trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and the rude McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman messenger ?? all under Ralph Sanford's dreadful eye that is lovely irascible anguish; a lost McDoakes guided and re-led by equally confused Jack Carson; Deputy Director Chandler welcomes a McDoakes sent option: "I must be an instructor!" <br /> <br /> Ace comic O'Hanlon has a dual role, playing both McDoakes and even playing McDoakes! It's strange that Richard L. Just who plays in one or more other entries in the series has knocked down the opportunity here. In fact, just a young, six-foot Rock Hudson lookalike, but here he is imitated by veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
