I start by connecting my first meeting with Prince's music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl just danced breasted to "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer. Later I started to hear other Prince songs and really "dig" them. When Purple Rain came out, I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesota man. The movie blew me away. I immediately became Prince's No. 1 fan of "War Baby" generation. Later I found out that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she got me and my nephew a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to his mother ... how cool is it! Come back to the subject at hand, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought the Prince's play was fine, Apollonia struggled a little, but all in all it worked fine. John Gielgud was not available to play 'The Kid', so Prince took the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliant paced (it never gets slow) and terrifically directed. I rank it among the best movie musicians of all time. Last time I saw it was after about a 7 year interval and it still delivered. I am so proud of my colleague Minnesota Prince Rogers Nelson and would like to tell him personally. He went right in front of me during the above concert and said, "Hi" to my nephew, but not me. He was chatting with his mother. I was a little crushed, but he's still No. 1 with me.
