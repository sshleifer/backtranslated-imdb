Throughout this movie you may think that this movie is for children only. Well, it is mainly pointed to them, but it is also well rounded enough with the jokes also pointed to the adults in the audience. This time, the Muppet gang is trying to get on Broadway, with the gloomy alleys keeping them out of producing it, leading them to division. But Kermit does not stop, and his determination keeps things moving until after a deal he has been hit by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> <br /> In fact, part of the old 40s musicals with musicals are actually the subject of a musical, only here is the usual mass of zaniness and amazing moments thrown into a pot of hysterical fun moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish; Gonzo's water-point display, whispering campaign among many others) but also with much heart. The Muppet authors are not embarrassed by the conventions; on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it is almost refreshing to see such a "lets put on a show" story where through thick and seem the characters will fulfill their dream. <br /> <br /> Although not completely original as Muppet Movie, it has many captivating and memorable songs, excellent locations throughout Manhattan, and even some intonations of mid-species dating (and marriage)! Cameos includes Liza Minneli ("a seed?"), Elliot Gould (as policeman), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing, or just have many great laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.
