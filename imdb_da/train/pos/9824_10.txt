This flick is a sterling example of the condition of erotic B movies: bad porn movies without hardcore sex. The reason for this is not as bad as these things go; It involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent to kill her wife. However, the rest of the film leaves something to be desired. Poor acting, poor direction, poor looking woman, bad set, poor filmography, poor sound and bad sex scenes. The filmmakers must learn the difference between raunchy and erotic. They don't even have the common sense of having Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. How stupid is that?
