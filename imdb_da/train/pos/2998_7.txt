Enjoyed watching this movie on TCM and seeing a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) playing detective as he did with Myrna Loy in "Thin Man Series". Back in the 1930s William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous veteran actor Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case where a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) is found death and Archer was in a room bolted from inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) gave a great support role and was the brother of Frank Morgan, who appeared "In The Wizard Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in many of these Philo Vance films and also gave a good performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the most likely actor might well be the killer. Enjoy a good classic from the past.
