Sly is the best out and out action movie. It is an extremely comfortable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlin's direction is stylishly secured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action movies, and he certainly looks like action scenes. This was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable in the 90s, a particular genre classic. As a Stallone fan, it's one I look back with good memories. Lots of great action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all the characteristics that make a good aciton movie. The movie looks good and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
