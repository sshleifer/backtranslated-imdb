I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know she is also a great writer / instructor. I have been a fan since I first saw her in the films "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". It's so rare to see Lee Grant these days in anything. She has been missing on the screen for too long. It's also great to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit-com. This is her best work since "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you will love this movie. I didn't expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get the chance, see it.
