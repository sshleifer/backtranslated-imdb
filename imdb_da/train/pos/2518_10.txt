It's the best movie I've ever seen in all categories. Forget Hollywood - their movie is always sucked - it's art! Moon Child's story begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire who disguises what he has become and lives in denial. His desire for final death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here he meets Sho, an orphan on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the movie. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never have a movie touched me how this movie does. And the actors are amazing - never have I heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without it looking strange. A great praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... One last comment on this amazing movie is that it is Stars Gackt (ex-singer of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (singer for L'Arc ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent roles like Sho and Kei. I am amazed at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting, depending on the age he is acting out. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you never see any movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Everything in their original language, of course!
