It's fun how your life can change in a second ... To participate in '' The Waterdance '' for the first time, it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new lifestyle seem scary, and noting that there are other people going in a similar situation, it can help you continue. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances and mostly by Helen Hunt (oh man! Helen is the purest and graceful woman in the earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles . A movie simple and at the same time deep that doesn't make us indifferent to the message being transmitted: Enjoy every moment in your life ... Really for a movie like any hour is not present !!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian term ...).
