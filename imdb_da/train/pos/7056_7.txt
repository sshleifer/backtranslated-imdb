The sequel to the ever-popular Cinderella story reminded me a little about what they did with one of the Beauty & the Beast films. It's basically three short stories rolled into 1. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! He's sooo cute!), And Lucifer is amazing (as usual). I liked some of the newer characters too, (Pom Pom was sweet and I liked Prudence.). The story was still somewhat limited, but still very sweet. So I'm voting 7/10.
