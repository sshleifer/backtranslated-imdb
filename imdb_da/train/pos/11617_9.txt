The premise is simple. This movie starts to look like your average lama chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other at an airport, so things go 180 degrees ... <br /> <br /> I, for one, really don't like that mind numb love story nonsense that pollutes the average cinema. And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven, who builds on his former meta-horror film (Sceam), also does ... After this logic, it is not surprising to find out that Craven sartonically takes his time to build a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love' story only to get an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck the entire sugar-laden dreamworld ... The extent of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper, get it? lame, right?) in this movie is impressive he goes from being completely charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book. As he continues to freak out his victim (Jennifer Garner Lookalike Rachel McAdams, which I found rather annoying by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven who is coated in Jackson Ripner, through Cillian Murphy, bashing all brainless chick flicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, I greet you. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after knocking out Rachel McAdams in the plane toilet): "Thanks for quickie !!!"
