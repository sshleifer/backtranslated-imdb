I love this show. I look at all reruns every day, even though I've seen them all as 6 times each. <br/> <br /> It's about two sisters Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth) living in New York. Holly goes live with Val when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment on the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems Vall and Holly go through. The main problem is guys, but it's also about being responsible and other choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and is a total free spirit, while Val is the complete opposite. She is the organized must have a plan to do any person. <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
