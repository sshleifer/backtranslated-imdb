The first time I came to Delirious, I only heard it. I listened to the whole comedy show, and I have never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious images in our minds and make great imitation is captivating. When I finally got to see him do this action, I had to get it. Eddie Murphy's performance at Delirious shows his genius! With the new millennium his actions in 1983 are as fun as it was then. My parents loved it as teenagers, and I (age eighteen) love it too. From that point on, I had to watch Murphy's other films like Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There won't be any other comedian like Eddie.
