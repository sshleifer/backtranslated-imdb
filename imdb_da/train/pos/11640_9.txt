What I liked best about this movie is that like Hitchcock's movie, it's a thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people are in the movies to feel good. Something like Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but it has lots of laughs and always has an eye flashing on the camera. Rachel McAdams is amazing as always. Cillian Murphy is frightening than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy. We don't see much of it these days because I suppose the Hollywood agents consider it a bad career, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being poor. The management is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but the dialogue could have used some sprucing up. <br /> <br /> "Red-eye" is a really fun movie and people were appealing as the closing credits started rolling. If you're in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller, "Red Eye" can be your ticket.
