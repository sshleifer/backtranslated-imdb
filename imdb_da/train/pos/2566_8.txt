Any bigotry movie in a positive way is a movie still to be seen by current audiences, as history and morals will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie is really an old-fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl ... boy gets girl back .... The weakest role goes to late Kent Smith as Lt . General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is a close second) ... my question would be how did he ever become a 3-star general ... the character is such a glimpse into his wife and military subordinates, it's odd that they show him someone respect at all. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a bit exaggerated, and some scenes have a few holes, but generally I enjoy the movie every time I see it. Red buttons are amazing ... I always love to see comedians in dramatic roles ... as in Button's case, a comedian can often better portray a person's tragedy than a more traditional d dramatic actor.
