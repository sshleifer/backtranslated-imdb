If you haven't seen this great movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.) then you've missed a special treat. This is one of the most amazing and powerful films ever made about the lives of Americans in the 90s, and it even goes beyond today's world in which we live. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, land syndrome, egoism, etc. and the list goes on. This story builds on an ultimate climax and so when nothing else matters, it always goes back to love with friends and family and love for life. It helps us dig deep inside ourselves and make us search for what we want out of life. Ask us questions about ourselves. Have we done enough for others, are we here, etc. ??? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully finished and emotional movie that I am sure others will enjoy life. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover's wonderful performance throughout this movie. These actors are amazing and truly show the true glow and meaning of what message is sent to us all. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie over 10 years ago now. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it's symbolism for the movie ?? hmmm ... I almost forgot this is probably Steve Martin's very first serious working role in any movie he has ever done. He also does an excellent job in this movie. This can come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy really good movie making .....
