Definitely one of the most witty and twisted whom I have ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Very stylish sets and props really give a sense of atmosphere to the case. The minimalist feel works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not the movie itself, but the lack of a decent widescreen version of the movie on DVD. I own the fullscreen version (which shows that I love the movie enough to endure full screen presentation), but a fantastic Deluxe or "Special" edition would definitely get my money.
