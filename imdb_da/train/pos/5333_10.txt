How this has not become a cult movie, I do not know. I think it has unfortunately been overlooked as a truly brilliant comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to pass itself as a fast-paced thriller, but takes the quality of acting (good God, it's bad) story, practical features of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene in Considering there is nothing you can really do but laugh. And laugh you will. Movies are made to entertain us, and to what extent they do this can be an indication of the film's worth. This movie is the highlight of entertainment I laughed from the beginning to the end. At one point I got short breath and almost choked, it is really fun at some points. When the child was lifted out of the sunroof in a holdall with a helicopter with a robot pilot, which managed to maintain a constant speed identical to the car and a perfectly flat floating plain, which meant that the gripping hook did not scratch the car roof in pieces I laughed hysterically . But when the baby began to swing around in the air, almost hit a bridge and approached a tree, tears ran down my face. It also happened to me that the black policeman was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's "Like A Prayer" video. He seems to be everywhere.
