This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had more friends over one night and for some reason a channel had surfed for HBO during the evening. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" was on. I didn't try to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes. I didn't want to be held "accountable" for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that apparently killed me. Having kept my laugh more than it was healthy, I let go - like the others of us (we were not stoned, by the way, nor about insurance and pensions ...). We were choked after that. The story lines, the plot, the bizarre but brilliant connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance. I have since been dependent on all the Eddie-Izzard pieces of comedy I can get my hands on. His work is pure genius. His comedy seems effortless. He seems more like the hysterical fun friend hanging out on your house and wandering around here or that ... It's a lot of fun. He gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and even the only true aficionados of humor, after all. If you are disappointed with this video, you have no opinion on the penultimate in humor - or humor, as they say in the UK.
