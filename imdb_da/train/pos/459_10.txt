This is the best series of the type I've seen all year. I can't help believing it's just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year), and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows gets endless episodes. <br /> <br /> I believe many reasons New Tricks are successful. The scripts are good, and the mix of characters is great, The acting is top flight, and the mixture of comedy and drama seems a treat. The stories aren't all that memorable, but that's not the reason I see, show like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite and we were disappointed to find it unavailable in a published edition. Big things, the BBC - a triumphal sense of sex appeal (apart from the young constable there is no one like eyelid, and even though he is, he can still act!).
