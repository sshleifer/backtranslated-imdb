People tend to complain about the number of films made about mentally handicapped people. I cannot see this as a valid criticism, no more than complaining to many films about any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the manuscript and the direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, with Duquenne basically playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly large event and is not just happy to go over what was seen in "Rain Man". The end is quite depressing, but it does not destroy the wonderful story that has come before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
