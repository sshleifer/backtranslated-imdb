I purchased the DVD on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail upside down with this one. I remember watching the show when it was on TV but always wondering what happened to it. Ten years later, it's like seeing it all again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are good together, though they are some rivals. Almost well represents (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say that he has some special powers that I do not believe were given by any Holy One. He can make phones ring, write, or even cause a person's emotions to change. Nevertheless, there are a few episodes in which he actually becomes the good guy despite everything. All in all, this is an excellent series which, like many others I can think of, was canceled before their time I can think of (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) . Steven King's The Dead Zone seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to do it. There is just nothing appropriate for watching TV anymore. This is because all that is about Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately withdrawn from television. So in the meantime I just want to buy DVDs and watch shows that still have to be on TV, but were started by TV by religious jealousies so we could see "quality" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons lots of crap that is).
