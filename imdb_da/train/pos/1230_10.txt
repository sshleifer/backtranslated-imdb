After watching this movie for the third time, I think it's almost Adam's worst movie. PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is bad compared to this, I have to say at the end, when Dickie is thrown off the boat, it is so fun (the hair is different from his and I like it when he throws all out. This movie should only brought if you are a true Adam Sandler fan. <br /> <br /> The characters are poor compared to his funny movie like Waterboy, who has the same people in it (peter dante) who is one of the murderers trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks depth and a decent storyline and deserves to be in the bottom 100
