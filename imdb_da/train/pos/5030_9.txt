Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It wasn't the same old recycle file coming out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on video because I didn't even know it until I saw it on my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you won't regret it. The excitement builds all the way through, and the twist end is excellent. <br /> <br />
