Chris Gerolmo did not just give us a "Jack-the-stripper" type list of murdered people: he entered the psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps it is primarily due to Stephen's excellent performances that play against Donald Sutherland with good empathy for both. It was the game of these two parts ?? primarily ?? which made the film something more than just a morbid account of Rostov's butcher's history. Support actors, especially Max von Sydow, performed their parts really well. Good management. The photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was bound to produce a few aberrations, but frankly, we can completely forget this little triviality, given the depth of the narrative and interpretation. <br /> For once, one is made for television movies from HBO come up trumps. Recommended, especially if you like to analyze the character and forget some of the morbid scenes ?? As I rush to add, is never exaggerated.
