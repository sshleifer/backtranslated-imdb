A wonderful wonderful movie. You are held in a death grip when you let yourself be involved in the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is torn in a life crisis to balance his career with his family. He notes his former college roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attack on America, is no longer in contact with reality ... chooses to include his mind with his favorite music of the past and video games. The former roommates regain their friendship and strengthen their previous ties. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to bring Charlie out of his grief ... but it is Alan who gets to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder play the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Model and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack with bridal Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. NOTE: I have never been a Sandler fan; but I found him excellent in this role. In some of the scenes, I thought out loud ... why has he never been directed to playing songs / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic.
