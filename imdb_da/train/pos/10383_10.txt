I watched this movie in 1976, my first year in New York. I continued to live there for the next 26 years, but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful as this little TV movie. It was part of a PBS series that I remember and I have never forgotten. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, just delicate, moving, extraordinarily touching moments full of excitement and excitement, all within a conservative, Boston (I believe) World War I environment where women played the devoted wife's role pending the man's return from the war and did not seek a career and economic independence. Frances Lee McCain is great in the career photographer's role, and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles for no avail. <br /> <br /> There must be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD, but certainly at least one video?
