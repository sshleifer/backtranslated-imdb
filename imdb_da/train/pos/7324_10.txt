My personal favorite horror movie. From the long first tracking shot to the final stories twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece. Halloween night in 1963, little Michael Meyers kills his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, Michael rods and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It is Carpenter's almost exuberant atmosphere of fear that generates excitement. Like any big horror movie, the events are telegraphed in advance, but they still seem to happen randomly, and never give the audience the chance to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark lighting, the long stable camera images, and (most importantly) the horrible eerie music create the most claustrophobic and unpleasant scenes I haven't seen in movies yet. There is a body count, but compared to slashers slashers after this, it is quite small. That and most of the murders are almost bloodless. The fear is not in death, but without knowing. <br /> <br /> The play is round good. PJ Soles gives much of the movie's limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns a decent performance, and then there is the young (then) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and unsecured, but you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is self shy and unsecured and not at all prepared for what she should face. And of course there is the perfect cast Donald Pleasence as the particular (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a malicious error, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film many years ago, almost countless clones, copies, rip-offs and imitators have come together and stolen (usually badly) the best bit of the movie, until almost everything about it has become known. Combined with the changes for the audience's expectations and appetite, one finds much of the film's raw stream diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be seen as once unique. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have no reservations strongly recommending this movie to anyone looking for a good scary time. Highest Reguards. <br /> <br /> 10/10
