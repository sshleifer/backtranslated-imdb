This is an early movie "Pilot" for the hit Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to managers on a few networks before Showcase decided to sign up for a TV series. Great acting and a very fun cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two criminals are walking around and exterminating people's pets for money. If you have a dog next to whos barking all night, these guys are you going to! But they come into trouble when they come across a job too big to be able to handle and end in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> Rated for rape, violence and drug abuse. It is not for offensive either (they actually do not kill animals)
