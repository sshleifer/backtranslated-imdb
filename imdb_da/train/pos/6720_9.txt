Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary tracks the history of surfing and follows three other well-known and acclaimed surf films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, its follow-up Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son and Step into fluid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /> <br /> While surfing footage is spectacular, I appreciated the history of most filmmakers. He takes us back to the origin of the sport almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it evolved into its present form. This includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and artists, how surfboard design changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were most frequent by world-class leading surfers, and what an incredible adrenaline speed the sport gave them. The athletes lived for several months at a time on beaches, soured from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary berths, fished for food, and returned to their boards the next day. What a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost to the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suppose copyright issues can prevent crediting Beachboy's surfing songs like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. The surfing magazine and the Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the sports pioneers, their families, and how the current generation has benefited from the authors of the 1960s. One such story is how 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, regarded as today's greatest surfer, tied to a former leading surfer, introduced him to his single mother, whom he married before becoming his founder. <br /> <br /> An appalling musical background of contemporary music from all eras follows the story. Have I made your appetite? Wonderful. Get a good trip.
