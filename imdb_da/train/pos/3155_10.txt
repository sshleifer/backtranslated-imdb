I want "that the 70s show" would come back on TV. It was the biggest show ever !!! They should make episodes between the other episodes, but that would of course be confusing. But I want it to come back and make several episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely fun. You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really fun part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie went out with each other. It was the best episodes. "The 70's show is the best" .... It will and will always be the best show ever. It was really boring when the show ended. They should make new episodes.
