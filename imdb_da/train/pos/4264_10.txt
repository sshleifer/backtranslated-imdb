I happened to watch this movie twice or more and found it well made! World War II was fresh and the so-called "cold war" was beginning. This film can therefore be defined as one of the best "propaganda" patriotic films that prepare the Americans, and secondly, people from those still to form "Western NATO bloc" of countries to face the coming upcoming threat. The film celebrates America's power over the centuries while projecting itself to the current current war, which had just ended. Nice and fun is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent at Columbus, and pretty much New Amsterdam's 'episode' and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian. Must see it (at least once for the curiosity of the fashion of propaganda over time)! :)
