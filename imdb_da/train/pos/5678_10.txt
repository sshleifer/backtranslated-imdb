We could still use Black Adder even today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson, who resumes the role of assistant to the Prime Minister, played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as the dimwit Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode, like Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British thespian. Each time Edmund says Macbeth. The two thespians do a silly little action to ward off evil spirits. It's the funniest thing you want to see. Of course, none of this great and comical genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind the films like Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is fun and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and fun all. I was hoping last night on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie would pay tribute to his background in British humor. If the gang on SNL did some research, they would know what a treasure it was to have Hugh Laurie grace their scene.
