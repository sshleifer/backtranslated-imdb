Leonard Maltin must have seen another movie. (Although I find his guide to be a very valuable resource, please disregard his comments on this.) He says "good start, so fizzles" when it really is the reverse - "begin to be weak and then catch ". The reason is as simple as it gets. Happy Mom, Happy Dad and Happy Son take a vacation on an isolated beach, get inactive in accidents, mother run off for help, meet up with dangerous escape attendant. Mom tries to trick the beliefs into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life. <br /> <br /> good white knuckles given an electric shake of ralph meeker that suddenly appears (director john sturges, filming it in a smart way that makes you grab) about half way through the cunning, desperate criminals. Meeker is an exceptionally flippant, inconsiderate actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly"), and he is delighted to welcome the keys to the movie's story and quickly down with the top down. His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying "Pretty neat, huh?" when he is particularly pleased with his mistakes. There is a fun break in the action when they get a flat tire, and he immediately instructs his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Don't Get Away". She is burning back "Where am I going?" (they are in the middle of nowhere) and he understands sitcom-ishly "yes, that's right". The friction between them is a hoot. <br /> <br /> There are mistakes, a little ridiculous. There is a scene where the police, who have been hunting for Meeker for a while, stop Stanwyck's car and avoid discovery. Meeker rests her head on her shoulder as a loving man probably would and lay as if she were sleeping. A. He looks eye-catchingly in this position and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to be asleep during a law enforcement meeting would surely raise suspicions. <br /> <br /> Still a robust thriller that builds on an exciting and constructive conclusion. <br /> <br />
