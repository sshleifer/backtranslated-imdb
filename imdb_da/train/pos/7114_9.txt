Absolutely in the top five of the best John Garfield movies should be the Marines pride. It is the true story of Marine Private Al Schmid, who, at the expense of his own sight, while wounded by a storm of Japanese at Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is nicely segmented into three parts, Al Schmid's home life, where he is a simple work stiff who just gets serious with a woman and doesn't like anything better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he is out in war as millions of others were. The other part is on Guadalcanal, and we see part of the action where he is in an isolated machine gun that holds Japanese troops. His action prevented naval positions from being exceeded, but a grenade does so for his eyesight. <br /> <br /> And of course, the third part is his painful adaptation to civilian life and to assure himself that people don't just care about him, most of all the girl he saw Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This movie was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday, and there was a documentary about Garfield hosting his daughter. One of the interviewees said that Garfield was the most credible actor in the roles of the working class in holding and holding a union card. <br /> <br /> In that respect, he was lucky because he landed with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to get typecast in the gangster role in the tradition of the studio, Garfield was fantastic in those parts because of his background because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had, with the exception of Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In that respect, he was perfect to play part of a working class's whole as Al Schmid, who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. No super heroics here, just a guy who would rather have been back in Philadelphia but did a job to do. <br /> <br /> That's a big part for Garfield. It's a movie you shouldn't miss. I wonder what happened to the real Al Schmid.
