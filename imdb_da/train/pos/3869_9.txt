I've seen the movie at Viennale some years ago, where the audience liked it. I liked it too, the Summer Phoenix performance is still hanging on me, so I decided to write a comment. The story unfolds in London around 1900, when a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She desperately tries to become one, but it is not until a man treats her tremendously that she understands on stage that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and appears as a stronger person. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews where her performance was smashed, they accused her of being boring, unable to bring life to its character. I think it's her strong point, that's exactly what Esther Kahn should be, and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make her Esther a pretty boring girl. So her transformation at the end is stronger than it could have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> The camera is amazing, the pictures of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was then. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the movie you lose contact with the characters. After all, it's about finding the actor in yourself, so there's no dramatic action in the movie. It's Phoenix-credit that we don't lose interest in the movie after the first hour.
