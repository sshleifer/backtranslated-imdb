This is really an incredible movie. Not only does the eternal struggle for indigenous and disenfranchised people prove to have their rightful voice, but it also shows the United States up for its dishonesty, subterfuge and overt disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader who fights against what can only be described as a despicable elite without any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup as opposed to something previously seen. <br /> <br /> And in cross hair we see the United States, again pulling the strings and blurring all the reality. It is warmly to see the original phases of the rebellion knowing that the democratic breakdown we are witnessing is a tool slowly used by successive US governments and their seemingly flashing citizens. The recordings make it clear that this is not a manipulation of television or generic recording, but an active evidence of a people and its government fighting for its future. Really a moving experience for everyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long life Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to imagine the notion that each country should be allowed to choose its government and evolve in ways that the majority consider appropriate. The first phase of this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a good job of doing just that.
