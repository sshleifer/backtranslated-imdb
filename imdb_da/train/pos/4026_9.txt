Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It is a thought-provoking film that makes you think and cast doubt on our culture. It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date. This film should have been featured at film festivals around the world and I think it would have been a serious competitor in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly cast, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai jumped in their roles. <br /> <br /> The story movie tells about partition is a very important story and one that should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> It has no disturbances or prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is portrayed so well or badly. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistani and good Indians and Pakistani. The kinematics are excellent and the music is melodic, meaningful and joking. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the actor just took the breath. Everyone was perfectly thrown.
