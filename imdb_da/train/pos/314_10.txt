This show is a great story of history. It has everything from slavery, the way they were treated, religion, ways the Jews were sent hiding, the Inquisition, the belief in Orisha the African gods, the way women were treated, including daughters. Even down to homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined, and that Violante, the character, takes care of me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her. I am so happy that they decided to re-release it to t.v. again. Although I would love to see the raw version. Xica has become my heroine. I look up to how she uses her power to help anyone who seeks it. I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night. It would be great to copy it in English so that the Americans can also love her.
