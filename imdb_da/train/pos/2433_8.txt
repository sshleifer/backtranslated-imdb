I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Casper The Friendly Ghost" cartoon. Got it was early since Casper didn't look * right *, just as Porky Pig didn't look * right * in the old 1930s cartoons. But I decline ... <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode in the life of the friendly phantom relates to befriending a young fox todd, as he is called Ferdie. I remember being happy to see that Casper has a friend when those who have seen the drawings do not know that most people run away from him, screaming "A Ghost!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have fun together until someone else turns out ... I hate leaving you with a semi-spoiler, but the comic is only seven minutes long so you can't really be too ambiguous . Moreover, anyone reading the IMDb synopsis of the comic strip can derive what happens next time ... <br /> <br /> The final is a bit heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the coolest I've ever seen watching a cartoon. But that only means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Or it is the fact that I actually remember this cartoon at all because of its emotional effect on me - I haven't seen it since. But the cartoon ends with an optimistic note, and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. The second only to Warner Bro's cartoon "Peace on Earth" is the most I have ever been moved by an animated card.
