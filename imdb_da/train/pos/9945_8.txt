First thing first! This is not an action movie, although there are a lot of actions in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable, win a game or tournament without expectation! In this case, it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! In the beginning, these street fighters seem to be good for nothing! But soon we will find out that they will not be bullies and actually get something in life! It's nice to see them struggle and training! I was surprised at how fun this movie was! From start to finish you will laugh your pants! The young Korean players are very convincing! Go see this wonderful good movie!
