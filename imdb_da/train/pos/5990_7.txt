I don't have much to add to what has been said before, but it is very much a movie of the time, and the first (and probably only) time that the studio hung entirely on Dead End Kids. <Br /> <br /> Warner has given the boys plenty of help, from director Ray Enright and an 'A' budget to an almost magical version of supporting actors. At each turn we get one of these pearl performances from real benefits. They are too many to list, but it seems that almost all of Warner's many (Sans's greatest stars) go through this picture. (See if you can see John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> The only best performance is from the always reliable Eduardo Cianelli as a bully with a Messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly as the Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din". He's something to see! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since Dead End. <br /> <br /> My bid for this is another feature of a double bill with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hooray for Warners!
