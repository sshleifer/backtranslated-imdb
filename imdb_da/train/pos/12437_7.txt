As a long time fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I saw this movie on DVD without much hope of pleasure; In fact, I expected to get rid of the remote within fifteen minutes. But instead, I thoroughly enjoyed this production, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and the director managed to tell the fashion magazine's story. They managed to avoid the trap by making a (bad) movie version of the books we are all so familiar with, instead choosing to concentrate on a period in the life of modesty that is only referred to in the Romans. <br /> <br /> As for the production values ​​(and I'm not a film student!): Yes, the film was filmed on a tight finance and time budget, and maybe it shows ... but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment? In this case, I do not think. Instead, we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and give a taste of her abilities. <br /> <br /> In terms of casting: because in unknown territory we are the only people who really matter, modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me, they were completely credible. The Alexandra City, described by some as wood and too thin to be a hero of action, brought on the screen Modesty's poise and coolness; her technique (when martial arts was needed), but most importantly personified the integrity of the core of the Modesty Blaise cannon. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this movie was produced to play Miramax's Modesty Blaise character, it was made quickly and cheaply, BUT ... I can't wait to see the next one production in this series of these producers - as long as they adhere to the core values ​​and characterization of the original stories!
