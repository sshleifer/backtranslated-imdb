You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? To see their heroes in action once more. That's how I feel about Doc Savage. I am a great fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only increased that sense of expectation. Then they decided to crawl elements from a series of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat different film. There is a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the "camp" elements, etc.) But Doc's spirit is there, and that's what they know of us with Doc and his crew. So in my long-term way, that's what I'm trying to say is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should check out this movie just to become familiar with the hero who inspired them all.
