What makes this movie so scary is the way it portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal guys. It is certainly not people who want to become professional filmmakers as they walk around in front of the camera, forget about script lines, etc. They only make the video as a diary to show 'the survivors' how normal their lives were. Their parents just think the boys are filming for a family home video. By examining other child attacks at their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what they should not do and they inform (usually in a stupid 'This Old House' kind) of any potential 'Andres and Calvin' who might see this video how to Make bombs, get weapons and don't get caught before Zero Day (the day of the attack).
