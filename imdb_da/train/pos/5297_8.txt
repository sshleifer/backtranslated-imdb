Went to watch this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines. I knew it looked like it was good, but it was much more fun than I thought it would be. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really weird like normal people if it makes sense. I get sick of movies showing teens as cookie cutter people like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and am eagerly waiting for it to be on DVD, Watch this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater, and I see no more than once very often.
