Stephen King was raised on flicks like this. -No flicks movies. <br /> <br /> Films like this and 'Jeepers Creepers' are "throwbacks" to the good "ol-day drive-in horror flicks. <br /> <br /> Anyone looking for a human condition theory must pass on this creativity because it is all this is ... everything will always be. <br /> <br /> Stop to waste what has already found itself as the garbage bin. -Good, fun, garbage! <br /> <br /> If you have had this here, I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers' 'Jeepers Creepers 2' 30 Days of Night '' Scarecrows '(' 88) 'The Live' 'Planet Terror' 'Death Proof' and 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'
