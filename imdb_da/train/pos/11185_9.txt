As this happens to be one of the most favorite novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I was not disappointed! Yes of course there are a few things I could choose, but I think the film is stuck in the book and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King movies mostly get a bad review, but it's one of the good ones. It's such a dark story that I guess why I like it .. and what's better than the dead come to life. And something about animals returning from the grave is also quite scary. If you've seen the movie make yourself a great service and now read the book !! It's a well-written play, the actors could have done a better job (I only say this to Rachel and Ellie .. she was so whinny) I liked everyone else much ... and most importantly to me .. it stuck true to the novel .
