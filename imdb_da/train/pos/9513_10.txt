A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son's friend. Brilliant starring, leading with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan), has done a fantastic job. Good acting of him again. He is an actor legend. Great deals also from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Casting is just too good. The reason is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. A great depiction of gangsters from the 1930s. In the 1930s this will certainly stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.Soundtrack is pretty good a movie movie. A great flip in totality shows what a father does to protect his son. Way underestimated to my taste. Deserved a fully deserved 10.
