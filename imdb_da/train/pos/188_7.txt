I'm a big classic movie, but just get into silent movies. A lot of silent movies don't keep my attention, but Show People is a remarkable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture. Davies in particular shows a wide range that she morphs from a giggly little bee to a starlet who takes herself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast movie with a fantastic selection of cameos of some of the greatest stars in the quiet era. The movie caught my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent movie. (I know it doesn't make sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that getting dialo cards is needed. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent movies. It's a fast and interesting movie with two of the silent era's best stars. Add in the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the list "must see" for all classic movie characters.
