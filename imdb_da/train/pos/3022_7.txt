Never realized that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) joined Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) in a movie together and enjoyed their big acting together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) had a role in this movie and had a bad accident in his bathroom that made him weak. This story deals with a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England in the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt a coal mine contract that will cause great damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then continuing to help him escape from an angry crowd of English miners threatening his life. The real bad guy in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers", which gives an excellent performance. Great Classic 1945 film without Humphrey Bogart.
