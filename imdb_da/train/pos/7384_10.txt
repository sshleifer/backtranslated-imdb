Whoopi was the only reason I saw Oscars that year. She is funny. Of course, there was a big serious side to the show. She was great not only because she is fun, but because she said some things that had to be said in a public forum. White people should be reminded that the Hollywood awards ceremonies, employment and representation are very unbalanced. There should be no need for "black" prices. The white bread, milquetoast nominees and judges must bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen in the air was the depth of bad taste. He had no business there. The fact is that this is the first Oscar presentation I have seen since "The Color Purple" was up for prizes. That voting made me see the shows until 2002. It is not to cushion other presenters. Billy Crystal is a rebellion.
